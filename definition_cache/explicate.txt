To explicate is to explain or interpret something, maybe putting it in plain terms to make it more
comprehensible for others. It might help to remember that it begins with ex-, like the word explain,
which is similar in meaning.

The verb explicate comes from the Latin explic√Ñ re, which means to unfold or unravel. This is a
good description of a word that means to explain something to make it clearer and more easily
understandable. Think of a puzzle or mystery: when you solve it, you sometimes have to explicate how
you arrived at the solution, telling how you used the clues given to find the answer.
