Hypercritical describes someone who is full of complaints. That friend you love but avoid going to
restaurant with because she thinks the burger is slightly cold, the fork's not shiny enough, the
bread too bready? Definitely hypercritical.

Make sure you don't mistake hypercritical for hypocritical. If you've ever felt hyper, you know it
means too much energy. So someone who is hypercritical puts too much energy into criticizing and
judging. But if you're hypocritical, it means you don't live by the high standards you claim you
have. Unfortunately, that means it's possible for a person to be both hypercritical and
hypocritical.
