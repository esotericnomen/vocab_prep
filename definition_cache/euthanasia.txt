Euthanasia is the act of causing a person or animal's death, without inflicting pain, to end
suffering, like when a veterinarian performs euthanasia on a dog that is in great pain and has no
chance of recovery.

To correctly pronounce euthanasia, remember that it sounds like youth in Asia. Euthanasia is
sometimes referred to as mercy killing, meant to spare a living thing a slow, painful death.
Originally a Greek word, euthanasia means  an easy or happy death, as eu- means good and thanatos
means death. The use of the word as legally sanctioned mercy killing is first recorded in English in
1869.
