If you are the oldest child, you might bear the brunt of your parents' anger, even if you are not
the instigator of the misdeed. Brunt means the worst part of something.

When Canadian geese fly south, they travel in a V-formation, with the bird at point bearing the
brunt of the headwind. One way to remember the word brunt is that words that sound like
itâ&euro;&rdquo;grunt and bluntâ&euro;&rdquo;are also about being tough or absorbing pain.
