A courier is a person you trust with delivering important messages or packages. Let the mailman
deliver your electric bill and the form letter from the “Save the Orchids” foundation, but only
trust a courier with your book contract or birth certificate..

Couriers are in a hurry. Do they saunter up your driveway the way a mail carrier does? No! Couriers
are clearly on important business; they’re jogging. The word comes from a Latin word, currere,
meaning “to run.” Nowadays, you might see couriers on bicycles, however, weaving in and out of
traffic to deliver your messages on time.
