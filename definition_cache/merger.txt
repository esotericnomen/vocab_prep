When two companies become one company, they've had a merger. A merger is like a marriage for things
other than people.

It might help you remember merger to think of something that happens on the highway: several lanes
sometimes have to merge into one lane. Merging leads to more than one thing becoming one. Words that
mean something similar to merger are unification and fusion. Separation and break-up are opposites
of a merger.
