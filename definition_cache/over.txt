If something is over it is finished, across, or above. When a movie is over, you get up and leave. A
blanket that's over your feet covers your toes. A painting over a fireplace hangs above it.

Over is related to the German word ç«¯ber, meaning above, like putting one piece of paper over
another, or a ruling over your school, you popular person. Over can describe a distant position:
your phone is over there. Or it can mean throughout an area, like traveling over roads and oceans,
or going over the plan before the team starts working.
