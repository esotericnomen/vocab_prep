If you devote long hours to the arts of attention and analysis, you might develop the perspicacity
required to become a really good detective.

Perspicacity comes from the Latin word for penetrating sight. If you have perspicacity, you are good
at discerning what is really going on where others might only see surface clues. Perspicacity is a
quality that many professionals need, from detectives to doctors to therapists. If someone is
perspicacious, we might also say they have a shrewd mind, or a keen intelligence.
