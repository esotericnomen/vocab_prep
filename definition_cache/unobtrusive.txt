Use the adjective unobtrusive to describe something that doesn’t attract much attention, like an
unobtrusive waiter who doesn't interrupt diners to rattle off the nightly specials, or an
unobtrusive stain on the floor that your parents haven't noticed.

When you need to blend in, look to the word unobtrusive, which is pronounced un-ob-TROO-sive.
Unobtrusive can describe anyone — or anything — that is not very noticeable, such as the
unobtrusive black parka that makes you look more or less like everyone else on the city streets in
winter, or the unobtrusive security cameras at your bank.
