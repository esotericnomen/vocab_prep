If you twist your body into a contortion, you might put one leg behind your ear, and clasp your arms
behind your back. A contortion is a twisted position.

Yoga can feel like a series of contortions to beginners. People who twist their bodies into
contortions professionally are called contortionists. In order to become a contortionist, you need
to start with a lot of flexibility and a willingness to contort your body into uncomfortable
positions. You then need a lot of practice. It is not easy to achieve a perfectly freakish
contortion.
