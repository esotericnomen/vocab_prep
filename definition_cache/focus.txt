Focus is something that camera lenses and sleepy students are always being asked to do. For cameras,
it means finding a point where the subject is clear or in focus. For students, it means paying
attention.

Focus is all about finding a center â&euro;&rdquo; of a parabolic curve, of a lens, of a meditative
state. In Latin, focus meant 'domestic hearth,' which just goes to show that not much has changed
â&euro;&rdquo; since kitchens remain the focus of the modern home. Focus can be used as a verb, as
in I need to focus on my work, so I can play video games later; and as a noun, as in What is the
focus of this essay? I can't tell, since the writer seems to be all over the place.
