Use the adjective vulnerable to describe something or someone open to being physically or
emotionally wounded, like a newborn chick or an overly sensitive teenager.

Vulnerable is from Latin and is based on vulnus wound. From its literal meaning, it has come to be
more often used for someone who is easily hurt or likely to succumb to temptation. It's best used
for a person whose feelings are so delicate that they can't withstand any criticism or pressure:
Don't speak harshly to her, she's very vulnerable today.
