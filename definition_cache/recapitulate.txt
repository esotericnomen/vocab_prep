To recapitulate means to go back and summarize. At the end of an oral report, you might say, So, to
recapitulate, I've made three points, and then you name them.

Recapitulate is a long, scary-looking word that actually means something simple and easy. It comes
from the Latin re- again and capitulum chapter, which comes from the word caput head. Think of
recapitulating––or recapping, for short––as putting nice little caps on all the bottles
you've opened up––tightening everything up.
