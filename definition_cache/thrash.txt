When you thrash someone, you beat them â€” literally, with your fists, or figuratively, by winning a
game or competition.

You can describe your game plan for a chess match this way: I plan to thrash that show-off in just
ten moves. You can also threaten to physically thrash someone, like a neighborhood bully who's been
known to thrash much smaller kids. Thrash was originally a sixteenth-century variation on the word
thresh, which means to separate grain from wheat or another plant by beating it.
