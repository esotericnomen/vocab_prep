Deft means showing cleverness and skill in handling things. What you want to see in football or
basketball is some deft handling of the ball.

Some people are physically deft, like accomplished athletes and ballet dancers. Their movements are
fast, graceful, and deliberate. Others might be mentally or intellectually deft. You could describe
a beautifully written essay as deft, or talk about a politician's deft work on an anti-bullying
bill. The source of deft is the Old English gedĂŚfte, mild or gentle, which became deft in Middle
English along with its meaning of apt, skillful, or adept.
