An undertaker is someone who prepares a body for burial or cremation. When a loved one dies, you'll
have to visit an undertaker.

An undertaker doesn't literally take you under after you die, but he or she does prepare your body
for burial or cremation and assists a family with all aspects of funeral arrangements. If someone in
your family dies, an undertaker can help you decide between burial and cremation. An undertaker can
help plan a wake and the details of the funeral service. Undertakers help you select a coffin or
urn. Of course, you will be making those choices for someone else Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; not for yourself.
