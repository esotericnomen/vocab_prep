A vigil is when you stay alert to guard something, as when you keep vigil over your hen house when
the foxes are out, or a vigil can be solemn — as when a candlelight vigil is held for victims of a
tragedy.

Vigil comes from the Latin word for awake, and all its meanings include the idea of watchfulness. If
you're attending a vigil or keeping vigil, you shouldn't expect to take a nap. The vigil is an apt
kind of demonstration for peace movements, as it's calm, non-violent, and solemn, with participants
standing quietly —  sometimes holding candles.
