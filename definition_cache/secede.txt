To secede is to go your own way, breaking off ties. Usually, this refers to one part of a country
that wants to become independent, like the South during the U.S. Civil War.

The Latin word secedere means â&euro;&oelig;go apartâ&euro;? and that's where secede comes from.
Don't confuse it with the much more common succeed. Your plan to secede from the state of New Jersey
and found a kingdom named Rusty, after your dog, is not likely to succeed.
