Something that happens to a person's thinking can lead to paranoia. You may believe that your
friends no longer like you, but it's just that your paranoia makes you suspicious of everyone.

Paranoia is from the Greek para-, beyond, irregular, and noos, mind. It is an irregularity of the
mind, a mental disorder that distorts a person's perception of what is real. Someone with paranoia
may believe that other people are out to get them or are watching them all the time. Doctors who
treat paranoia look for causes, and while patients can develop the disorder gradually and sometimes
due to life circumstances, such as abuse or neglect, the use and abuse of drugs can also cause
paranoia.
