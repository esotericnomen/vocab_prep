Something chaotic is really out of control or disorganized. Chaotic starts with a hard K sound (kay-
AH-tick), but things that are chaotic are usually not OK, they're crazy disordered, like your
crammed locker at the end of the school year.

Chaotic is an adjective that comes from the noun chaos, meaning complete and total confusion or lack
of order. Your teacher might find it chaotic inside the bus on the way home from a field trip, with
so much talking and singing and stored up energy bouncing around. A classic example of something
chaotic is the running of the bulls in Spain, an event that lets people run the streets with a bunch
of huge, sharp-horned bulls. It's totally chaotic!
