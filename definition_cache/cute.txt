The adjective cute describes something that’s attractive in a pleasing, nonthreatening way. Things
that are small or young are often described as cute, like babies, puppies, or toy fire engines.

Something that’s cute is easy to like. We usually use cute to describe how something looks, like
your cute smile or your cute dimples, but you can use it for anything that’s endearing or
pleasing, like the boy-gets-girl ending to a romantic comedy. Cute can also refer to something
that’s overly clever and a little bit fake. Don’t be too cute when you fill out a college
application — the person reading it might not think it’s so funny.
