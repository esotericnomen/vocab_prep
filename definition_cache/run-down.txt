Use the adjective run-down to describe something that's so old it's falling apart, like a beat up
old car or a worn out mattress with springs sticking out of it.

A dingy neighborhood that's seen better days can be called run-down, and so can your decrepit
apartment building, with its broken elevator, creaky stairs, and windows that don't close all the
way. A person can also be run-down, if he is bent and elderly, or just exhausted from traveling for
days or working too many late nights. You can also spell it rundown, although the hyphenated run-
down is more common.
