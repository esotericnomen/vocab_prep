If you show up for Thanksgiving dinner an hour late and covered in mud from a tag football game,
your parents will give you a look of disapprobation. This means they seriously disapprove of your
actions, despite the fact that you scored the winning touchdown.

Disapprobation is a noun for the state of total disapproval and condemnation. It is often used in
conjunction with a moral or social offense. Acts such as stealing an old lady's purse, defying your
teachers or parents, vandalizing, or being a lying sneak are all things that are going to earn you
disapprobation. But if you decide to change your evil ways and do something wonderful to earn
praise, you'll find yourself back on the side of approbation.
