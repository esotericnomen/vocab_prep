Inquisitor is what you call someone who asks questions in an aggressive way, like a prosecutor in a
courtroom, or a parent who wants to know everything you did last night.

This word comes from 4th century Rome, where the Church hired religious detectives, called
Inquisitors, to root out people who disobeyed the Church's rules. So inquisitors have always been
aggressive, even though there's nothing particularly harsh or aggressive about the Latin root
quĂŚrere, which simply means ask or seek.
