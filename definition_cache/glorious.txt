When something is fabulous and wonderful it can be described as glorious, like the glorious sight of
the first flowers in your yard after a long, cold winter.

The adjective glorious comes from the Latin word gloriosus, which means “full of glory,” or
“famous.” What are some glorious things? The Grand Canyon, the Golden Gate Bridge, an Olympian's
athleticism, the towering skyscrapers of New York City, autumn sunlight filtering through a forest
of changing leaves, and the list goes on. If it is beautiful, amazing, fantastic and awe-inspiring,
it’s glorious.
