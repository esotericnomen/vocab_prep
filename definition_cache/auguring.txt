To augur is to predict, but what's tricky about the word is that it pertains to an object or an
event. A black cat is an augur of bad luck––it brings bad luck. Seeing one doesn't augur well
for your future.

It used to be that when you said you would augur the future, it meant you would predict it. Now,
that form has gone out of use, but the sense of prediction connected to an object or event remains.
Dark clouds augur a rainstorm in the near future. If you skip a dress rehearsal before opening night
of a show, it won’t augur well for your performance.
