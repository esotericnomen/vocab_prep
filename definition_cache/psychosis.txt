If your Uncle Marvin starts talking to his furniture and sewing his own clothes out of newspapers,
he may be suffering from psychosis, which is a serious psychiatric illness in which a person loses
touch with reality.

The Greek psykhe, or mind combines with the Latin suffix -osis, abnormal condition, to form the word
psychosis. An abnormal condition of the mind sounds like it could describe a lot of mental
conditions, and in fact psychosis is a broad term that covers many different disorders. The symptom
that those who suffer from psychosis have in common is that they don't experience reality in the
same way that most people do; they may hallucinate, or see and hear things that aren't really there.
