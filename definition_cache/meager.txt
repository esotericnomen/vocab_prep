Meager means small and often applies to portions. Meager is the serving of chocolate cake your
mother will allows you––or the amount of vegetables you actually want to eat before getting to
that cake.

Meager doesn't mean adequate––it means not enough. People with a limited supply of food may try
to subsist on meager portions. People who make a meager amount of money probably have a hard time
making rent. Meager and emaciated both derive from the Old French maigre. If you can remember that
you will look emaciated if your diet is meager, you’ll use the word correctly.
