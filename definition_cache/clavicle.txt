The clavicle, more commonly known as the collarbone, connects your shoulder blade to you sternum.

The clavicle is the only long horizontal bone in the body (all the other long bones are vertical,
such as those in the arms and legs). It evolved to provide a structural support for the arms, and
also to serve as protection around blood vessels and nerves in that part of the body. The clavicles
of birds are Y-shaped and, on a holiday turkey, are also called the wishbone.
