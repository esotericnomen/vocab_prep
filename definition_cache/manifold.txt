Manifold is a smarty-pants way to say varied, many, or multiple. There are many good reasons to
expand your vocabulary, so you could say the benefits of learning new words are manifold.

Manifold sounds like many fold, which is what it is Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; something with many features,
like a wallet with lots of folds so stuffed with junk that makes you sit funny when it's in your
back pocket. As an adjective, manifold loves to appear in books, like Mrs. Gryce in Edith Wharton's
The House of Mirth, whose domestic duties were manifold. As a noun, a manifold is a pipe branching
into many openings, often found in car engines.
