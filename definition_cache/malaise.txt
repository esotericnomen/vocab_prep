If you are experiencing malaise, chances are you are feeling blue or looking green. Malaise is a
slump; you're not feeling your best â€” either mentally or physically.

Mal is French for bad, and aise means ease. When experiencing malaise, ease yourself down on the
couch to recover. Malaise is frequently used figuratively to describe slumps that other things go
through as well. The 20-year economic malaise in Japan is one example, but you'll also hear of
educational malaise, political malaise, and even a general malaise. Wherever you turn, there's
malaise.
