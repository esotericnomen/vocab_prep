Felicitous describes something that's really pleasant. If someone behaves in a felicitous manner,
she's being agreeable and appropriate. You know, the way you should behave when your great aunt
offers you those stale candies.

Felicitous also describes something that's happy or lucky. When you plan a trip to the amusement
park and it turns out that the sun is shining, thatâ&euro;&trade;s felicitous. If you need to mail
a package by a certain date and you make it to the post office just in time, thatâ&euro;&trade;s
also felicitous. Felicitous can also describe something that's well chosen. Planning an outdoor
wedding for the dead of winter would not be felicitous.
