Bestial sounds like beast, and that is precisely what it means, beast-like. When a human acts like
an animal, their behavior is called bestial.

Bestial is often used to describe behavior that is primitive or uncivilized. If someone living on a
desert island took to grunting and crawling on all fours searching for bugs in dirt, you could say
she had descended to the bestial.
