A methodology is a plan-of-attack, especially when that plan-of-attack is used repeatedly.

This might be obvious, but the word methodology is related to the word method. In fact, a
methodology is a system of methods followed consistently. Scientists, for example, use various
methodologies as they perform experiments. It might seem like the world is nothing but chaos and
disorder. But actually, sometimes there is a method to this madness. And sometimes
there√¢&euro;&trade;s a methodology.
