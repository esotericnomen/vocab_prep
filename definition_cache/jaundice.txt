Jaundice is a medical condition that causes a slight yellowing of the skin. Many newborn babies are
diagnosed with slight jaundice and need to spend time in the sunlight every day for a few weeks.

A patient with jaundice looks a little yellow, a condition that's caused by excess pigmentation due
to deficiencies in the liver or bile duct. One common medical cause of jaundice is hepatitis, a
liver condition. Another meaning of jaundice is the distortion of opinions due especially to envy or
resentment: I hope my winning another acting award won't jaundice your feelings about being in
plays. The Latin root is galbinus, greenish yellow, a color once associated with bitterness and
envy.
