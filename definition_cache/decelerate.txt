Use the verb decelerate when you want to slow down, like when you realize you are missing important
moments in life by racing around, trying to do everything yourself. If you make an effort to
decelerate, you might be happier â€” and healthier.

Decelerate is the opposite of accelerate, which means to go faster. Decelerate often describes
slowing a vehicle, but it can relate to nearly anything, like a friendship that begins with hanging
out nearly every day but decelerates when you move to a new town or get busy with school and sports.
It doesn't mean the friendship is ending or over, just that the pace is now a little slower.
