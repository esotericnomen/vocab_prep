Bambi, beware. Venison is deer meat intended as food.

Venison is derived from the medieval French word venesoun, which originally described the meat of
any large animal, not just deer. Back then, venison was as common as a Big Mac today (rather than as
the fairly classy meal it's considered today). In Britain, before 1066, when the French came over
and conquered them, the Brits had pretty simple names for their meat: cow, pig, deer, etc. The
French, with their high regard for cuisine, changed all that, and the names became beef, bacon, and
venison. The British, though, despite the fancy new names, famously refused to take cooking as
seriously as their new French rulers.
