A lever is a handle, sticking out at an angle, that allows you to operate a machine or close a door
. When you pull the lever of a voting booth, you both cast your ballot and open the curtain.

All kinds of things â&euro;&rdquo; particularly machines â&euro;&rdquo; have levers. The word is
also used to describe anything that you are able to use to move or influence someone else: think
leverage. A headline in the New York Times said the government would use its contracts with private
companies as a wage lever, meaning the government would try to improve wages by giving work and
money to companies that paid well and provided generous benefits. Levers get things done.
