To wreak is to cause something to happen, usually with a terrible consequence. You can make
mischief, cause problems, or inflict pain, but to wreak damage suggests a deeper level of
destruction.

Wreak stems from the Old English wrecan, meaning to avenge. Its current meaning, that of causing
something to happen â&euro;&rdquo; usually with dire consequences â&euro;&rdquo; came about in the
19th century. The word is a transitive verb, often paired with the equally intense havoc, meaning
devastation.
