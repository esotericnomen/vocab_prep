Even though he was homeless, Dan had a regal bearing. Regal is an adjective that describes things
that appear to be royal.

There are several synonyms for regal, but they all have slightly different meanings. Reserve regal
for those instances when the person or thing truly seems like it wants to be the queen, actually is
the queen, or looks like it might belong to the queen.     My French teacher has a truly regal
bearing: she stands stick-straight, with her chin in the air, and acts as though she's the queen and
we're her court. A regal attitude from a trembling Chihuahua is the height of irony: that little
bugger couldn't rule a cat-box, let alone a whole country.
