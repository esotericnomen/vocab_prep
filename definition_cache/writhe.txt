To writhe is to squirm and twist. Often you'll see the phrase to writhe in agony. Writhe when you've
just ingested some stomach-wrenching poison, or perhaps in response to red ant stings.

Writhe stems from the Old English, meaning to twist or bend. It's not a coincidence that a Christmas
wreath is greenery twisted and bent into a circle.  A person can writhe in embarrassment but it's
usually reserved for times when pain or discomfort cause you to twist and bend over and squirm
because your body is in such distress.
