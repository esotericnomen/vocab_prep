Clangor is one of those words that means exactly what it sounds like, so you can feel free to
describe the noise your brother makes when he's banging on his drums in the basement as a clangor.

The word clangor brings to mind clanking sounds, but it can also be used to mean any kind of
resounding, deafening noise, such as the shouting of a crowd. When you instinctively know what a
word means just by the way it sounds â&euro;&rdquo; like clangor â&euro;&rdquo; that's called
onomatopoeia.
