When you're entrenched, you're dug in. Sometimes that means you're literally in a trench, but
usually it means you just won't budge from a position or belief.

Entrenched things are buried so solidly that they can't move -- or just behave like they're firmly
lodged in some deep hole. Usually this word refers to views people hold very strongly. Having turkey
on Thanksgiving is a tradition that's entrenched in American culture -- it's long been established
and isn't going anywhere. When you're entrenched, you're being stubborn or consistent, depending on
your view.
