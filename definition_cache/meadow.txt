The noun meadow is another word for a hayfield, but offers a much more picturesque view as an open
field of lush grass filled with butterflies and birds, with room to run. It can also refer to a
piece of land found along a river.

The word meadow refers to any grassland or hayfield, often just an expansive area that should be
mowed. Indeed, the word comes from the Old English word mæd from the Germanic  mædwon the base of
which means “mow.” Still, the bucolic feeling is retained, as Dale Carnegie put it: “Let us
not get so busy or live so fast that we can't listen to the music of the meadow or the symphony that
glorifies the forest.
