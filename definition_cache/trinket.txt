The word trinket refers to an inexpensive, flashy ornament or piece of jewelry. A rhinestone brooch
to pin to your jacket is a showy trinket that won't break the bank.

Trinkets aren't always made to be worn like jewelry. The word trinket can also refer to novelty
items such as silly magnets with sayings on them or keepsake spoons. If you've ever stopped into a
store at the airport that sells goods like keychains, mugs, and buttons, then you've seen trinkets.
Trinkets are often purchased on a vacation Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; they're small enough to stick into your
pockets before you board the plane home.
