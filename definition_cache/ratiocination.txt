Take your time and think things through logically. That's what it means to use ratiocination to
solve a problem.

To correctly pronounce ratiocination say, rat-ee-oh-seh-NA-shun. Ratiocination uses reason or logic
to figure something out. It might involve determining probabilities, syllogisms, even mathematical
formulas, or simply following all the steps in a process that you believe will lead you to the
correct or best answer. Ratiocination is the opposite of taking a wild guess or just going with your
gut.
