If you eschew something, you deliberately avoid it. If you live the bohemian life in the city, then
most likely you eschew the suburbs.

Eschew comes from a word meaning dread, or shun. So to eschew something isn’t simply to avoid it,
the way you would avoid walking in a puddle––it's stronger than that. You eschew things that you
find morally or aesthetically wrong, or that you have chosen to find wrong. A dieter might eschew a
chocolate sundae, not because he doesn’t like it, but because he’s afraid of what it will do to
his waistline.
