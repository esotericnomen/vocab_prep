If you get into trouble and are sent to the principal’s office, be prepared for the principal to
reprove you for your behavior. To reprove is to scold, reprimand, or — in plain English —
“chew out.”

Reprove is a verb used in the same way as “scold,” or “dress down.” To reprove is to express
your dissatisfaction or disapproval with something. It’s a less severe word than denounce or
decry. It is closer to the verb criticize. Your parents might reprove you for a minor offense like
not cleaning your room or chewing with your mouth open. And, for the record, reprove is not the root
word prove with the prefix re- as if to mean “prove again.” If you use it that way, someone
would likely reprove you.
