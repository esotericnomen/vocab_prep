Originally meaning only to gather soldiers, muster's definition has been expanded to include
gathering up just about anything––you can muster up some dinner, some friends, or even some
ketchup, pickles and mustard.

Remember that muster used to involve getting reluctant soldiers out of bed and into the field of
battle––it involves overcoming a certain inertia. When you muster up the courage to face
something, it's clear that this is pretty scary for you.
