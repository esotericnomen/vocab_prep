If all stipulations aren't met, the deal's off. By not reading the contract's  fine print, you

The Latin root of stipulation is stipulat-, meaning “demanded as a formal promise.” The judge
might allow you to go free, with the stipulation that you never again go swimming in a public
fountain. A nightly foot massage could be one of many stipulations detailed in your “dating
agreement.” Right or left tonight?
