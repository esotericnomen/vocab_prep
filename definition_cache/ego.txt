Your ego is your conscious mind, the part of your identity that you consider your self. If you say
someone has a big ego, then you are saying he is too full of himself.

Poor ego, it gets such a bad rap, being so often confused with megalomania and vanity and all kinds
of other nasty things, but strictly speaking it is only a psychological term popularized by Freud
meaning the conscious (as opposed to the unconscious) mind, or the awareness of one's own identity
and existence. Nothing wrong in that, is there?
