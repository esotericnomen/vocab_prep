Satire is a way of making fun of people by using silly or exaggerated language. Politicians are easy
targets for satire, especially when they're acting self-righteous or hypocritical.

Even though the ridiculous language of satire isn't intended to be taken seriously, well-made satire
can use mockery to get at more serious truths. Sometimes satire can even overtake reality: when the
television sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live presented a mock debate between Al Gore and George
W. Bush during the 2000 presidential campaign season, the satire was so dead-on that it influenced
the way people thought of the candidates.
