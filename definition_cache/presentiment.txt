Do you ever have the feeling that something bad is about to happen? That’s called a presentiment.

The word presentiment comes from the Latin word præsentire, meaning “to sense beforehand.” Some
people call it a gut feeling. For example, if you leave for a trip and something doesn't feel right,
you may chalk it up to just being nervous. But later, when your flight is cancelled and you lose
your luggage, you may remember that little twinge — the presentiment that something bad was about
to happen.
