Don't have a fit about it! someone might snap at you. Chances are you're making a fuss and acting
out, characteristics that precisely fit or match what having a fit involves. Chill out.

When something fits like a glove, it fits just right. When you put a glove on, you fit each finger
into its place. The word fit can mean matching the shape of something or being a good match, like
two people who meet online and turn out to be a good fit for one another. But its definitions are
not always so rosy. If you're really angry and find yourself throwing a tantrum, you're having a
fit.
