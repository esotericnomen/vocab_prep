You can requite a friend’s kindness by doing your friend a favor or by being kind in return.
Requite means to repay or return.

To requite something is to return it. However, saying that you want to requite a gift means that you
want to give something in return for it — not that you want to return the gift to the store for
some quick cash. Requite is often used in the context of love; if you requite someone’s love, you
love that person back. Requite can also be used in a negative sense. Someone who wants to requite an
injury wants payback for it.
