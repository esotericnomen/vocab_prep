Novelty is a newness or refreshing quality. Many college freshmen enjoy the novelty of living on
their own — until it comes time to do that first load of laundry.

You'll often hear people talk about the novelty of a new experience —  imagine the excitement and
anticipation of cracking open a novel you’ve never read before to help remember the word. But
novelty is also a term for a small toy or trinket, usually mass-produced. Novelty shops sell all
kinds of funny knickknacks, from personalized flashlight key chains to stuffed singing hamsters.
