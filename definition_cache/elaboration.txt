Elaboration means adding details. Kids are famous for answering, Good, when asked how school was,
and, Nothing, when asked what they learned. If pressed for elaboration, they will tell about their
classes and maybe even what they had for lunch.

Elaboration is the result of going that extra mile, such as when your history teacher asks for five
paragraphs on the Fall of Rome, and you write three pages, or when your friend, instead of giving
you a regular birthday card, creates a mini-scrapbook with photos and mementos from the past year.
As you can see, elaboration takes time and energy because you go into greater detail than usual.
