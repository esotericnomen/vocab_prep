Whether it is the spikes on the wire atop a security fence or a mean remark someone said about you,
barbs can hurt. When you encounter either kind of barb, you should stay away.

Barb comes from the Latin word barba, which means â&euro;&oelig;beard.â&euro;? Beards offer
protection from things like cold and wind, but as Mommy found out when she kissed Santa Claus, they
can also be quite scratchy. Perhaps this is why, when it comes to talking about beards, some people
speak nothing but barbs.
