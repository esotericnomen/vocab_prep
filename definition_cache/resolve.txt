To resolve is to settle or make a decision about something â€” often formal. A college's board of
directors  might resolve to recruit more minority students. As a noun, resolve refers to a strong
determination to do something.

If you make a New Year's resolution to exercise every day, you'll need plenty of resolve to stick
with your program. The verb descends from Middle English resolven to dissolve, from Latin resolvere
to untie. In English, the obsolete sense of to dissolve can be seen in this line from Shakespeare:
O, that this too too solid flesh would melt, thaw, and resolve itself into a dew.
