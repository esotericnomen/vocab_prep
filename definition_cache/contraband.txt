Contraband means illicit goods and usually refers to stuff that's imported or exported illegally,
like drugs, weapons, and certain exotic pets (like tigers).

Contra means against (contradict, contrary) and bando means ban, so contraband simply means against
a ban, or despite the rules. Place of origin: Italy. Somehow the word got imported by the English,
but there aren't any laws against word-importation, so it would be a stretch to say that contraband
is itself contraband.
