An opus is a created work, usually musical in nature. The composer's greatest opus was inspired by
the blooming of the spring flowers.

While an opus is a piece of work, usually musical, the best way to remember it is to know what the
preferred plural of opus is opera which everyone associates with music. You can also say opuses for
the plural if you want, but how is that going to help you remember anything? A common usage of opus
is with the term magnum opus which refers to one√¢&euro;&trade;s greatest work, musical or
otherwise.
