Carnage is mass murder. If you have seen news footage of a village after a bomb has been detonated,
you probably saw a scene of carnage.

Carnage comes from the Latin carnaticum, meaning flesh or slaughter of animals. Carnage is often
used to describe the brutal killing of many people, but can also refer to large numbers of animals
that have been butchered.
