Logical describes something that comes from clear reasoning. Using a fire extinguisher to put it out
a fire is a logical step. Trying to put it out with gasoline is not.

The adjective logical is rooted in the Greek word logos, which means reason, idea, or word. So
calling something logical means it's based on reason and sound ideas Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; in other words,
thought out with mathematical precision and removed from emotion. Sounds strict and boring, but it's
the orderliness and consistency of logic that helps you write a great argument or figure out how to
solve a problem.
