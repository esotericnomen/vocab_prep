Pernicious means harmful and subtle, such as a poison gas that causes cancer in those exposed to it
over the course of years.

Pernicious comes from the Latin perniciosus, for destructive, which in turn comes from pernicies,
for death or ruin. You might have heard your parents and teachers talk about the pernicious effects
of watching too much TV and playing video games all dayâ&euro;&ldquo;â&euro;&ldquo;they'll turn
your brain to mush.
