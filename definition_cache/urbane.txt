Urbane people are sophisticated, polished, cultured, refined. Spend enough time in an urban
setting–-going to concerts, museums, spending time in crowds––and you'll be urbane too.

Both urbane and urban derive from the Latin urbanus, city, but while urban has connotations of
gritty living and crime, urbane assumes that everyone sees the city from the roof deck of their
penthouse apartment, drinking champagne and exchanging bon mots with friends. Add a Cole Porter
soundtrack and the image is complete.
