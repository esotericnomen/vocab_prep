One of the less glamorous parts of parenthood is being responsible for an incontinent newborn who
can't control the urge to urinate or defecate.

Incontinent is an adjective that describes someone who “goes to the bathroom” without actually
being able to make it to the bathroom. Babies and children are incontinent until they are potty-
trained and adults can be incontinent as a result of illness or injury. The -continent part of the
word doesn’t have anything to do with geography, but rather is from a Latin word meaning
“holding together.”
