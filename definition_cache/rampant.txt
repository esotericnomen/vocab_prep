Rampant means wild, out of control, to be up on your hind legs roaring at the world. You don't have
to be four-legged: The children ran rampant at the supermarket even though their mother tried to
control them.

If you're running rampant, you're on a rampage. Both come from the French word ramper meaning to
climb, creep like an animal on hind legs, paws in climbing-mode, or like wild plants such as the
kudzu that ran rampant over an old barn until the entire thing was covered. There can also be
rampant wildfires that destroy houses in the Southwest, or robots that run rampant in the lab after
the janitor accidentally sets them free.
