If you believe in an afterlife, you probably realize that making lots of money is only an earthly
concern, and not something that matters in heaven.

Religious believers make the distinction between earthly problems and things that are far more
important in the long term. Usually, these earthly worries have to do with material things, like
jobs, money, cars, and houses Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; rather than spiritual concerns like love, faith, and
beauty. The word earth is at the root of earthly, and you can think of it as things that only matter
to humans on the Earth.
