If something is inane, it's silly or senseless. If you just want to space out, you won't mind the
inane chatter on TV, as long as it's on.

Inane comes from the Latin inanis, for empty, and you can think of it as empty-headed.  We call
something inane if it states the obvious, or is really silly in a way that seems unintelligent. If
you give your boss a presentation in a bunny suit and sing a song about being happy, she might say,
Get out of here with your inane bunny act!  Other synonyms are stupid, vacuous, ridiculous,
pointless.
