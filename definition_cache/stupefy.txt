Don't be embarrassed if the magician's tricks stupefy you. It means you're amazed. Who doesn't want
to be stopped in his tracks sometimes?

Stupefy looks a lot like stupid. But intelligence has nothing to do with being stupefied, which
comes from Latin and means to make stunned. Anyone can be stupefied by something scary, mysterious,
or just plain remarkable. Think of tourists visiting New York City for the first time. They stare up
at the skyscrapers, lost in wonder. Taking that moment to let themselves be amazed? Nothing stupid
about it, unless they step on someone's foot, of course.
