One of the reasons Mafia bosses are so good at avoiding prison is that they know how to suborn
witnesses and jurors â€” that is, to bribe people to lie. After all, it wouldn't be nice if an
accident were to happen on the way to court, right?

Technically speaking, suborn doesn't just mean induce someone to conveniently forget something in
the witness stand, or otherwise get creative with their imagination. An inducement to any kind of
crime is suborning, but by far the most common use is in the legal sense above. Or witness
tampering, as the cops call it.
