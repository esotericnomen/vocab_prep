In some cultures, the bride or her family pays a certain amount of money or property to the groom
when a couple is married. This payment is called a dowry.

Traditionally, a woman's family offered a dowry to potential husbands in order to make the match
more attractive to the man and his family. The word dowry can actually mean payment, but it can also
refer to whatever property or savings a woman herself brings into a marriage. The Latin word dotare
is the root of dowry, and it means to endow or to portion out.
