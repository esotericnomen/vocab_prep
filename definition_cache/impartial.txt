If you're in a contest you'd better hope the judges are impartial, that is, that they aren't biased
toward one competitor over another.

When someone's partial to something they take its part. Impartial means no part has yet been taken.
In most high school elections, teachers strive to create an impartial atmosphere, to keep it from
appearing to be a popularity contest.
