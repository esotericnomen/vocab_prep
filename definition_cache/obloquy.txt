If you are on the receiving end of obloquy, then society has turned against you and you are in a
state of disgrace. Poor Hester Prynne who was forced to wear a red A on her chest for adultery knows
all about obloquy.

If you break the word obloquy into its two Latin roots, you have ob, meaning “against” and
loqui, meaning to speak — so obloquy means “to speak against, in an especially mean way. Obloquy
can also be the result of public shame, or criticism. Get scolded in front of the other shoppers by
the grocery store manager for knocking over a display of bottles, and you will understand what
obloquy is!
