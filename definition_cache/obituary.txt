An obituary is the notice of someone's death. It is placed in the newspaper to alert others to the
death. It gives a background about the deceased's life, usually listing survivors and giving funeral
information.

The noun obituary, which appears in English in the early 18th century, comes from the Latin ob朝re,
where ob- means toward, and 朝re, to go, suggesting a going toward one's death. The first obituary
as we know it probably appeared shortly after the invention of the printing press and included just
the bare facts of the death. In 19th-century England, the announcements became more elaborate, and
photos were added in the 20th century, making the modern obituary more like an elaborate eulogy.
