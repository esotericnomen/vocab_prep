When things cohere, they come together in a meaningful way. It wasn't until we won a game that our
team finally cohered, and we actually felt like a unit.

Co- means together, and here is from the Latin haerÄ“re, to stick. Put them together and you have to
stick together. When people work together on a project, it's important that their ideas cohere,
otherwise the work can seem disjointed and awkward. The beauty of the dance was in the timing:
everyone was so in step that they seemed to cohere into one great mass of humanity. If the
president's staff doesn't cohere into a cohesive unit, his policies will never come together either.
