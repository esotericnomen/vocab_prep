If something is pristine it's immaculately clean or has never been used. So please check your shoes
before walking on a pristine white carpet.

A long, long time ago pristine was used to describe primitive or ancient things. It
wasn√¢&euro;&trade;t until 1899 that the word grew to mean unspoiled or pure. Ecologists strive to
preserve pristine rain forests, just as vacationers are always looking for a pristine strip of beach
to lounge on. A new car should arrive to you in pristine condition, and hopefully you'll do your
best to keep it that way.
