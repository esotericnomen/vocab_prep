The Freshman 15 describes freshman-year college students who gain about fifteen pounds because they
consume way too much lousy dorm food all day long.

To consume a cake is to eat it, the idea being that you ate the whole thing. To say a fire consumed
a building is to say that the entire building was destroyed. Consume means to devour, to take in, to
use up. The Unites States is often referred to as a consumer society because our economy is based on
things being consumed. Whether it's gas, clothes, burgers, music, or anything that we use up as we
purchase it, it's something that we consume. If we consume all the oil, there will be none left to
burn.
