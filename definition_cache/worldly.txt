You can use the adjective worldly to describe people who have knowledge of many topics or experience
in many areas. You don't have to travel the globe to be worldly; reading and talking about many
things with knowledge and enthusiasm is worldly too.

While worldly often describes individuals who are sophisticated and well-rounded in education,
travel, and experiences, it's also used for people who are rooted in the world or focused on
physical and material things around them, rather than on spiritual matters. An old expression in
religion is She was too heavenly minded for worldly good, and it describes those who think about the
spiritual or supernatural so much that they aren't worldly enough to get anything done.
