When you mangle something, you completely destroy it, by ripping, cutting, crushing, or otherwise
mauling it into pieces.

You shouldn't leave your new puppy alone in a room with your favorite shoes because he might mangle
them with his sharp puppy teeth. A bad accident will mangle your bicycle, bending it beyond repair,
and a paper shredder mangles a document by slicing it up. You can also use the word mangle to
describe what happens when your uncle's terrible bluegrass band performs a cover of your favorite
classic rock song Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; they mangle it.
