There is nothing content, or satisfying, about being in contention, and that's probably because the
word contention means being in a competition that ends with one side, usually the winning one, being
content.

And in this corner, the contender is heard at most boxing matches to describe each of the fighters
about to go into contention in the ring. Sometimes, though, a contention can be a battle of words or
a struggle between two parties over a single point. The expression bone of contention describes a
narrow object of disagreement that reaches the level of strife, or contention. For two hungry dogs,
though, the bone of contention might be a serious matter.
