What do Ophelia, Snow White, and Sandy from the movie Grease all have in common? You could call each
one an ingénue, or a young female character in literature or film who is wholesome and innocent.

Ingénue comes from the French ingénu meaning ingenuous, innocent. The term is used to describe the
innocent girl stock character in film or literature. She's usually gentle, sweet, virginal, and
pretty naive — which makes her susceptible to the harsh dangers of the world. Ingénue can also be
used to describe an actress who specializes in playing this kind of character specifically.
