If you're not overly strict, and you show tolerance and mercy when someone does something wrong,
you're being lenient.

Lenient means tolerant or relaxed, and is usually used when weâ&euro;&trade;re talking about
someoneâ&euro;&trade;s attitude toward discipline. In 19th-century child-rearing books, we often
read about strict teachers who punish children just for squirming in their seats. These days
teachers are more likely to be lenient, more understanding. If you're a big fan of discipline and
punishment, however, lenient might mean soft or indulgent.
