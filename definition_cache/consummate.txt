If a restaurant is a consummate example of fine dining, you might say there's nothing more to say
about fine dining that what this restaurant represents. Consummate means complete or finished.

Consummate can be used to describe something good or bad: consummate joy, a consummate liar. To
consummate means to bring something to completion, but it often refers specifically to making a
marriage complete by having sexual relations. The adjective is pronounced KÄN-sə-mit, but the verb
is pronounced KÄN-sə-māt.
