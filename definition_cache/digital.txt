While digital refers to something that can be manipulated by the fingers (called digits), it also is
a type of electronic signal that uses a binary code (a system using numbers, or digits) to transmit
information.

The Latin digitus means finger or toe, so it makes sense that by adding the suffix -al, which means
being like, we get the adjective digital, fingerlike.  The idea of the word referring to numerals
began around 1938, soon becoming vital in computers. It's easy to imagine the connection between
fingers and numbers, as the first mathematical calculators were probably fingers and toes.  Digital
recording appeared in 1960 to challenge analog, soon becoming the broadcasting standard for clearer
signals.
