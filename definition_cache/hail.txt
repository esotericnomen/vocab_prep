Hail is when chunks of ice fall from the sky.  Also, to hail someone is to greet them or say good
things about them. Or it can be a way to tell people of your homeland, as in: I hail from the Moon.

If twenty third-graders all sent spit-balls up in the air at once, the spit-balls would then hail
down on the class.  If a presidential candidate has an idea for fixing the nation's woes, many
people will hail that idea as the next great panacea.  If you see your former prom date walking down
the street, you may want to hail him to say hello or, perhaps, you will want to hail a cab and get
out of there as fast as you can.
