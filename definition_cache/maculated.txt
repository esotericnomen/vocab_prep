If your little sister has a maculate appearance, she either needs a good wipe with a damp towel or
you should take her to the doctor straight away. A fairly technical word little used now, maculate
means spotted or blotchy.

There's another meaning for maculate, that of having a blemished or impure moral character. Now your
little sister doesn't have that, does she? You can also maculate something by either physically or
metaphorically polluting it Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; like a river or a relationship.
