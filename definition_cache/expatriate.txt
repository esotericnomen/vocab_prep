An expatriate is someone who lives in another country by choice. If you leave your split-level ranch
in Ohio and move to a writers' commune in Paris for good, you've become an expatriate.

Expatriate can also be a verb, so that American in Paris has expatriated. There was a scene of
expatriates, or expats, living in Paris in the roaring '20s that included writers like F. Scott
Fitzgerald and Gertrude Stein. The word used to mean to get kicked out of your native country
Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; it's from the French word expatrier which means banish. The prefix ex means out of
and  the Latin patria one's native country, but the word took a turn and now refers to people who
left without getting shoved out.
