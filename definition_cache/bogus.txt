Bogus means fakeâ€”a bogus dollar bill is counterfeit, a bogus Renoir was not painted by him, a
bogus attempt at reconciliation would come from someone who never intended to end a fight.

Perhaps appropriately, the word bogus originated in the US. Coined as a name for a machine that
printed counterfeit money, it later became a trademark term among California surfers. In surfer
speak, totally bogus, dude would describe any unfortunate situation.
