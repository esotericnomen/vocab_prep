A pan can be a cooking utensil, a negative opinion, or a sweeping camera shot. You cook eggs in a
pan, but as a film critic you might pan a new docudrama for poor editing and overuse of pan shots.

A pan is a shallow metal object that you use to cook food. It can also be a verb indicating you're
expressing a negative view. To pan a performance, book, or movie is to say that you think it stunk.
If all the critics pan something, sales usually go down, but not always. To pan a film or video
camera is to move it from left to right or right to left in a smooth motion.
