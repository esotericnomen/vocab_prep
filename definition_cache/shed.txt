The small, simple building in your yard where you keep tools or gardening equipment is a shed.

As a noun, shed means hut, and probably comes from the word shade. But shed is also a verb meaning
to cast off, like when a snake sheds its skin.  If your couch is covered in fur, it might be because
your dog is shedding.  You can shed non-physical things, like a bad habit.  Does your cat shed?  If
so, maybe I should sleep in the shed since I'm allergic.
