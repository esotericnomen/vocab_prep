Pathology is the medical term for the way a disease works. A tumor is removed by a doctor trained in
surgery, but you need a doctor trained in pathology to tell you if the tumor is cancer.

Pathology derives from the Greek pathos suffering and ology study of––to give us the study of
disease, but often pathology means the disease's behavior––the cancer pathology is to take over
healthy cells and grow cancerous tumors.  We also use pathology to describe abnormal conditions that
aren’t really diseases, like the pathology of Hollywood stars who live their lives in public and
become obsessed with fitness.
