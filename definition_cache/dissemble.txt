To dissemble is to hide under a false appearance, to deceive. When confronted about their human
rights record, the Chinese government typically dissembles.

Dissemble is a little more complicated than a straight lie or denial. When you dissemble, you
disguise your true intentions or feelings behind a false appearance. To dissemble is to pretend that
you don't know something, to pretend that you think one way when you act another way. My boyfriend
was dissembling the whole time. He was a married father of two.
