Amenities are the little things in life that make you comfortable — like more legroom on a flight
or the chocolate on your hotel pillow.

The noun amenities is used for things that make life more pleasant or comfortable. They can take the
form of luxurious perks like the hotel's spa and heart-shaped pool, or they could be more basic —
like air conditioning during a heat wave or Internet service in a library.
