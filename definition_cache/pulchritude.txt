If someone comments on the pulchritude of your face, you shouldn’t be offended. It may sound like
quite the opposite, but pulchritude actually means “beauty.”

Pulchritude is one of those words that is more often commented upon for its oddness than actually
used in its intended meaning. Many people dislike the sound of this word or are surprised to find
that it is a synonym of beauty. These days pulchritude is considered outdated and is usually only
used in highly literary writing or, in more common writing, to achieve a witty effect.
