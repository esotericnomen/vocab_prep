If you are snorkeling off the coast of Florida in water cut off from the main ocean, you are likely
in a lagoon — a body of water separated from the main ocean.

If you’re familiar with the 60s TV show “Gilligan’s Island,” you probably already know what
a lagoon is. Much of the show’s action took place at the lagoon, where the lovable castaways spent
their time hanging around and planning how to be rescued. A lagoon is a good place for castaways to
congregate because it’s shallow and separated from the ocean by a natural barrier, which means
it’s protected from the rough waters of the ocean and offers easier access for swimming and
fishing. If you’re ever stranded on a deserted island, you too would probably choose to spend your
time at the lagoon, staring into the distance and watching for approaching ships.
