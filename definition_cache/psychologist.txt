A psychologist is a scientist who studies the mind. Unless specified, you should assume the
psychologist studies the human mind â€” as opposed to, for example, a pet psychologist.

A psychologist can be a researcher, who makes abstract studies of mental disorders and their
treatments. Or, a psychologist can be licensed to see and treat patients, offering therapy for
mental conditions or behavioral issues. The word comes from two Latin root, psyche, meaning soul,
mind, and spirit, and logia, meaning the study of. Unlike a psychiatrist, a psychologist does not
have a medical degree, and therefore cannot prescribe medication.
