Immolate is a verb that means to destroy something or someone, usually using fire, as a sacrifice to
a higher cause.  Do not try this at home.

To protest the Vietnam War, some Buddhist monks would pour gasoline on their body, light a match,
and immolate themselves, hoping that their fiery death would bring attention to the horror of war.
The word comes from the Latin immolare, which means â&euro;&oelig;sprinkled with sacrificial
meal,â&euro;? in reference to rituals where wheat grain would be sprinkled on the heads of human
sacrifices. Immolation is a powerful statement, but talking it out is always a safer and less
depressing option.
