If someone tells you to cut out the buffoonery, you may want to consider taking the French fries out
of your nostrils. Buffoonery means acting like a clown.

Notice how buffoon sounds like puff?  Well, they're related.  Buffare is an Italian word meaning
puff out the cheeks, which is apparently something that Italian court jesters, or buffoons, liked to
do in the 1700s. Guess you had to be there.
