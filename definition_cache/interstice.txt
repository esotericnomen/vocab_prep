Use the noun interstice to mean a tiny gap, like the interstice between your curtains which lets in
a thin slice of morning sunlight.

An interstice in the clouds might reveal blue sky, and an interstice in your kitchen wall could
account for the mouse problem you've had lately. Though interstice is useful for talking about these
narrow spaces or openings between things, it's much more commonly used in its plural form. For
example, you might complain that in the interstices of your busy day you have to catch up on
returning phone calls. The Latin root is interstitium, which literally means space between.
