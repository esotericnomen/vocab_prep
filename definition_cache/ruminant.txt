Use the word ruminant for any cud-chewing animal, like a cow or a camel.

A ruminant is a mammal with hooves and a complicated system of stomach compartments whose digestion
works by chewing partly digested food a second time in order to soften it. Cows, moose, giraffes,
and goats are all ruminants. The Latin meaning of ruminant is literally chewing over again or
chewing the cud. A similar word is ruminate, which comes from the same root and means think deeply
about something.
