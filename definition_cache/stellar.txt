Meaning outstanding, wonderful, better than everything else, stellar is a word of praise or
excitement. Thomas Edison invented many things, but his stellar achievement might have been the
light bulb.

Stellar literally means like a star. When it comes time for your debut on Broadway, you will sure
hope that the reviews say that you delivered a stellar performance. You could also use stellar to
talk about actual stars, of course, or you could even blend the two: enjoy the stellar beauty of
your beloved under the stellar light of a moonless night.
