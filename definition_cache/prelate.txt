A prelate is a high-ranking member of the clergy, such as a cardinal, abbot, or bishop, who has
authority over lesser clergy. Both Catholic and Protestant religions have prelates in their ranks.

The source of prelate is he Latin adjective praelatus, noble, whose meaning is appropriate to the
modern meaning, a high-level church dignitary. The word was applied to those high-ranking clergymen
around the beginning of the 13th century, the Middle English coming from the Middle French prelat.
As the church's importance increased, so did the importance implied by the word prelate. Ambrose
Bierce referred to a prelate as one of Heaven's aristocracy.
