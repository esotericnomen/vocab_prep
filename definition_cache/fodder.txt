Fodder is cheap food, usually given to livestock animals like cows. If you gave a cow caviar or
homemade scones, that would not be fodder. Try cornstalks.

Fodder is not just used to describe cattle feed. We use the word to talk about other kinds of
feeding that don't involve actual food. A new celebrity marriage is fodder for gossip magazines. In
war, the soldiers most likely to be killed, are called cannon fodder, from the times when armies
used canons instead of drone aircraft dropping missiles.
