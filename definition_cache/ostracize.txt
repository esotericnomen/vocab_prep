If you banish someone or ignore him, you ostracize him. When the Iranian president claimed that the
Holocaust was a hoax, he was ostracized by the international community.

Ostraka is an ancient Greek word for pottery shard.  Thousands of years ago, in the Greek city of
Athens, there was a public process where you would write the name of someone you wanted to kick out
of town on a broken ceramic fragment.  If enough Athenians wrote the same name, that person was sent
away for ten years. This process was called an ostracism.
