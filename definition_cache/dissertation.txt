A dissertation is a long piece of writing that uses research to bring to light an original idea.
Don't go to grad school unless you're prepared to write, say, a 300-page dissertation on some topic.

In everyday speech, we sometimes accuse people of delivering dissertations when they overload us
with dull information.  If you're annoyed with a long memo from your office manager about keeping
the kitchen clean, you could mutter to a coworker, “How’d you like that dissertation Felix
posted about rinsing out our mugs?”
