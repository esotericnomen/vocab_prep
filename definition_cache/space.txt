Before hiring a moving company to bring a grand piano into your studio apartment, you should measure
how much space you actually have available.

Space, along with time, is one of the basic concepts of reality, but there are plenty of non-
philosophical ways to use it. Don't let your dog sleep in the bed Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; she'll take up too
much space. There's a space between each of these words. If you're into rockets, you probably want
to travel in space, beyond the earth's atmosphere. A space in your day is free time. (Weird, right?)
The root word spatium means area covered in Latin.
