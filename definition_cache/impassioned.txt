If something is impassioned it's filled with or demonstrating intense emotion. Anything can be
impassioned â€” speech, a play, a conversation, a novel, or even you.

Impassioned comes from the Latin word passionem, meaning suffering or enduring, and originally
referred to the suffering of Christ on the cross, known as The Passion. In other words, impassioned
had a sense of trauma and anguish associated with it and only later did it come to describe happier
feelings as well. Whatever the emotional feeling behind impassioned, it's still a word that suggests
profound feeling and sincerity on behalf of the user.
