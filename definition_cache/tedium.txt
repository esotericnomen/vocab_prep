You can call the state of being really bored while doing something repetitive, tedium. You may
loathe the tedium of eating dinner with the family — after all, what is more boring than talking
to mom and dad, especially if you could be texting friends?

The noun tedium comes from the Latin root word taedere, meaning to weary of, and that's still what
tedium means today: bored and weary of it all. The noun can also mean a tedious period of time —
school concerts and assemblies are always two hours of tedium. Tedious is a related adjective form
of the word. In order to relieve the tedium of homework, you should pick less tedious tasks, try
fencing or painting to add some excitement to the day.
