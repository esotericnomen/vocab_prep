If no one is dancing at your party, you probably want to put on some music with a faster tempo —
meaning a faster speed.

The word tempo came into English by way of Italian, tracing all the way back to the Latin word
tempus, meaning time. It was originally used to describe the timing of music, or the speed at which
a piece of music is played. For example, a soothing song would be described as a slow tempo song.
Tempo is still used in this way to describe music, but you’ll also hear it used to refer to pace
or speed in general, as in — the increased tempo at the end of a close basketball game or the slow
tempo of action in a novel.
