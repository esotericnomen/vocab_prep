A grocery store with a large selection of fruits and vegetables could be said to have a cornucopia
of produce. A cornucopia is a lot of good stuff.

Around Thanksgiving in the United States, you'll often see cornucopias or horn-shaped baskets filled
with fruit and other goodies as centerpieces. Originally, a cornucopia was a goat's horn filled with
corn and fruit to symbolize plenty. Nowadays, a cornucopia is probably made of some kind of plaster
or wicker, but it still symbolizes the same thing Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; a good harvest season.
