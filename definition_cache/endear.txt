Things that endear you to others — like your sense of humor or your skill at baking chocolate chip
cookies — cause them to be fond of you.

The verb endear is almost always followed by the word to, as in the sentence The teacher's ready
smile and gentle voice endear him to the class of kindergartners. When something endears you to
another person, he or she adores you. In the 1500s, endear meant increase the value of, though it
quickly came to mean make dear, or perhaps to increase the emotional value, especially of another
person.
