Dispassionate describes someone who is not getting carried away by—or maybe not even
having—feelings. It's something you'd want to see in a surgeon, who keeps cool under pressure, but
not in a romantic partner.

Dispassionate is the opposite of passionate, and while passions are said to run hot, dispassionate
people are often described as cold. A city marshal whose job is it to evict people behind on their
rents must conduct their job with dispassionate fairness, but still, no one wants to be their
friend.
