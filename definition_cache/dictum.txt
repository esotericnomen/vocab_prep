You are what you eat is a dictum, and so is a law requiring you to curb your dog. A dictum is a
formal pronouncement, a rule, or a statement that expresses a truth universally acknowledged.

Dictum dates from the 16th Century. It descended from a Latin word that means something said. In
contemporary use, it means more like something that is officially said. If the principal of your
school issues a dictum declaring no jeans in school, it's time to go shopping.
