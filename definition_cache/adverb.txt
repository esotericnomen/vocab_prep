An adverb is a word that modifies anything other than a noun, usually a verb. If you listen
patiently to my grammar lesson, you will learn that patiently is an adverb in this sentence.

Many adverbs end in Ã¢&euro;&ldquo;ly, like quickly, happily, or grudgingly. Sometimes adverbs are
harder to spot. If I ask you to talk very loudly, then very is the adverb: it describes how you are
supposed to talk.
