The preposition except means excluding. When we refer to the continental United States, we mean the
whole country except Alaska and Hawaii.

This word can also be used as a conjunction meaning but: If you're not very hungry, you might not
eat anything, except a few crackers. As a verb, except is often used in the past tense: All drivers
must obey the speed limit, but ambulances rushing to the hospital are excepted. Much more rare is
the use of except as a verb meaning to object, which we find mostly in legal contexts.
