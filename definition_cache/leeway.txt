Leeway is a term used to describe the amount of freedom available. If you know you have a paper due
on Monday, you might ask your teachers if there is any leeway––could you, say, bring it first
thing Tuesday morning?

Leeway is a nautical term, referring to a vessel's drift to the lee, (nautical for downwind). Now,
it is very useful in describing those gray areas in life––for example, everyone has a ten-minute
leeway when meeting friends where you're not officially late, even if you're not actually on time.
