A coquette is a flirt, a girl or woman who knows how to flatter and manipulate men with her charms
in order to get what she wants.

Coquette sounds French, and it is, borrowed into English from French in the mid-17th century. It's
the feminine diminutive form of coq, which means cock, a male bird Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; so coquette
refers to a little female bird, and, in fact, it's also the name of a kind of colorful hummingbird
found in Latin America. If you imagine a coquette as a flamboyant little bird flitting about and
teasing the male birds, you'll have a good picture of a coquette.
