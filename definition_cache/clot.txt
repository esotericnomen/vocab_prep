A clot is a mass of coagulated blood. It's your body's way of repairing itself, stopping blood from
flowing and beginning to heal a wound.

You can use the noun clot for any liquid that forms a solid lump or mass, though it's usually a
medical term specifically related to blood. Some clots are useful, like the ones that form on skin
that's been cut, while others â&euro;&rdquo; like those that occur inside blood vessels
â&euro;&rdquo; can be harmful. Clot can also be a verb, meaning to clog or coagulate. The root is
the German word Klotz, which means lump or block.
