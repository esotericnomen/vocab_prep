A fancy word for a dining hall, or a place for communal meals, is a refectory. It is usually used to
describe a dining hall in a religious institution, like where monks eat together.

The word refectory comes from the Latin word reficere which means to restore, renew. A meal together
is a great way of restoring unity to a group. Nothing renews community like a great dinner, and the
conversation that occurs around it. Lunch in your school's refectory? Maybe not so much.
