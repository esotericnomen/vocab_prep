It could be your wine portfolio, your stake in a mining company, or even the extra coats that are
taking up space in your closet. Whatever it is, when you divest something, you get rid of it.

Divest is sort of a fancy way to say “dispose of.” It’s often used in a business context to
describe companies or governments that divest some of their holdings by selling them off. It can
also be used in the sense of taking something away from someone. For example if your boss becomes
insane and power mad, his handlers may divest him of his title, meaning his position is taken away
from him.
