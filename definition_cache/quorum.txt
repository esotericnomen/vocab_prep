A quorum is not necessarily a majority of members of a group, but the minimum needed in order to
conduct business. For example, if two members of a group are absent, there can still be a quorum,
meaning the meeting can go on without them.

The noun quorum is plural of qui in Latin, meaning of whom. The first quorum was an eminent group of
justices of the peace. The word quorum was used in the commission papers that gave them the
authority to act. Over time the current meaning, the minimum number needed to conduct business, was
added, but the word still retains the meaning of a select group, as well.
