When a bird or a cat preens, it smooths its feathers or cleans its fur. When you preen, you primp
and pay careful attention to how you're dressed and groomed, as if you're inviting the whole world
to watch you.

You can also preen just by puffing yourself up and congratulating yourself for something. You've
just landed your triple flip on the ski jump, and, as you swoosh to a stop at the foot of the hill
and take off your skis, you preen as you make your way through the adoring crowd.
