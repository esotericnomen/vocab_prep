High on drama and lacking any emotional restraint, overwrought is an adjective that means deeply,
excessively agitated or nervous.

Say your favorite soap star gets killed off in episode 12. If you sob uncontrollably, tear at your
hair, and refuse to leave the couch for a week, most would say your response was overwrought
Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; in other words, a bit much. But it's not just emotions that can go over the top. The
gaudy, golden McMansion covered in ornate Italian statuary where your soap star lives in real life?
Totally overdone, or overwrought, with details.
