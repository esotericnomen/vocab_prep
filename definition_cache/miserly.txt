Miserly people are stingy with their money and not likely to be generous, like Ebenezer Scrooge
himself.

The adjective miserly evolved from the Latin word miser, which means “unhappy, wretched.”
Nowadays, it's generally used to describe someone who hoards their money and presumably miserable
because of it. But be careful not to mix up the word miserly with misery — even though it can
often be the unfortunate mental outcome of interacting with a miserly individual.
