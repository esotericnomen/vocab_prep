The flora of a particular area consists of its plant species, considered as a whole. The word also
refers to the plant life of a particular era — for example, fossilized plants can help us
determine the flora at the time of dinosaurs.

The use of the word flora as referring to a particular area's vegetation has been used by botanists
since the 1640s, but it became common with Swedish botanist Linnaeus, who in 1745 wrote Flora
Suecica, a study of the plant life of Sweden. The word was a natural fit, as Flōra was the name of
the Roman goddess of flowers. When scientists study a region's flora, they classify their findings
and create a descriptive list, which is also called a flora.
