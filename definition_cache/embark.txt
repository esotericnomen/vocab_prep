When you embark on something, you are starting it â€” and it's exciting. You might embark on a new
career or embark on a trip to the Galapagos Islands. You wouldn't embark on a trip to the grocery
store.

The verb embark can be used specifically to refer to boarding a ship for a journey. When used for
general travel, the verb embark often implies a longer journey: She embarked on a trip around the
world. Besides, physical journeys, embark can be used to mean to start other kinds of journeys as
well. You might embark on a spiritual journey or embark on the path to enlightenment. Pack well.
