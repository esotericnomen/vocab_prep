An ejaculation is either the discharge of semen that happens when a man has an orgasm or a suddent
verbal outburst like Hey!

Ejaculations are sudden and explosive. One type of ejaculation is the male orgasm, when semen is
propelled from the penis. The other type of ejaculation is verbal. Stop! and Wow! are examples of
ejaculations. People make ejaculations when they're excited or have something important to say.
Ejaculations are also called interjections. They often interrupt, and they're usually full of
emotion. Duh, yikes, holy cow, and d'oh (as in Homer Simpson's D'OH!) are all ejaculations.
