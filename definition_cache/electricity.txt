Electricity is the energy that powers your lights and appliances. Electricity is the stuff that
Benjamin Franklin harnessed from lightning using a key and a kite. Don't try that on your own.

The word electricity comes from the Greek electron, which doesn't mean what you might expect. It
means amber, that yellow or reddish brown stone used for jewelry. The ancients noticed that when you
rub amber, it gets an electrostatic charge and will pick up light things like feathers and straw.
You can also describe other kinds of energy as electricity -- when you're really crazy about
someone, you can say there's electricity between the two of you.
