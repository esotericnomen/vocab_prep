The adjective amusing describes someone or something that makes you laugh. Something that you find
amusing, like your favorite stand up comic, might be less amusing to your easily offended
grandmother.

A pastime that's enjoyably diverting can also be described as amusing, like playing board games on a
rainy day. Amusing comes from the verb amuse, which is itself from the Middle French word amuser.
Interestingly, amuser meant to stare at stupidly, and the English word originally meant to deceive
by distraction. The more benign funny and enjoyable meanings didn't arise until much later, but they
eventually made the original meaning obsolete.
