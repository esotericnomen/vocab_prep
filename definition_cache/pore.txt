That trickle of sweat didn't just miraculously appear â€” it was secreted out of a pore, a really
tiny opening on the surface of your skin.

When used as a noun, pore means any tiny hole or opening that allows the passage of liquid. In
humans, pores are the little holes that bring us such pleasures as armpit sweat and, when clogged,
pimples. But when used as a verb, to pore means to concentrate your attention on or devote hours of
focus to something: like poring over the overwhelming choices in the antiperspirant aisle.
