Jumbo shrimp? Open secret? Use oxymoron to refer to a word or phrase that contradicts itself,
usually to create some rhetorical effect.

When Shakespeare's Juliet says, Parting is such sweet sorrow, she is using an oxymoron; her
apparently self-contradictory turn of phrase actually makes a neat kind of sense. Oxymoron is
sometimes used to describe a word combination that strikes the listener as humorously contradictory,
even if the speaker didn't intend it that way -- perhaps the most famous example is military
intelligence. The word oxymoron is itself an oxymoron; in Greek, oxy- means sharp or wise, while
moros means foolish.
