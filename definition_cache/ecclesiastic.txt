If you’re an ecclesiastic, you probably spend a lot of time in church. The word ecclesiastic
describes a member of the clergy, typically someone associated with a Christian church.

The word ecclesiastic has origins in the Greek word ekklesiastes, meaning speaker in an assembly or
church, and can be used to describe someone associated with a church, such as a cleric or a priest.
When you see an English word that begins with the eccles bit, you can be pretty sure that its
meaning will somehow involve religious matters. That’s because ekklēsia is the Greek word for
church and it has influenced the spelling of many English words of a religious nature, such as
ecclesial, ecclesiolatry, and ecclesiarch.
