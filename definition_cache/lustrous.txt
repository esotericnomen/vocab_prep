In shampoo commercials, the hair you see swinging is lustrous. It is brilliant, in the shiny sense.

Lustrous has its root in the Latin lustrare which means to illuminate or shine light over. When
something is lustrous, it reflects light in a glossy and shiny way. A bright smile and a glowing
reputation are both lustrous. If someone has a long and successful work history, you might say their
career is illustrious, meaning it has been lustrous for a long time.
