When you go on a nature walk in a school setting, you teacher might tell you to observe the flora
and fauna in the woods. Flora is plant life; fauna refers to animals.

Fauna derives from the name of a Roman goddess, but the handiest way to remember flora and fauna is
that flora sounds like flowers, which are part of the plant world, and fauna sounds like fawn, and
fawns are part of the animal kingdom.
