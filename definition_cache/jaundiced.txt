So you wake up in the morning and look in the mirror. To your surprise, and horror, instead of your
usual rosy complexion, your skin is yellow and the whites of your eyes are yellow, too! You, my
friend, are jaundiced.

Jaundice is from the Greek, ikteros, which referred to both the disease and a rare, yellow bird. It
was thought that someone with jaundice could stare at this yellow bird, and the jaundice would be
magically transferred to the bird. Jaundiced can also refer to ideas or feelings being distorted by
negative views or qualities, since yellow has been associated with bitterness and envy. Too bad
there is no bird to get rid of that!
