An organization wishing to advertise its products or services will often create a brochure, a small
booklet or folded paper giving brief details about what it's selling. It usually includes
illustrations and is made to be eye-catching and easily read.

Small booklets or pamphlets used to be stitched together, and from that stitching we get the word
brochure, which comes from the French verb brocher, to stitch, and thus means literally a stitched
work. The word enters English in the mid-18th century. Today brochures of many pages are usually
stapled. A common style of brochure is a single sheet, often folded in thirds to make it the right
size to fit inside an envelope.
