To seduce is to lure or entice, particularly away from obligations or proper behavior. Often,
seducing leads to sex.

Seduce means something close to attract, beguile, tempt, and mislead: a beautiful woman could seduce
a dude, and a clever criminal could seduce the same dude into a life of crime. A gorgeous day could
seduce you from doing your homework. When you're being seduced, it implies you're being tricked a
little bit, often into something that's enticing but not so good. The word is used in a famous line
from The Graduate: “Mrs. Robinson, you’re trying to seduce me.”
