To trample is to forcefully walk right over something or someone. If you fall down during a
footrace, another runner might trample you.

When you trample, you're stomping or stamping: it's the opposite of walking on tippy toes. A dog
might trample a flower garden while chasing a ball, and an angry child might deliberately trample
her sister's sandcastle, flattening it with her feet. The verb trample comes from tramp, walk
heavily or stamp, which is rooted in the Middle Low German word trampen, to tramp, stamp, or press
upon.
