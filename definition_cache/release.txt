To release something or someone is to set it free, like a caged animal or a prisoner.  “I shall be
released” is a famous refrain from a 1967 Bob Dylan song that has come to symbolize political
freedom around the world.

Release, which is a noun and a verb, has many different meanings.  As a noun, it can mean a
liberation, an unfastening, or the condition of being made available, like a movie or a CD.  “When
is the new Spiderman movie being released?” you might ask your best friend.  As a verb, it can
mean to relieve of suffering or obligation, like a debt.  But it can also mean to lay off from a
job, or surrender.  “Release me from having to watch this terrible movie!” you could end up
saying about the 16th Spiderman sequel.  And who would blame you?
