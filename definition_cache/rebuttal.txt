When two people debate, one of them makes an argument, and the other follows with a rebuttal, which,
plainly put, is the no, you're wrong and this is why argument.

We often associate rebuttals with arguments made in the courtroom or public debates that occur
around election time, but the word can really apply to any situation in which an argument is put
forth and someone disagrees, and explains why. Sports fans, for instance, like to argue about the
likely winner of an upcoming game and when you make a case for why your friend is wrong, you are
offering a rebuttal of his argument.
