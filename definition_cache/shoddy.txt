Shoddy refers to poor materials or quality. Maybe you passed on buying a house because it leaned in
an odd way and various and sundry parts were falling off. Sounds like both the materials and
workmanship were shoddy.

Shoddy originally referred to something that looked high-quality but wasn√¢&euro;&trade;t. Later, a
certain type of cloth made with leftover pieces and rags was called a shoddy. While shoddy often
refers to materials or workmanship, questionable ethics can also be referred to as shoddy, as in the
shoddy principles of a slumlord or the shoddy morals of someone who steals from their friends.
