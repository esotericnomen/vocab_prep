Use the word deadpan to describe someone who uses no expression when speaking, such as the deadpan
way some comedians deliver even their funniest jokes — which can make them even funnier.

Deadpan dates to 1928, when pan was slang for face. So if you seem to have a dead face as you say
something, it means your face looks very blank — no energy or animation. Deadpan is associated
with sarcasm, and like sarcasm, if you use it for comic effect, there's a risk your audience won't
pick up on it. Nevertheless, deadpan humor can be funny and popular — witness the success of
deadpan humor in the sitcom Seinfeld.
