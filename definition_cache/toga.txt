A toga is the draped, dress-like garment worn by men in ancient Rome. Today, businessmen wear suits
and ties, but thousands of years ago, the business suit of Rome was a toga.

The toga party is practically a rite of passage in college. What could be more fun than dressing in
a drapy, one-piece, off-the-shoulder tunic like they did in ancient Rome, while chugging beer and
acting like an idiot. Frankly, it's hard to understand what the toga adds to the party. Is it more
fun to get drunk in a weird, ancient half-dress than it is to get drunk in your own pants and shirt?
The statue of Julius Caesar shows him wearing his toga, but much of it is hidden under his armored
chest-plate.
