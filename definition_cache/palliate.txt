When you palliate something, you try to make something less bad: “City leaders tried to palliate
effects of the trash haulers' strike by distributing extra large garbage cans with tight-fitting
lids.”

Palliate is the word to use when you want to make something feel or seem better. Palliate doesn’t
mean “cure” or “solve.” Instead, something that palliates relieves the symptoms or
consequences of something, without addressing the underlying cause. Your dentist might give you
pain-killing drugs to palliate the discomfort caused by an impacted molar, but that molar is still
there, waiting to cause more trouble.
