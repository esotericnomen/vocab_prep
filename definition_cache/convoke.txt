To convoke is to call to a meeting, specifically one that is formal. There is no fun to be had when
you're convoked; there is serious business to attend to.

Convoke emerged in the 14th century, from the Latin word  convocare Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; to call
together; the definition stands today unchanged. Use convoke when you are speaking of people or a
group being summoned for an official gathering, like the kind the government or a large organization
holds.
