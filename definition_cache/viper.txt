A viper is a certain type of poisonous snake. The most common vipers in the United States are
rattlesnakes and water moccasins.

Vipers are found in most places on earth, although some of the most famous poisonous snakes in the
world, for example the cobra, are not vipers. Although viper is a scientific name for a particular
family of snakes who poison others by biting them with hollow fangs that inject venom, it is often
used generally to describe a spiteful, disloyal or back-stabbing person.
