Fusion is the process of combining two or more things together into one. If your favorite genres are
Westerns and reality dating shows, maybe when you become a TV executive, you'll create a fusion of
the two, where competing dates have shoot-outs in saloons.

The noun fusion comes from the Latin word fundere, meaning melt, so fusion is the act of melting
things together.  In science, fusion is the process of merging atoms together to create energy.

ways of cooking. Fusion music is usually the combination of jazz and rock.
