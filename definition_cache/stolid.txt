A stolid person can’t be moved to smile or show much sign of life, in much the same way as
something solid, like a giant boulder, is immovable. Both are expressionless.

It's hard to get excited about the word stolid. It refers to emotionless people or things, and it
even sounds pretty dull. Your face may be stolid, as you plod through the unemotional history of the
word born in the 17th century of little more than Latin words for foolish. In some definitions,
stolid does have more complimentary synonyms, such as dependable or calm, but these can be
overshadowed by other words for stolid — empty, blank, and vacant, to name a few.
