Right is a direction, the opposite of left. Most people are right-handed. Right is also correct: the
opposite of wrong.

Many times this word has something to do with what is good, proper, or correct, like the right thing
to do. You can get the right answer to a question. You can be morally correct or in the right. You
can right a wrong by making up for an injustice. People have rights: in this country, we are
guaranteed life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. The first 10 Amendments to our Constitution
are called the Bill of Rights.
