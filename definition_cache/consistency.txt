Foods like puddings and gravies need to be the correct consistency — that is, the right thickness
or texture — for the dish. It would not be good, for example, for gravy to have the consistency of
cottage cheese.

The noun consistency also refers to uniformity or compatibility between things or parts. For
example, you might need to check the consistency of spelling in a document or the consistency among
eye-witness accounts of a crime. Consistency usually implies a positive sense of dependability. If
you show consistency at the work place, your manager can depend on you.
