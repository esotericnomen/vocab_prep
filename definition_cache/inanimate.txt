Inanimate describes a non-living thing. Chairs, baseballs, sofa cushions and sadly, snowmen, are all
inanimate objects.

We can break inanimate down into two Latin roots: in, which means “not,” and animatus, which
translates to “alive.” So inanimate means simply, not alive. That include things that are
recently dead, things that were never alive to begin with, and things that simply look dead: A bear
in hibernation may appear inanimate due to its decreased heart rate, but don’t be fooled —
it’s very much alive.
