If something vexes you, it brings you trouble or difficulty. In other words, it annoys, worries,
distresses, irritates, bothers, or puzzles you.

Vex can be used as an adjective: for example, a vexing issue is not easily solved. The verb vex, the
corresponding adjective vexatious, and the noun vexation are all slightly old-fashioned though still
in current use. Vex descends from Middle English vexen, from Middle French vexer, from Latin vexare
to shake, attack, trouble.
