When you ration your supplies, you dole them out a little at a time. A ration is also a wartime
military meal, or the portion of food that someone is allowed in times of scarcity.

A ration is the fixed portion of food or other goods allowed to each person in times of shortages.
In the military, a soldierâ&euro;&trade;s meal is called a ration, especially if itâ&euro;&trade;s
portable. As a verb, to ration something is to allow each person to have only a specific amount.
During times of war many things have been rationed: gas, rubber, luxury items, and food. If you are
diabetic you need to strictly ration your sugar intake.
