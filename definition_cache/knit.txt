If you decide to knit a sweater, you will need yarn, knitting needles, an instruction manual, and
lots of patience! Knitting involves different kinds of stitches or consecutive loops that you create
in rows.

The verb is derived from the Old English cnyttan, meaning “to tie with a knot, bind or fasten.”
While knitting can also be completed with a machine, many people knit hats, scarves, and mittens as
a hobby. Knit can also mean “entwine.” Two ideas or concepts can be knit together, and it could
be said that a marriage knits two people together. Note that the ‘k’ at the beginning is silent.
