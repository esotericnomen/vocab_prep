When you step in a glutinous substance, some of it will stick to your shoe and stretch as you step
up. Glutinous means glue-like, or thick and sticky.

The Latin word for glue was gluten, which now the name of a substance found in wheat. Gluten is what
makes pizza or bread dough stretchy and gooey, or glutinous. If you're baking a cake, you shouldn't
mix it too much or it could become glutinous, or tough. When someone is on a gluten-free diet, it
means they cannot eat wheat or other grains that contain gluten.
