If a party host wants to inebriate her guests, she'll serve them many alcoholic drinks. In other
words, she'll try to get them drunk.

Use the verb inebriate to describe what happens when someone or something intoxicates a person. If
you realize that your lemonade is inebriating you, you probably accidentally ordered an alcoholic
drink that tastes like lemonade. You can also use inebriate to describe something that's beautiful
or thrilling: There is nothing like watching the sun rise over the mountains to inebriate me. The
Latin root, inebriatus, simply means to make drunk.
