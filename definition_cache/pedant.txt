A pedant is an annoying person who is focused on minor details and book knowledge rather than
ordinary common sense. In war, it can be dangerous to have a pedant as commander––he'll insist
on textbook maneuvers instead of adapting to circumstances on the ground.

This word was borrowed from French pédant or Italian pedante teacher, schoolmaster, but its
ultimate origin is unknown. One theory is that the original meaning of Italian pedante was foot
soldier, associated with the Italian word pedagogo teacher because teachers are always on their
feet. Another theory is that Italian pedante was formed from the root of Greek paideuein to teach,
which happens to be the source of English pedagogue teacher. In fact, a pedagogue is a pedantic
teacher.
