Septic is connected to dangerous waste products. If your house is not connected to your town or
city's sewer, your waste from drains and toilets goes into a septic tank.

Derived from a Greek word meaning rotten, septic can indicate that something is infected. When a
hospital patient goes into septic shock, it means that their body, wracked by an infection, is
starting to fail. People in septic shock are victims of a condition called sepsis.
