If you are glee club treasurer, and you pocket twenty glee dollars saying you used it to buy
lozenges, you are committing embezzlement, the theft of money or property that you officially
manage.

In order for stealing to be embezzlement, you need to both be in charge of the funds or property you
are stealing, and you need to conceal your theft. Because of this, it is classified as a type of
fraud. People who commit embezzlement often create fake paper trails â&euro;&rdquo; receipts,
canceled checks, false signatures â&euro;&rdquo; to hide their crime.
