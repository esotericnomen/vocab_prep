A functionary is someone who fills a specific role in a political party or some other organization.
We tend to picture them as people in gray suits who follow the boss's orders and don't think for
themselves.

The origins of this word go back to the French Revolution, and specifically Napoleon. After
conquering most of Europe, Napoleon needed lots of people to help carry out all the functions, or
duties, of his huge, centralized state. To build an empire you need soldiers; to run an empire you
need office workers. These desk knights, if you will, were called fonctionnaires.
