Use the noun desuetude to say that something is not active or not being used, like the desuetude of
a neglected park, with its overgrown ballfields and broken playground equipment.

There are two ways to correctly pronounce desuetude: DES-wuh-tude or de-SUE-uh-tude. It comes from
Latin: de- means away, from and suescere means become accustomed. So if people or things are not
used -- out of custom -- desuetude is the result, carrying with it a sense of neglect, disrepair,
and inaction.
