If your boss catches you sleeping with your head on your desk, she's likely to comment on your
indolence. Indolence is another word for laziness.

The noun indolence means a habit of laziness, especially when avoiding work. In the 1600s, indolence
was mostly used to mean insensitivity to pain, from the Latin indolentia, freedom from pain. About
100 years later, indolence came to have its current meaning, possibly because of the phrase taking
pains, which means being careful. If you are so careful that you never leave the house, people might
think of you as lazy.
