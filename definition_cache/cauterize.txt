To cauterize is to seal off a wound or incision by burning it or freezing it, usually a hot iron,
electricity, or chemicals. Metaphorically, it means to make less sensitive to feelings and emotions.

Cauterize is usually a medical term. In surgery, using an electrical tool to cauterize the incision
seals off blood vessels, resulting in a cleaner operation that heals more easily. Extreme cold,
electricity, and chemicals are also used outside the body cauterize, or burn off, warts and vessels
