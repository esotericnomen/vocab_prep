If you went backpacking through Europe last summer, you could call your travels a peregrination. A
peregrination is a long journey or period of wandering.

Peregrination comes from the Latin peregrinari, which means “to travel abroad.” A peregrination
is a journey or pilgrimage, especially one that's made on foot. This word typically applies to
traveling for an extended period of time or over a great distance. So, you wouldn’t call a trip to
the grocery store a peregrination. However, if you traveled the globe looking for the world’s best
grocery store, you could call that a peregrination.
