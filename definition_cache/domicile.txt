Domicile is a fancy word for the place where you live. Whether it's a mansion on 5th Avenue or a
tee-pee in the desert, if you live in it, it's your domicile.

Do you live somewhere? Such as in a house, on a houseboat, or in an apartment? Then you have a
domicile, or simply, housing. Or in the eyes of the law, your legal place of residence. You can turn
domicile into a verb, and say that you are currently domiciled in the Caribbean Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; but
you'd really only use that terminology if you were on trial for tax evasion.
