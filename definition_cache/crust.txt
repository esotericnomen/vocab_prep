The crust is a hard layer that forms on the outside of something, like a loaf of bread. Little kids
often like their sandwiches with the crust cut off.

You’ve probably eaten lots of crusts —  bread crust, pie crust — any food that’s hard on the
outside and soft on the inside has a crust. Crust is also a verb  meaning “to form a hard outer
layer.” Crusting happens with more than just food, like when a layer of dirt crusts your clothes
after a romp in the mud. The Earth has a hard crust too. Little kids don’t like to eat that
either, usually.
