Use the adjective alimentary to describe food that is good for you, like an alimentary meal of
vegetable soup and whole-grain bread.

Alimentary comes from the Latin word alimentum which means nourishment. If something nourishes you,
it helps you thrive and even grow stronger. So, alimentary foods are those that offer good nutrition
to keep you going, like a bowl of oatmeal with walnuts and raisins. Not alimentary? A chocolate
donut Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; though it may be delicious.
