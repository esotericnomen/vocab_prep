If you're inclined to do something, you want to do it, you like doing it, and you may even have an
inherent talent for doing it. Alternatively, if the sidewalk outside your house is inclined, that
means it slopes upward.

Inclined means that you're likely to do something, you're leaning toward doing it, or you do it
habitually. If you're inclined to eat too much at Thanksgiving, you're not alone. If you're inclined
to want to join the Iditarod dog sled race, get a warm jacket. Inclined can also be an adjective
describing something that's at an angle. If a ramp is inclined, it's on a slant, sloping up toward
something else.
