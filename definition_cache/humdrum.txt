That class on 18th century feminist zoologists and their favorite poets? Surprisingly humdrum, or
dull, tedious, and totally boring.

Anything that you can call humdrum is so severely lacking in variety and excitement that it's sure
to make you hum and drum your fingers out of boredom. Humdrum is an adjective to describe the
unglamorous monotony of everyday routines. It's the same old thing, again and again, over and over.
Humdrum can also mean predictable, mind-numbing and not very challenging Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; hopefully
the complete opposite of your social life.
