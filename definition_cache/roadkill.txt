Roadkill means the dead body of an animal that's been hit by a car. Some people are so sensitive
they can't stand to look at roadkill.

Animals that die on a highway, usually because they've been struck by a vehicle, are roadkill. You
can also spell it as two words, road kill. The word is fairly modern, from the early 1970's, in part
because before cars were invented -- and before there were so many of them on the roads -- there
weren't so many animals affected by the transportation of humans. Use the term figuratively when
someone feels unwanted: I felt like roadkill when you didn't invite me.
