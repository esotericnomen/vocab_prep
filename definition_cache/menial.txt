A menial task is anything that takes very little training, skill, or talent. Some people find it
relaxing to do the menial chore of folding laundry.  Go figure.

The adjective menial comes from an Old French word, mensie, which means
â&euro;&oelig;household.â&euro;?  Many chores that get labeled as menial  are domestic, but other
jobs outside of the home are sometimes also considered menial: stuffing envelopes, data processing,
repetitive assembly line work, brain surgery (OK, that last one is not considered menial; we were
just checking to see if you were awake).
