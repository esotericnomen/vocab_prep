If you have been in a bad accident or have an addiction problem, you may go away for a stretch of
time to rehabilitate yourself or, in other words, bring yourself back to health.

Though we hear a lot about rehabilitation or rehab in the press in connection with drugs or alcohol,
the word rehabilitate has a lot of other meanings. You can rehabilitate a building's structure by
reinforcing it with steel beams, or rehabilitate your bad reputation by staying after school to help
clean up the grounds.
