As its sound might suggest, plaudit is indeed related to applaud and applause. In fact it's really
just a fancy way of saying praise or acclamation.

Plaudit is used more in a literary sense than in spoken English, and particularly applies to the
reception of a work of art, most notably a play. In fact, the word comes from the Latin plaudite,
loudly uttered by Roman actors at the end of a play and meaning applaud! Kind of like cue cards for
game show audiences now.
