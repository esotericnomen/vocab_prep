If you are quick, you move with speed. You may be a quick runner or a quick study — if you tend to
learn things quickly.

The adjective quick can also mean brief and fleeting — as in a quick visit or a quick trip to the
store. Quick also means without delay: You'll need to jot a quick reply to the party invitation. The
noun quick is a whole other story; it's a highly sensitive bit of skin, especially the skin under
the fingernails or toe nails. Be careful not to chew your nails down to the quick — especially
your toe nails.
