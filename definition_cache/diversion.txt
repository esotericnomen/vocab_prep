A diversion can be something that takes you off the course you are on, like a detour while you are
traveling, or a game of tennis that takes you away from the stress of work.

The noun diversion and the verb divert are related. Both have to do with a change of focus or
direction. When you want a break from something, many diversions are welcome, like a rousing game of
â&euro;&oelig;twenty questionsâ&euro;? on a long car ride. Conversely, some diversions are
unwelcome, like when the guy next to you is texting during your French midterm.
