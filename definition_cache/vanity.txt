Vanity is the quality of being vain, or having a ridiculous amount of pride. If you have excessive
vanity in your appearance, you probably spend long hours sitting at your vanity table doing your
makeup or plucking your nose hairs.

If you pride yourself on looking absolutely perfect and refuse to do any work that might dirty your
clothes or mess up your hair, someone might accuse you of vanity. Often vanity is empty, like the
emperor's in The Emperor's New Clothes. If someone pays to have her own book published even though
it's really bad, we say it is a vanity printing.
