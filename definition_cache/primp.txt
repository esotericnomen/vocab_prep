Primp is a word that is best illustrated by girls getting ready for a ball––it means to groom
yourself elaborately.

Primp is a word that was very popular in the 19th century. In Little Women and other novels by
Louisa May Alcott, girls waste much time primping, when they ought to be grooming their character
and thinking about their behavior instead.
