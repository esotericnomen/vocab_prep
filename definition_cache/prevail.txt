Prevail means to successfully persuade someone of something. If you were a Presidential advisor and
you convinced him to make a National Day of Pet Appreciation, then you prevailed upon him to
recognize pets.

Prevail can be used for different kinds of success. If you prevail upon someone, you have influence
on them. If you prevail over someone, you win. Say you’re a big fan of a losing team. You might
cheer, “Despite all odds, we will prevail!” To use prevail there has be some kind of contest.
That could be internal, like when you’re on a diet and your desire to eat chocolate cake prevails
over your discipline.
