The verb repine describes expressing gloom or discontent. Brooding, fretful, and sad â€” these are
the traits of people who repine at their circumstances in life.

Early American poet Anne Bradstreet used repine in her well-known poem, Upon the Burning of Our
House July 10th 1666, describing how the speaker got over the loss: And when I could no longer look,
/ I blest His grace that gave and took, / That laid my goods now in the dust. / Yea, so it was, and
so 'twas just. / It was his own; it was not mine. / Far be it that I should repine.
