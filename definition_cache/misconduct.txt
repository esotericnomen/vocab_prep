Misconduct is any kind of bad, unethical, or illegal activity. When there's misconduct, someone is
doing something wrong.

Since conduct is behavior, misconduct is behavior that's not quite right: some kind of shady or
criminal conduct. If an accountant cooked the books â&euro;&rdquo; lied about finances
â&euro;&rdquo; that's misconduct. A police officer taking a bribe is guilty of misconduct. Often,
misconduct specifically refers to someone who does improper things on behalf of someone else, like
the misconduct of a dishonest lawyer.
