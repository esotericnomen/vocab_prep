A boulevard is a type of street. You can get to school by taking the four-lane boulevard, but to
avoid all the traffic, you might use the less-traveled side streets.

A boulevard is a street or avenue, especially one that's very wide and lined with trees. Many
boulevards have a median strip of grass and sometimes trees. Boulevard strip is the regional term
for a patch of grass between a curb and a sidewalk, which in other places is called a tree lawn. The
French word boulevard literally means rampart, or defensive embankment. Later it was adapted to mean
a promenade beside a rampart.
