Caliber is a kind of measurement that can describe either the level of a personâ€™s ability or the
diameter of a gun barrel. Your dad might be a high-caliber marksman, especially when using his .22
caliber rifle.

Caliber describes the level of ability a person has achieved in a profession. For example, you
probably wouldn't want to hire a low-caliber plumber when the toilet breaks. The caliber of an
institution or a program describes the height of its standards. You might be planning to attend the
high-caliber veterinary program at your state university. Caliber is also the measurement of the
width inside a gun barrel, and its corresponding bullets.
