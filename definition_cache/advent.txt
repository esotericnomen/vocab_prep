The advent of something means that it's finally here. You might be waiting for the advent of a new
iPhone or for the advent of cloning. Don't hold your breath.

Generally, the noun advent is used for the introduction of something important. The twentieth
century saw the advent of many important inventions Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; including television, computers,
and microwave dinners. If the word is capitalized, it has a religious meaning, referring to the
period, observed in certain Christian religions, that begins on the fourth Sunday before Christmas
(December 25).
