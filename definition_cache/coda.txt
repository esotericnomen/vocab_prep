A coda is a concluding segment of a piece of music, a dance, or a statement. It's usually short and
adds a final embellishment beyond a natural ending point. Like this.

Coda comes from the Italian word couda, and it's good to think of it as a tail tacked onto something
that in and of itself is already a whole. If you tell a story about your crazy experience getting
lost in the country and sleeping at a farmer's house, you might add, as a coda, that the farmer
ended up visiting you too, a year later.
