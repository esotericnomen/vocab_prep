Disclose means to reveal or expose information that has previously been kept a secret â€” like a
politician might be forced to disclose his finances or former scandals while running for office.

When a politician, corporate executive, or celebrity announces that he or she has something to
disclose, the public listens. They know that the information they're about to hear was kept secret
for a reason. Something incriminating or juicy is about to be revealed, like a secret affair or
plummeting company profits.
