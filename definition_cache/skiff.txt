A skiff is a small boat. If you decide to purchase a skiff instead of giant yacht, you're probably
someone who prefers the quiet, simple life. (Or maybe you just didnâ€™t want to spend the money on a
yacht.)

A skiff may be powered by oars, sails, or a motor, but in any of these cases, a typical skiff can
carry only a few passengers. Skiff originally referred to a small boat attached to a large ship; the
skiff would have been used for communication with and transportation to other large ships and the
shore. Winslow Homer, a 19th-century American artist, often portrayed skiffs in his depictions of
marine scenes.
