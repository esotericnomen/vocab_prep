A vicar is a member of the clergy who is not high-ranking but is still considered a holy
representative of the church.

Vicars are set slightly below the official head of a congregation or parish, sometimes acting as an
agent or substitute clergyman. Originally considered an earthly go-between for man and God, the
meaning of the word moved diminished as the vicar became sort of a deputy priest or parson. You can
find a vicar in the Church of England, and also in the Episcopal and Roman Catholic churches.
Consider that vicarious means something taking another's place Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; that's what a vicar
does.
