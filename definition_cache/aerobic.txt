When you run for a mile, and start breathing hard, get your blood pounding and your heart rate up,
you are doing aerobic exercise: exercise that depends on and consumes oxygen.

We are aerobic creatures because we breathe air in order to live, and aerobic describes anything
that uses oxygen to survive. Most of the time, this word is connected to exercise: activity that
increases the rate at which your body uses oxygen. There is an entire exercising industry -- quite
the craze in the 80s -- known simply as aerobics. Aerobics consists of dance moves and jumping
exercises designed to get your blood flowing and your heart rate up.
