A pariah is someone that has been soundly rejected by their community. Your constant gossiping might
make you a pariah on campus.

Pariah takes its name from a tribe in Southeast India. The pariahs were drummers, sorcerers, and
servants who became untouchables in Indian society because of the unsanitary jobs they did. Pariah
maintains this sense of untouchableness. Pariahs are not just unliked, they are avoided at all
costs. Imagine how a once popular restaurant could gain pariah status if it fails health inspections
three times in a row.
