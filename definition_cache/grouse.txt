A grouse is a small game bird. But the verb to grouse is different. It means to gripe about how
unhappy you are. It's not recommended for most people, because grousing is unattractive.

People's excitement about the rise of the Internet has been largely replaced by disappointment that
it's turned out to be essentially a forum for people to grouse. No disappointment is too small to
grouse about on the Internet. Did you stub your toe? Grouse about it in your blog! Did your sister
tattletale? Get online and start grousing. I grouse, therefore I am, might be the motto of the
Internet. Oh well: now I'm grousing too.
