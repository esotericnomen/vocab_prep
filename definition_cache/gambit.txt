A gambit is a strategic move, often in chess but also in politics or business, where a player
sacrifices something up front for future gain.

The noun gambit comes from an Italian word, gambetto, which means “tripping up.” When you make
an opening move, offer something, or start a conversation with something that seems self-sacrificing
but is really a ploy for greater advantage in the long run, that's a gambit. In chess, a gambit is
when you sacrifice a pawn early for better positioning, but when you offer to drive the morning
carpool that’s might be a gambit to get the afternoon shift off.
