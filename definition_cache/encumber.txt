To encumber is to weigh someone or something down with a physical or psychological burden. You may
find yourself encumbered by a heavy backpack or with anxieties. Either way, it's a heavy load to
bear!

by your homework load you canâ&euro;&trade;t go to the concert Saturday night. The root, cumber,
has several shades of meaning â&euro;&rdquo; including to burden and to be overwhelmed.
