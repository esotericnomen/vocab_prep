Truly, your resilience, or ability to bounce back, is not just admirable, but foolhardy, some might
say; who else could have survived an attack by a rabid toucan and then gone on to become a world-
renowned bird breeder?

The noun resilience stems from the Latin resiliens “to rebound, recoil.” As a character trait,
resilience is a person’s ability to recover quickly from unfortunate circumstances or illness.
Runners who fall during a marathon only to pop back up and dash through the finish line show some
serious resilience. Or Silly Putty that can stretch and stretch without breaking, and then come back
to rest inside its egg-shaped carrying case — that’s resilience, or elasticity, for you.
