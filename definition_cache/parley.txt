A formal discussion between enemies or opponents is called a parley. A British drummer called for a
parley between the British and American armies in 1781, and officers from both sides then discussed
the terms of Britain's surrender.

Parley can also be used as a verb, meaning to discuss or negotiate, such as between enemies or
opponents. If your siblings are fighting, you may need to encourage them to parley in another room
in order to discuss their differences and hopefully settle the problem once and for all.
