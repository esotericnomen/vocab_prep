Look closely at that branch or leaf — you might be able to spot a chameleon hiding. These little
lizards are able to change color and adapt to their backgrounds, blending in to hide from predators.

The history of the word chameleon goes back to the Greek word khamaileōn, which meant lion on the
ground, maybe because of the creature’s somewhat scary face, or maybe because the ridge around the
creature’s head looks something like a lion’s mane. In Old French it became chaméléon, which
stuck. Today there are two acceptable spellings, chameleon and chamaeleon. We often use the word
today to refer to a person who is changeable or inconsistent.
