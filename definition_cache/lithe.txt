Have you ever seen people who can bend so easily, they can touch their heels to the back of their
heads? That person is, in a word, lithe.

Lithe comes to us from Old English and originally meant mild, meek. As a meek person bends to the
will of others, the meaning of lithe has broadened to flexible and even graceful. Think of a dancer
or the ease of a sleek cat when you think of lithe. You can use it to describe a person or the way
someone moves.
