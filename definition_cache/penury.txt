Penury means extreme poverty to the point of homelessness and begging in the streets. Economic
downturns, job loss, shopping sprees, and weekends at the high rollers' table in Vegas can lead to
penury.

Penury comes from the Latin word penuria, which, though it sounds like something contagious,
actually means scarcity. It's not a word that turns up often in casual conversation or even on
nightly newscasts. You're more apt to spot it in a college textbook or maybe an editorial in The New
York Times.
