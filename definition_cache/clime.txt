Not to be confused with climb, a clime is a region known for its weather. In the dead of winter, we
dream about heading to sunny climes, where we can hang out in shorts.

The key to remembering clime is that it's so similar to climate, with which it shares the Greek root
klima, zone. So a clime is a zone that has a characteristic climate. Folks in colder climes think
nothing of the kind of snowfall that we down here in the south get all panicked about. But then
again, when they come here to our warmer clime, they forget to put on sunscreen; people from one
clime can learn a lot from a visit to a different clime.
