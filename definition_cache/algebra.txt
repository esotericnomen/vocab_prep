If the math equation you're doing has letters or other symbols that stand for numbers, you're likely
doing algebra. You probably took your first algebra class early in your high school years.

The noun algebra comes from Arabic word al jebr, meaning reunion of broken parts, which appeared in
the title of mathematician al-Khwarizmi's famous book on equations. In algebra you use basic
arithmetic like addition and subtraction, but the quantities you're working with are often unknown
-- that's why they're represented by letters. You might remember solving algebra equations that look
like this: a(b + c) = ab + ac. The letters a, b, and c all represent a number.
