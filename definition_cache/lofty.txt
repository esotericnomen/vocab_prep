Lofty is a good word for describing something that's high above the ground, or someone who acts like
she's high above everyone else.

mean physically high as well. A towering mountain can be called lofty. So can someone who walks
around with her nose in the air and speaks in a fake English accent. Even if she's only five-foot-
two.
