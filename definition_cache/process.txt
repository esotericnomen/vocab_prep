Some people love to have a process laid out for them, so they don't have to think about the steps
they need to follow to get something done. Some people love to talk about process––forever
planning out those steps without actually ever taking any.

You hear this word being used a lot to describe work. I am in the process of drafting a memo, even
if I kill myself with late nights in the process. The related word procession describes people or
vehicles moving forward in an orderly way––a wedding opens with the bridal procession.
