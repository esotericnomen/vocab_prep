If someone tells you not to be disheartened, they want you to stay upbeat and positive. Something
that brings you down or steals your sense of hope disheartens you.

Uncracking the code of the verb dishearten couldn't be easier. Just take it apart, and it quickly
reveals its meaning. Dis- is a prefix that means not, un-, take away. Heart in its figurative sense
means love, care, and good feelings. And the -en at the end shows the word is a verb with the sense
of causing something to be. So dishearten means to cause someone's 'heart' to be taken away. We were
disheartened by the news of still more home foreclosures.
