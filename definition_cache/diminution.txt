When you dim a light, you reduce the brightness coming from the bulb. Diminution (not actually
related to dim) is the lessening of something to a smaller size or lower status, as a diminution of
your superpowers when you wake up from a dream.

Pronouncing diminution (dim-ih-NYOO-shun) only seems to get harder the more you repeat it, but
memorizing the meaning and sounds with diminish and ammunition helps. If you take away the firepower
in a battle, for example, you diminish the ammunition, causing a diminution of the army's power. A
diminution is a decrease of size, time, or esteem. Does the word still sound funny? Let's try a
diminution, or reduction, of the number of times we say it Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; starting now.
