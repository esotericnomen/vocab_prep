If you emancipate someone, you set them free from something. At the end of the Civil War, slaves
were emancipated and became free men and women.

If you break down emancipate, you have e- out, -man- from the Latin manus hand, and -cip- from the
Latin verb to take. Put it together, and you have to be taken out of someone's hands Ã¢&euro;&rdquo;
a good definition of freedom. The American Revolution was about colonists emancipating themselves
from British rule. As a legal term, if a child is emancipated, he or she is declared independent
from parental control.
