An awl is a tool with a long, sharp end that makes it just the thing for punching extra holes in all
your leather belts when you lose weight.

It looks kind of like an ice pick, but an awl is a tool used by shoemakers, carpenters and other
craftsmen who need to punch small holes through leather or wood. If your shoes were made by hand,
chances are all those little holes where the laces go through were made with the use of an awl.
