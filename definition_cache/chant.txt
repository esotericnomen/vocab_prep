A chant is a type of song with a repetitive, monotonous structure. It’s also something sports fans
love to do. At the Olympics, some Americans chant, “USA! USA! USA!”

In addition to being something fans like to yell together, a chant is a traditional form in a lot of
religious music. There are Catholic chants, Hindu chants, Jewish chants, and the list goes on.
Because of this type of music, “to chant” means “to repeat something in a monotone or
repetitive way.” Chants have no harmony or instruments, only a simple rhythm and a lot of
repetition.
