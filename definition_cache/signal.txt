A signal is a gesture or message that people use to communicate with each other. The wave you give a
good friend to call her over from across the room and the impulse that transmits your voice through
the telephone to your mother are both signals.

In the course of a single day, you probably send and receive thousands of different signals. When
you want to cross the street, you wait for the green light â&euro;&rdquo; a signal that it's safe
to cross. If you're in a relationship and you're not sure whether you like the person you're dating,
you could be sending mixed signals â&euro;&rdquo; first acting like you're interested, and then
acting uninterested. If your date finally gets tired of your mixed signals while you're at a
restaurant, you'll need to signal to your server that it's time for the check.
