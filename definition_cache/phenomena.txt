A phenomenon is an extraordinary occurrence or circumstance. In the 1950s, rock-n-roll was
considered a new cultural phenomenon, while today we think of crop circles as a mysterious
phenomenon.

Like many words with Greek roots, phenomenon started out as a science term. Scientists used it (and
still do) to describe any event or fact that could be observed, amazing or not. An earthquake, for
example, was a phenomenon, because you could see it (and hear it and feel it). Phenomenon is an
example of a word having a specific meaning for one group of people that gets changed when used by
the general public.
