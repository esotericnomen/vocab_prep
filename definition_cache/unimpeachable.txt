Unimpeachable describes someone or something that is totally, completely, without any doubt,
innocent and good, like an unimpeachable role model who avoids bad influences and sketchy
situations.

Impeach means to accuse, or charge with a crime. It is a verb usually reserved for when high-ranking
officials like presidents do something wrong. So, when you add the prefix im- and the suffix -able,
the result is an adjective that means not able to be accused, in other words, beyond doubt or
question. If you run for public office and your past is unimpeachable, your opponents will have
nothing to use against you in their advertisements.
