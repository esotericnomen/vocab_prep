Resignation can either mean to step down from a job or office, or to accept an unpleasant but
inevitable situation. You could even feel resignation as you announce your resignation.

Once you've announced or handed in your formal resignation to a job, organization, or political
office, you're finished. You've formally quit or stepped down. If you've left the position due to
budget cuts, you'll probably leave with a feeling of resignation Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; acknowledging that
there's absolutely nothing you can do about it.
