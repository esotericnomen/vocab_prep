Effectual means good at achieving the results you want. The most effectual method for avoiding
cavities? Brush, floss, lay off the candy, and see your dentist every 6 months.

Wait, aren't effectual and effective basically the same adjectives with the same meaning? Well,
generally speaking, yes. But if you want to get really nit-picky, you might note that effectual
actually describes something that produces the desired result, but in a big way. Effective simply
gets the job done. No one is going to call you out for using either word interchangeably though, as
long as it's done effectually.
