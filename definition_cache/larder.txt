When your mother buys groceries, she puts them in the larder or the pantry. A larder is a room or
cabinet where you store food.

Larder is an old-fashioned word, created back when people used lard â&euro;&rdquo; rendered animal
fat â&euro;&rdquo; to grease pans and cook food. The larder is where they kept their bacon and
their lard. Now it's where you keep your potato chips and your cookies.
