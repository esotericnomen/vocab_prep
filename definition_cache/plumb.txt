To plumb a body of water, you measure its depth. To plumb a house, you connect all of its pipes. To
make carpentry plumb, you get it exactly vertical.

Originally, the verb plumb only meant “to measure the depth of water.” These days, if you
“plumb the depths” of something, you go in deep for knowledge and experience: your Heidegger
seminar may plumb the depths of German Existentialism like Jacques Cousteau plumbed the depths of
the ocean.
