A mortar is a bowl-shaped container that you can grind things in using a pestle. You probably buy
your spices pre-ground at the store, but if you wanted to be old-school, you could grind them
yourself with a mortar and pestle.

Mortar is an old word Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; it comes from Old English, and using a mortar to smash things
up is old way of cooking. It's also the builder's paste used between bricks. If you've heard the
phrase brick and mortar, that's a style of building, as well as a general phrase for something with
a real building (as opposed to an internet business). And it's also a gun that fires high bullets
that land short-range.
