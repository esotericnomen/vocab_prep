Heed is an old word, meaning to listen to and follow. It can also be used as a noun: Take heed of my
instructions, little boy, said the old bearded man. My potion will only work for the one who wears
the ring.

The most common use of heed is with warnings. The word derives from Old English hēdan and is
related to the Dutch hoeden and German hüten––from Germanic cultures where fairy tales with
mysterious warnings and magical consequences abound.
