Arrows, sides of a rectangle, well-organized lines of people waiting to get into the theater or the
ladies' room, and anything else free from curves can be described as straight. The word can also
mean honest, uninterrupted, undiluted, or heterosexual.

In Middle English, strecchen meant to stretch. Streght stretched emerged from it and morphed into
straight. It's easy to see the connection: If you stretch out a piece of spaghetti or a curl, it
looks linear. Today the word means free from bends, breaks, or irregularities literally or
figuratively. Give it to me straight means just the facts, ma'am. I was up for seven straight days
means I haven't slept in a week.
