Things that are touchy are hard to handle — not literally, but to talk about. Touchy subjects make
people upset.

There are a lot of touchy topics in life. Religion is a big one, since people have such different
yet strong beliefs. Racism and sexism are touchy. Politics can be touchy. Asking someone how old
they are or what they weigh are very touchy questions. Something is touchy is you need to handle it
with kid gloves — or maybe avoid the topic altogether. People often use euphemisms — soft,
evasive terms — for touchy subjects, to make discussing them easier.
