A fleck is a small patch that is different from it rest, standing out from the background, like
flecks of green in your blue eyes or flecks of light shining on the ground under a tree.

The noun fleck can describe a color or a spot of light that stands out, like a fleck of orange in a
brown and white plaid, or the little bits of light reflected off a sequined top. It can also
describe a particle, such as a fleck of dirt you track into your house on your shoe. Fleck can also
be a verb that means dotting or marking something with little spots, like when you fleck paint on
the wall to produce a random dotted effect.
