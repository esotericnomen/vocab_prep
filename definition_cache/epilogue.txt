If you like to read the end of a book first, then maybe the epilogue is for you. The epilogue is a
short piece that wraps up the end of a story.

The noun epilogue can also refer to the short speech at the end of a play that one of the characters
speaks directly to the audience. In Shakespeare's play The Tempest, the epilogue is a 20-line
monologue spoken by Prospero. Epilogue comes from the Greek word epilogus meaning the conclusion of
a speech.
