If you’re fussy, you’re all about the little details. You want the dressing on the side, you
want your collar just so, and you want the place mats arranged at a 90 degree angle.

The word fussy came into English in the 19th century, but it’s a good bet that people have been
fussy since the beginning of time. If you’re fussy, you’re really picky about your needs and
requirements. You might be fussy about your food and refuse to eat cauliflower. You’re rarely
satisfied — that can be annoying! Fussy can also describe something that has too much going on,
like a fussy shirt that has ruffles, buttons, and a large floral pattern.
