To bound is to jump or hop — usually as you run. Bound can also mean to go or to plan to go,
especially to a certain destination, as in being bound for New York or homeward-bound.

Superman can leap tall buildings in a single bound, but the word bound is usually about boundaries.
When you're playing soccer or football, the ball goes out of bounds. Someone can also be bound with
rope — tied up. Commitments are another kind of tie. When you get married, you're bound to your
partner. If you make a promise, you're bound to your word. On a less pleasant note, if you're
constipated, you're bound up.
