A malcontent is someone who's always dissatisfied.  The guy at the restaurant who sends back the
steak because it's too rare, then sends it back a second time complaining that it's not rare enough
— he's a malcontent.

Malcontent is often used to describe people who complain about more important things than steaks —
things like social and political injustice. In Shakespeare's day, the Malcontent was a popular
character type. Hamlet was a classic Malcontent.  He believed that his uncle, King Claudius,
murdered his father for power, and it made him angry that everyone else seemed to think that
Claudius was a good person.
