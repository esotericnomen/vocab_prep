The hinterlands are affectionately called the sticks, or the boonies, short for boondocks. Use it to
specify an area that is far away from a city or town, or even civilization as we know it.  Cell-
phone reception and cable television aren't guaranteed.

The noun hinterland comes to the English language via Germany:  hinter is behind + land is, well,
land. It actually refers to the land lying inland â&euro;&rdquo; or behind â&euro;&rdquo; an ocean
coast or river shore, which is why backwaters  and hinterlands are used interchangeably. Use
hinterlands when you want to make fun of an area's backwardness, or to celebrate its natural beauty:
Coming from the unspoiled hinterlands of Louisiana, she found it hard to adjust to the sights and
sounds of the big city.
