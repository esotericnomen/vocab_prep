A scholar who is fascinated with a subject and knows a lot about it might write a monograph, or a
long, detailed paper on one topic.

If your favorite subject in school is the study of insects, you may one day write a monograph on
entomology, full of details about beetles and wasps. A monograph is usually researched carefully,
with plenty of footnotes along the way. The thesis or dissertation a college student writes as a
requirement for getting a degree is one type of monograph. The word comes from the Greek mono,
single, and graph, something written.
