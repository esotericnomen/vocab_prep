Mute means “silent.” No matter how much you talk to your houseplants, they’ll never talk back;
they'll remain mute.

When used as a noun, mute can mean “someone who isn't capable of speech or “a device that
deadens the sound of an instrument.” Mute can also be used as a verb meaning to make silent.”
One might mute the television by pressing a button on the remote, or one might try to mute a
loquacious individual. Unfortunately, the technology for that last option doesn’t exist yet.
