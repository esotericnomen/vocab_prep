A person who is very sick or injured and needs frequent care is an invalid. Also, something no
longer current or useful is invalid.

The main uses of this word have to do with people and things that don't work very well anymore. A
driver's license that has expired is invalid Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; it needs to be renewed. If you lost
your health insurance, it's invalid. People who are called invalids are disabled or incapacitated
severely. Be careful with this word, because some think it is inappropriate, since it sounds as if
some people are not as valid as others based on physical capability.
