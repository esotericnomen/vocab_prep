If you forgot flowers on your Mom's birthday, you can still propitiate her by sending a bouquet the
next day. Propitiate means to appease someone or make them happy by doing a particular thing. Handy
strategy for lovers, too.

One of the most common uses of propitiate historically was in the sense of appeasing the Gods, often
with a gift in the form of an animal or human sacrifice. Fortunately, for most people today flowers
and candy will do the trick. But then again, some Moms can be tough to appease.
