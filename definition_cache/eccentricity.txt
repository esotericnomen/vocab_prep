Eccentricity is strange, out-of-the-ordinary, sometimes weirdly attractive behavior or dress.
Sleeping with your boots on is pretty normal if you're a cowboy, but leaving them on for bedtime in
your city apartment, that shows some eccentricity.

Eccentricity goes back to the Greek ekkentros, meaning off center, and when you describe people as
being a little off, you might be talking about their eccentricity or behavior that's a bit abnormal.
An eccentricity might be some really small character trait, like eating all of the green food on
your plate first, or a large and very obvious characteristic, as when you ride a donkey to your
suburban school instead of taking the bus.
