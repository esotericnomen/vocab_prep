The noun carousal describes a rowdy gathering that involves drinking too much alcohol. Carousal is

Carousal stumbled into English by way of the French word carousser, meaning, drink, quaff, swill,
which in turn traces back to the German gar austrinken, meaning to drink up entirely. As you might
guess, the word carousal involves drinking â&euro;&rdquo; lots of it. A verb form, carouse, carries
a related meaning â&euro;&rdquo; people carouse at a carousal. In other words, they drink a lot at
the booze party.
