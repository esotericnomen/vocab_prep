Engulf is a verb that means being completely surrounded, soaked, or covered. Fire, snow, smoke,
flood waters, or even violence are a few things that could engulf you.

Suppose an amusement park had a ride called Into the Whirlpool. Sounds like one for thrill-seekers
who aren't afraid of water. Riders should expect to get lost inside, fully absorbed by the
experience. The word engulf comes from the Old French word golfe, meaning whirlpool, and the prefix
en-, meaning in or into. Riders of Into the Whirlpool should expect to feel engulfed Ã¢&euro;&rdquo;
surrounded by water and completely covered.
