Have you noticed how so many of the best TV shows concentrate on a group of friends who seem to mesh
together perfectly, to the exclusion of all others? This, then, is a coterie, an exclusive group
with common interests.

The modern spelling and meaning of coterie developed in the 18th century from a French word rooted
in the feudal system. When the farmers working the land of a feudal lord established an
organization, they were called cotiers, or tenants of a cote (think cottage), and that idea of a
select group led to the word coterie. There's just something so French about the idea of
exclusivity, isn't there?
