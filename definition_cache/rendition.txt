A rendition is an interpretation, performance, or translation. Whitney Houston's rendition of the
Star Spangled Banner is still used at games today; Roseanne Barr's is not.

This word comes from the Old French rendre, which means â&euro;&oelig;to deliver, yield.â&euro;?
So if you want to put your spin on a song or poem or your favorite movie monologue, go ahead and
deliver your rendition of it. But know that in modern times this word has also been used as a noun,
describing the secret capture and interrogation of a terror suspect in a foreign country that has
less strict human rights laws.
