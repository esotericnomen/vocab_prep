If something is insufferable, it's unbearable and impossible, like the insufferable humidity of the
rain forest room at the zoo on a hot summer day.

You can see the word suffer in insufferable Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; and it's no coincidence. If it's
unacceptable or too much to handle, it's insufferable. An egotistic co-worker is insufferable, and
so is a blizzard that leaves six-foot drifts against the doors of your house, or insufferable
working conditions in many of the factories that produce goods around the world.
