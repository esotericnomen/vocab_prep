If you have an old bronze sculpture with a surface that has oxidized and turned green or brown, that
coating is called a patina. A patina can appear on anything made of metal.

A patina can also be the shiny surface on wooden furniture that you get after years and years of
polishing. You can also use the word in a metaphorical sense, to describe somebody who has acquired
some surface character that doesn't go very deep Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; like the tycoon who has a patina of
sophistication but only pretends to be interested in art and literature.
