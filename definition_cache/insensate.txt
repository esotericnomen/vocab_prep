Insensate is a word to describe something without feelings or consciousness. Cars, computers, and
stuffed animals are all insensate (though some of us occasionally project thoughts and personalities
onto them).

Insensate can also describe individuals who seem to lack the characteristically human emotions of
kindness and generosity. A person who tears a stuffed animal out of the hands of a young child might
be described as insensate. Another meaning of insensate is “lacking intelligence.” In short,
insensate, in any sense of the word, is usually something that you don’t want to be.
