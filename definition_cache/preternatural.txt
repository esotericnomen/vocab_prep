Preternatural describes something that seems oddly abnormal and out of sync with everything else. If
you hear a preternatural dog's barking, maybe it sounds like a police siren instead of a howl.

Note that preternatural contains the word natural. Preter comes from the Latin word praeter which
means beyond; so something preternatural is beyond nature. It is less commonly used than unnatural
or supernatural but means the same thing. If you lift a truck off the ground and hold it above your
head, people will marvel at you and say you have preternatural strength.
