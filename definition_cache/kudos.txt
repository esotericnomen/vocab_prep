If you're really good at judo, you will get kudos, or praise and congratulations, for your speed and
strength.

You get kudos for doing something well, whether a class presentation, a chore, or a performance in a
game or recital. Getting kudos for doing something that makes you famous or well-known is possible
too, though it's easier to get kudos just for doing a good job. Kudos looks like a plural noun, but
the s is just the ending of the original Greek word.
