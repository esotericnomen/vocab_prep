If you have a cushy job — one that pays, but involves minimal work — then you have a sinecure.
Because he was the brother of the CEO, he was offered a sinecure in the company: he showed up each
day and collected a pay check, but others actually did his work.

The noun sinecure comes from the Latin root words sine cura meaning without care. It originally was
used to describe a church position that did not include caring for the souls of parishioners, but
that meaning is considered archaic now. The word is now usually associated with political
appointments.
