Relegate means assign to a lower position. If the quarterback of the football team stops making
decent throws he might be relegated to the position of benchwarmer, while another kid is given the
chance to play.

Relegate rhymes with delegateâ&euro;&ldquo;â&euro;&ldquo;both words derive from the Latin legare
send. Relegate means to send someone down in rank. Delegate means to send someone in your place to
complete a task. In the workplace, managers who can't figure out how to delegate may get relegated
to a lesser rank.
