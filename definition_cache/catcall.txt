Boooo! Hisss! Come on ref! Are you blind?! Those are just a few family-friendly catcalls, or rowdy
cries of disapproval.

Next time you're stuck watching a terrible movie, don't throw rotten tomatoes at the screen. Try a
catcall instead. The impassioned taunts and disapproving shouts are already a staple at sporting
events across the globe. They're also a favorite among construction workers, who like to whistle at
and catcall the ladies walking by. Which, by the way, is totally inappropriate.
