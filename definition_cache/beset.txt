Beset means to attack from all sides––an invading army will beset a castle, or you might find
yourself beset by a devastating storm.

Beset also has a very different meaning: to decorate or encrust with jewels or other ornamentation.
If you are attending a ball, you may choose a gown that is beset with silver sequins, just be
careful that you don't end up looking like a giant disco ball.
