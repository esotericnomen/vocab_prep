Next time you cringe when a family member calls you by your childhood nickname in public, remember,
Snoopy, it's just a term of endearment â€” meant to show affection, not make you miserably
embarrassed.

When you break apart the word endearment, you probably recognize the word endear, a verb that means
to make admired or beloved. The suffix -ment can turn a verb into a noun, so endearment is something
that shows affection or admiration, like calling someone my love instead of his or her name or
playfully whacking your brother on the head when you walk by where he sits, doing his homework.
