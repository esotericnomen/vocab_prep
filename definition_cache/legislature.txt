A legislature is a governing body that makes laws and can also amend or repeal them.

The word legislature comes from the Latin word for law â&euro;&rdquo; legis. In the US, each state
has a legislature â&euro;&rdquo; made up of the elected state senators and assemblymen or women, or
representatives. The US Congress is the national legislature. These bodies, whose members are often
referred to as law-makers, make up the legislative branch of government, as distinct from the
executive and judicial branches.
