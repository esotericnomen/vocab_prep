A humane person is one who shows great compassion and caring for others, including animals, and who
tries whenever possible to alleviate another's suffering.

The idea of being humane is linked to a higher level of a person's character. While the word is
derived from the word human, the sad fact is that a person can be human without being humane.
Britain's Royal Humane Society, created in 1774 to rescue drowning people, focuses on recognizing
acts of human bravery. In the United States, however, the Humane Society works to eliminate cruelty
to animals. Still, both focus on kindness and the humane care of others.
