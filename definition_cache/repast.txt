Whether it's a sumptuous feast you're sitting down to or just a simple bite to eat, a repast is just
another word for meal.

Based on the Latin word repascere, which means to feed, a repast is any collection of food served
and eaten at one time. In verb form, repast means to eat or feast. So at least by dictionary
standards, you should feel free to repast on cheese doodles and marshmallow fluff for your morning
repast Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; in other words, eat junk for breakfast.
