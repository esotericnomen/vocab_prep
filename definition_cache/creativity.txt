Creativity is the ability to transcend the ordinary. It's the critical thinking skill that allows
you to think outside the box to come up with original solutions to problems.

We often think of creativity as limited to the arts, but it is a necessary element in all areas of
life. Without creativity we would not have the mathematical theories that presented us with
fractals, or the technological imagination that could foresee people walking on the moon. It was
creativity that harnessed lightning into electricity and later used that electricity to send
messages through wires. Without creativity, we probably would never have invented the wheel or
domesticated fire!
