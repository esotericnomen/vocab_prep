Whether it's a thrilling action-adventure film, a collection of Valentino shoes, or that enigmatic
girl you see on the subway, when something is so fascinating that it holds all your attention, it is
said to enthrall.

If you’ve even fallen under someone’s spell, it won’t surprise you to learn that when enthrall
first entered the English language it carried the meaning of “to hold in mental or moral
bondage” or “to enslave.” Nowadays the verb enthrall is used to describe something so
wonderful and captivating that the person experiencing it feels like a slave. If you enthrall
someone, you make them powerless — in a sense, a slave to your charms.
