A malleable personality is capable of being changed or trained, and a malleable metal is able to be
pounded or pressed into various shapes. It's easier to learn when you're young and malleable.

Similarly, there are ductile metals that can be hammered out into wire or thread; gold, silver, and
platinum are examples. The adjective malleable dates back to Middle English, from Old French, from
Medieval Latin malleÄ bilis, from malleÄ re to hammer, from Latin malleus a hammer.
