Calorific is a good word for describing something that generates heat.  A motorcycle race can be
calorific in at least two ways: The engines get burning hot, and watching the race can make you burn
with excitement.

In today's diet-obsessed world, you'd be forgiven for thinking that calorific means filled with
calories. In fact, when you do something calorific you don't load up on calories; you get rid of
them. Say you drink a bottle of soda and then jump on the treadmill.  All those calories you just
poured down your throat? You're burning them up, turning them into heat.  Running is a calorific
activity. And a sweaty one.
