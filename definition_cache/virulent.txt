A virulent disease is one that's infectious, spreading and making lots of people sick, while a
virulent rant is just a verbal attack, causing sickness of the emotional kind. Either way, something
virulent puts a strain on the people who get it.

Two meanings come out of the roots for virulent: one being poisonous and the other, spiteful. The
virus-carrying meaning of virulent often gets combined with strain, such as in a virulent strain of
the flu. Those who aren√¢&euro;&trade;t carrying disease but are still considered virulent most
likely lash out at others with a biting tone. Unleashing acid-tongued words on someone would be
considered a virulent attack.
