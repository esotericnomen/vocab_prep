Raze means to tear an object down to the ground. Before Donald Trump can raze that family's home to
build another skyscraper, he's going to have to cut them a big check.

Raze is most often used to refer to knocking buildings down for construction projects, but it can
also describe tearing down other objects. You can raze the sand dunes in order to make the beach
perfectly flat. Raze comes from the word rasen, meaning to scrape or erase, and it sounds similar to
the word erase, which can help you remember its meaning. If you raze something, in a way it has been
erased Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; it no longer exists in its previous form.
