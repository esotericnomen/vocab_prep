Coercion is making something happen by force, like when bullies use coercion to make kids give them
their lunch money.

Coercion can be a threat, The shady lawyer uses coercion when he threatens to get the waiter fired
if he doesn't rat out his boss, or it can be actual brute force, as when the gangster breaks the
messenger's leg to keep her from talking to the police. The police might use coercion, too, to get a
confession. The prefix co- is derived from the Latin word for together. So you can't use coercion on
yourself; you need someone else to force into doing something.
