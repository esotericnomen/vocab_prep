Irremediable describes something that can’t be saved, like an irremediable misunderstanding
between friends that means the relationship is over.

The adjective irremediable came into English from the Latin word irremediabilis, a combination of
in-, meaning “not,” and remediabilis, meaning “curable.” Heed the wisdom of the Latins, and
save irremediable to describe those hopeless situations that simply can’t be fixed or put right.
For example, if something causes irremediable damage, give up and move on.
