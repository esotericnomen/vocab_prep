As a noun, a simian is a monkey or ape. Something monkey- or ape-like can be described using the
adjective simian. So: something can be simian without being a simian. Got it?

The first syllable in simian rhymes with dim and gets the accent: SIM-ee-an. This is a case in which
the adjective form came before the noun. How? Simian comes from the Greek word simos, meaning snub-
nosed, bent upward. It wasn't until the late nineteenth century that this description became the
label for those animals whose noses simian describes.
