When you unlock your front door, you open the latch. A latch is a fastener or lock that you open
with a key.

A latch can usually be opened with a key or by turning a knob or lifting a hook or bar. You can also
use the word latch as a verb, like when your mom reminds you to latch the front and back doors
before you leave for school in the morning. In some places, the word latch-key is used to mean key.
The root of latch is the Germanic word lĂŚccan, to grasp or seize.
