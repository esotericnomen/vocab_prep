A scrimmage is a practice — not an official game — in American football, hockey, and in other
team sports.

You might think of football when you hear the word scrimmage, because the ball is placed on the line
of scrimmage at the start of a play. A scrimmage is also a practice between two squads. You can also
use scrimmage as a verb for other types of practicing. A basketball player might scrimmage by
shooting one hundred free throws, for example. Originally, scrimmage was a variation on the word
skirmish, and meant a confused struggle between players.
