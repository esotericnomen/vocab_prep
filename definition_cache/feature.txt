A feature is a part of something that makes it special or able to work better, such as a bonus
feature on a DVD or a smartphone feature that provides faster Internet connections.

The word feature has both a noun and a verb form used to describe a main characteristic, as in a
car's safety features or a restaurant menu that features Italian dishes. In addition, feature can
refer to a newspaper or magazine article that provides in-depth information, like a feature about
the First Lady and her life. You√¢&euro;&trade;ve probably also heard it used to describe a main
part of the face, such as the eyes, nose, or mouth.
