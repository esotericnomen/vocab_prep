Friendship is the state of being friends with someone. A good job, good health, and romantic love
are important, but without real friendship, your life might not feel full.

When we talk about friendship, we're often talking about the value of having friends, not just the
fact of it. A book might explore the importance of friendship in a young girl's life. You might
decide to stop working such long hours and spend more time developing your friendships, in an effort
to lead a happier life. A deep friendship can last through many shifts and changes in life, as long
as you write or call every now and then.
