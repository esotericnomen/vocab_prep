When you intersperse something, you scatter it with spaces in between, the way you intersperse
vegetable seeds along a row in a garden bed.

A wallpaper pattern might intersperse polka dots with bright flowers, and a writer might intersperse
colorful details throughout an essay on the sword fishing industry. If you place things here and
there, at intervals or leaving room between each item, you intersperse them. The Latin root is
interspersus, strewn or scattered, and in the mid-1500s the word intersperse was used mostly to mean
diversify by introducing things at intervals.
