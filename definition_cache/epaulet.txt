An epaulet is a decoration that is attached to the shoulders of a uniform. If you are a guard at
Buckingham Palace, you have pretty nice epaulets on your uniform, but they aren’t as amazing as
that hat.

The noun epaulet comes from the Late Latin meaning of spatula, “shoulder blade.” Any fancy
extras attached on the exterior shoulders of a garment can be called an epaulet. Epaulets often have
gold braided embroidery. Or stars. Some have fringe. The epaulets on the uniforms of airline pilots
have four rows of braids, which distinguishes them as a higher rank than co-pilots, who wear three
braids.
