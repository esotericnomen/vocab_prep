Your habitat is the environment you are accustomed to living in. Zoos usually try to mimic the
habitats of the animals they keep, housing bats in a nocturnal house and monkeys in a cage with
trees to climb and swing from.

The origins of habitat aren't exactly what you would expect. The word goes back to the Latin
habitare meaning to live or dwell, which itself goes back to habere meaning to have or own. It seems
logical that if you own a place, it is your home. Habitat is usually used with animals and plants
that live in and are adapted to a specific environment. In nature, orchids and banana plants live in
a warm, humid habitat.
