Transmute is a verb meaning to change in appearance or form. For example, magical creatures can
transmute into other beings. When you slay a dragon, don’t be surprised if changes into a small,
winged insect.

More realistically, you, too, can transmute your appearance — by dying your hair, piercing your
nose, or changing your style of dress. Transmute often describes physical change — like when
alchemists tried to transmute lead into gold — but it can also be used more figuratively to
describe anything that's transformed. For example, you might transmute your sketchy memories of
growing up in Boston into the Great American Novel.
