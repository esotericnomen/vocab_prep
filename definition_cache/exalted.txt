Use the adjective exalted to describe something (or someone) that is raised in rank, value, or
power. Which group has the most exalted status at your high school depends on who you ask. If you
ask music kids, they may say marching band. If you ask a football player...

Exalted goes back to Latin exaltare, combining ex up and altus high. You may not have an exalted
position at school -- maybe you're even one of the peons who isn't going to have a full-page spread
dedicated to their achievements in the yearbook -- but you'll always have an exalted role in your
family, where your quiet humor and up-for-everything attitude brings your siblings together.
