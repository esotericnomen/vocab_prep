Taint means to contaminate. If your water supply is tainted with arsenic, you should stop drinking
it right away.

Tainted and tinted are similarly spelled words with dissimilar meanings–-tint is what happens when
you add color to something––if you tint white with red, you get pink. On the other hand, if you
taint something, you are somehow spoiling or corrupting it. If you taint meat with the salmonella
virus, you have a disaster and a public panic.
