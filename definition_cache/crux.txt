The essential point or problem is the crux. People are always trying to get to the crux of a matter
or the crux of a problem, while others try to distract them.

The noun crux is often followed by the phrases of the matter or of the problem. When people are
trying to identify the crux of something, it's like the want to get to the heart of it. They want to
peel back the layers and find out what something is really all about or what is causing the problem.
No more beating around the bush!
