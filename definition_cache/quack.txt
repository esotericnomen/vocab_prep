There are good quacks and bad quacks. A good quack is the sound a duck makes. A bad quack is someone
pretending to be a doctor. (You'd be better off visiting the duck with your ailment.)

If you ever get a chance to interview a celebrity duck, prepare to write the word quack in your
notebook many, many times, because thatâ&euro;&trade;s all that ducks can say. The way you spell
animal sounds changes depending what language you speak. In English a duck quacks, but in Danish a
duck raps, while Indonesian ducks wek, and Romanian ducks say mac. And that MD who
isnâ&euro;&trade;t really a doctor, but is good at pretending to be one? He's a quack. If you ever
meet a quack that quacks, please run.
