After is a preposition meaning later in time or behind in space. After many hours of dancing, you'll
be sweaty and hungry.

The word after goes all the way back to Sanskrit (meaning further off or beyond). You can use it in
the context of time, as in, Meet me after dinner and we'll take a walk, or of space, as in, After
you pass the school, you'll see the library on your right. After can also be an adverb. If you like
ships, you'll recognize the relationship of after to aft, which means the rear part of the ship.
