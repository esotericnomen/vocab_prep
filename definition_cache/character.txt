When Martin Luther King said he looked forward to the day when all Americans would be judged solely
by the content of their character, he was talking about a person's essential qualities.

Just because you are a character doesn't mean you have character, a guy called The Wolf advises a
young woman named Raquel in Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction. The line illustrates three different
senses of the word, which can mean moral strength or reputation (what Raquel lacks), a person in a
work of fiction (what The Wolf and Raquel literally are), or, by extension, a colorful personality
(what Raquel has). A fourth usage is the distinctive nature of a person or thing, a meaning
reflected in the word's origins. In Greek, a kharaktÄ“r was a stamping tool, used to give something
a distinctive mark.
