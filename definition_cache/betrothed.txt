Betrothed means formally engaged. If you are betrothed, then, congratulations! As they say in the
song, you’re going to the chapel — you’re going to get married.

Betrothed came into English through a combination of bi-, or thoroughly, and treowðe, the Old
English word for truth, a pledge. If you are betrothed, you are completely and formally pledged to
someone. Betrothed has a slightly more old fashioned and formal feel than its synonym engaged, but
both describe people who are between Will you marry me? and I do.
