If your friend gives you a piece of jewelry that has a raised carving of a face in profile showing
all the curves and shapes, that’s called a cameo.

Often used to show a person’s head in profile, a cameo typically has two layers of color: one
color for the subject and another one for the background. The detail is depicted not by color or
shades but instead by the raised design, which is called a relief. A cameo is typically used for a
piece of jewelry, such as a ring or a brooch, and it has an ornate, old-fashioned quality. You may
have seen this type of jewelry depicted in Victorian paintings or possibly worn by your great
grandmother.
