A precinct is an area of town marked off for official purposes, often to vote, or to organize the
police force.  When a cop hears of a crime on the police blotter that's happening in his precinct,
he knows to hop in his car and head over there.

The word precinct comes from the Latin precinctum meaning enclosure, boundary line. A precinct is an
area that has a clear boundary line around it, making it easier for the police to know where a crime
is taking place, or where you should go to vote.  The word precinct has also come to mean police
headquarters in a particular district. If you're being held at the precinct, you're at the police
station local to where you committed your crime.
