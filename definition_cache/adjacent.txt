Adjacent means close to or near something. You may consider the people up and down your street to be
neighbors, but your next door neighbor is the person who lives in the house or apartment adjacent to
yours.

Adjacent can refer to two things that touch each other or have the same wall or border. And the
adjective is often followed by the preposition to: Her office is adjacent to mine. This word is from
Latin adjacere to lie near, from the prefix ad- to plus jacere to lie, throw.
