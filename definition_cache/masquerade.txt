To masquerade means to pretend to be someone else. If you masquerade as a sweet, kind-hearted
person, you present that image to the world, hiding your true identity as a jerk who has rage
issues.

As a verb, masquerade can also mean to dress up as someone else, in costume. At the parade, you will
masquerade as the court jester, wearing a purple outfit and bells and tossing candy to little kids.
The noun masquerade refers to both your costume, which usually includes a mask, and the event where
you will wear it. The fun is in hiding your real identity for the night.
