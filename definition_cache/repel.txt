Use the verb repel when you want to turn something away, like drenched yourself in bug spray in an
attempt to repel the mosquitoes that plague you when you go camping.

This versatile word can be used in relation to everything from bugs to unwanted romantic advances.
The word repel can be used to describe the act of driving something away, as in the case of bugs or
other pesky critters, including potential suitors. It can also be used to describe something that
causes disgust or distaste. For example, the thought of eating snails might repel you.
