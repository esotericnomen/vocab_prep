If a highly forgetful person loses his phone, his wallet, and then his car keys in separate
instances all in one day, you could say that he has reached an organizational nadir. This means
“lowest point.”

This was originally strictly an astronomical term and is the opposite of the word zenith, which is
the part of the sky located directly above a person’s head or, “high point.”  In fact, nadir
is derived from the Arabic nazir, which means “opposite to.” It is still used in astronomy to
indicate the part of the celestial sphere located directly below an observer, but also more
generally to describe the worst point of someone’s life or career.
