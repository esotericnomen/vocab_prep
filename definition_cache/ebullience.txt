Bubbly, loud, and enthusiastic, ebullience means the quality of being cheerful and full of energy.
Take a room full of seven-year-olds and add a bunch of adorable puppies, and you'll end up with
ebullience.

The Latin word ebullientem, which ebullience comes from, literally means boiling over. When you see
ebullience, you know it; it's not simply happiness or enjoyment, but those emotions bubbling up and
overflowing.
