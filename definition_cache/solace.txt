If something eases your disappointment or grief, consider it a solace. If you're sad, you might find
solace in music or in talking to your friends.

It is no surprise that consolation and solace are similar in meaning as they share a root in the
Latin verb sōlārī to comfort. In fact, solace and consolation are synonyms meaning relief from
grief or disappointment. When you go to sleepaway camp, your parents will miss you, but they'll find
solace in knowing that you are having fun.
