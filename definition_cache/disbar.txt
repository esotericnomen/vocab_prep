To disbar is to officially take away a lawyer’s license to practice law. If a practicing lawyer
gets caught doing something illegal or crazy, it’s time to disbar.

“The bar” is the exam that lawyers-to-be must pass after law school so they can practice law.
The word bar comes from the wooden bar that surrounds the judge, where the barrister (lawyer) states
a case. If you're disbarred, you can no longer practice. A lawyer found guilty of a crime or any
other unethical behavior could be disbarred. Getting disbarred is a serious matter — you can tell
because it happens to lawyers on TV shows all the time.
