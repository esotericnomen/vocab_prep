Monotheism is the belief in a single all-powerful god, as opposed to religions that believe in
multiple gods. Judaism and Christianity are widely practiced forms of monotheism.

Monotheism comes from the combination of the Greek prefixes monos-, “alone” or “single,” and
theo-, “god.” There are many words that come from the Greek base theo-: theology, polytheist,
and atheism, to name a few.  All of these theo- words have to do with god, gods, or the study of
religion. Monotheism is any religion that believes in one god. Buddhism, for instance, isn’t an
example of monotheism because Buddha is not considered a god who created the universe.
