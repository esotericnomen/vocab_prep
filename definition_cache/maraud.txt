As a verb maraud means to rove about the countryside looking for goods to steal and in general, to
make mayhem and trouble. The Gilbert and Sullivan opera The Pirates of Penzance is about a band of
marauding pirates, the daughters of Major-General Stanley, and a big misunderstanding.

The word maraud comes from the Middle French word meant rascal or rogue. A marauder is someone who
marauds and marauding describes people who raid and plunder. As a noun, a maraud is a quick, short
foray. As a teenager, you may have participated in a midnight maraud to festoon your friend's house
with toilet paper or capture the mascot of your rival sports team.
