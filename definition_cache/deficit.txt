If you're running a deficit, you are losing. You might be losing money or losing a game. Either way,
you better make up for it.

When the government runs on a deficit, often the loss can be offset by a raise in taxes. If you have
a deficit of iron in your body, you should consider eating more spinach. The word deficit comes from
the Latin deficit meaning it is wanting. A deficit is characterized by the wanting of something
missing.
