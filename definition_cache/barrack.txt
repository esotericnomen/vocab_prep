A barrack is a building where military personnel live. It’s usually used in the plural, as
barracks. It’s also a verb — when soldiers lodge in barracks, they barrack there. The word
sounds like “bear-ick.”

Barrack comes from the Spanish barraca for soldier's tent. Now it’s more than a tent. Barracks are
the buildings where soldiers, commanders, medical staff, and anyone else affiliated with the
military lodge. Many barracks are temporary buildings that can be taken down quickly and reassembled
elsewhere. Other barracks are more sturdy and permanent, but the people who barrack (stay there) are
always people in the military.
