The word sequester describes being kept away from others. If your sister tells you to stay out of
the way so she can cook dinner for her new boyfriend, you might sequester yourself in your room.

Legal types may be familiar with the word sequester since it√¢&euro;&trade;s often used in relation
to a jury for an important trial. In that case, members of the jury are sequestered, meaning they
aren't allowed to watch the news or read articles that could influence their judgment. However,
sequester can describe anyone who is isolated or hidden away from others, like a pop star
sequestered in a hotel room, protected from fans' mania below.
