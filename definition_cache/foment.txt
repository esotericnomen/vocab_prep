Stand outside the school cafeteria passing out flyers with nutritional details on school food, and
you may foment a revolution––foment means stirring up something undesirable, such as trouble.

You would never say, Hooray, we fomented a revolution. Instead you'd say, Those good for nothing
scalawags fomented the rebellion. Don't confuse foment and ferment. Ferment can mean to stir up in a
good way––a football game can ferment excitement in a town, or foment trouble through traffic
tie-ups and litter.
