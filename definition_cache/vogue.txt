If something is the latest vogue, it is the latest fashion. When your new hairstyle catches on, it's
in vogue —  or if it becomes unpopular, it’s not.

Anything trendy or popular — an activity, fashionable clothing, a home decorating style, board
games — can be called “in vogue.” If you notice everyone scrambling to collect, say, robotic
hummingbirds, you'll know that they are the vogue item. You might think that tall boots are no
longer in vogue, and you notice a lot of short skirts showing up in Vogue magazine. Vogue — the
magazine — often decides what fashion is in vogue.
