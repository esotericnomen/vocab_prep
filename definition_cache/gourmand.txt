A gourmand is someone obsessively and unhealthily devoted to eating good food and lots of it.

In Monty Python's film The Meaning of Life, there is a character who literally explodes after eating
just one more mint after a big meal. Well, that in a nutshell is a gourmand. Gourmand is not to be
confused with gourmet. A gourmet is a connoisseur of good food who enjoys eating but doesn't do so
to excess. A gourmet might find himself full in his favorite restaurant, but he would never explode.
Both words are from the Medieval French term gourmant, meaning glutton.
