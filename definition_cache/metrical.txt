If the ruler you use is marked with millimeters and centimeters, you can say you use metrical
measurements.

The adjective metrical is a less common way to say metric, as in the metric system of measurement.
Instead of using inches and feet, a metrical system uses centimeters and meters as units for
measuring length. Most countries measure metrical distances, size, and lengths, although the United
States doesn't. The root of metrical is the Greek word metron, which means measure.
