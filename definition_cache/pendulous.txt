Walking a path with pendulous trees, the kind with hanging branches, is easier if you're five rather
than seven feet tall.

Pendulous most commonly refers to branches of trees or bushes, or other plant matter like flowers or
leaves that droop or bend downward. You could hide easily in the Amazon rain forest because of all
the pendulous plant life. When not referring to plants, pendulous means saggy or droopy.
