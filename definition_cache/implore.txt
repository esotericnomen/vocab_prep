You might ask your friend for a loan if you're short a few bucks, but if the bank is about to
foreclose on your house you'll implore your friend for the money, desperately begging for the cash
so you can keep your house.

The word implore is often used to describe an urgent request made out of desperation. A man on death
row might implore the governor to grant him a last-minute pardon. In the old days, you might have
heard the word spoken by someone with lousy aim at a duel Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; I implore you not to shoot
me, my good man! Today, this first-person use of the word sounds old-fashioned, although you might
still hear it in a period drama.
