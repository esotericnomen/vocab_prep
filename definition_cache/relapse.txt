A relapse is a decline, especially of someone's health. If your grandmother survived cancer only to
have it return two years later, you could say she suffered a relapse.

Relapse implies that someone has recovered from an illness and slid back into a worse state, like
when you are getting over a cold but then you suddenly feel bad all over again. Unwanted behavior
can also be described this way; if you find yourself biting your nails again, it's a nail-biting
relapse. The Latin word relabi is the root of relapse, slip back.
