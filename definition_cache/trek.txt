Want to go on a trek through the mountains? Make sure you have good shoes, drinking water, and
snacks. A trek is a long and difficult journey.

The word trek implies an extended trip that is hard Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; a climb up a mountain or a
journey through dense forests. In the movies and TV shows called Star Trek, the crew of the
Enterprise is on a journey through space that will last a long time. You wouldn't say that you took
a trek to the corner grocery unless you had to fight through three feet of snow to get there.
