A crossbreed is an animal or plant thatâ€™s a mixture of two different breeds or types. To
crossbreed is to produce a creature of this type. If you crossbreed a lion and a tiger, you make a
liger.

Geneticists, who study DNA, make crossbreeds when they mix parents with different genes to create a
new type of offspring. Often such crossbreeds are new kinds of plants. Different animals can be
mixed to create crossbreeds, too. A common example of a crossbreed is with dog breeds, like when a
poodle and a schnauzer are bred to create a schnoodle.
