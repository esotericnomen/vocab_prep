Vivid is an adjective that describes a bold and bright color, an intense feeling, or an image in
your mind that is so clear you can almost touch it.

Sometimes you have a vivid dream that feels so real that even when you wake up, you can’t tell if
the dream is really over.  In that dream, perhaps there were flowers with deep, rich, and vivid
colors that looked like they were painted.  Vivid comes from the Latin vivere, which means “to
live,” and vivid memories do seem to live on.
