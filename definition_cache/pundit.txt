Beware the pundit, a supposed expert who imparts deep knowledge to us more ignorant folks. Pundits
are often blowhards, mere hacks, and you might well want to take what they say with a pinch of salt.

Why not call them simply experts? Because pundit is a lovely word that has a slightly mocking sense
to it. Classic examples of the pundit are talk radio show hosts and professional sports
commentators, all brilliant dispensers of hot air amongst the odd insight and statistic. Our modern
day pundit is a far cry from the original meaning of the word, a learned man, master, or teacher,
from the ancient Hindi word payndit.
