Disagreeable sounds can be called dissonance. You know it's dissonance if you have the strong desire
to cover your ears with your hands.

Racket, noise, dissonance Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; all can describe sounds that are not pleasant. While some
musicians purposely add a little dissonance into their melodies to create an unexpected sound,
others, like someone who just started drum lessons, creates dissonance by accident. Dissonance can
also be a conflict between people or opinions, like the dissonance you feel when you want to do
something but your parents say no.
