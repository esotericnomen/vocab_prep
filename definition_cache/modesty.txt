Modesty is that shy feeling you get when someone brags about how great you are, or when you need to
take off your shirt to go swimming and showing skin makes you squirm.  If you blush, you’ve got
some modesty.

Modesty comes from the Latin modestus, which literally translates as “keeping due measure.”
Knowing the correct measure of yourself is modesty, and when someone praises you too much, your
modesty might kick in and make you want to tell them to be quiet.  Modesty also means you keep
things decent and not too outrageous, like wearing clothes that hide your skin, or painting your
walls beige instead of covering them with glow-in-the-dark diamond wallpaper.
