Use the noun foresight to describe successful planning for the future, like on a cloudy morning
having the foresight to bring an umbrella in case of rain showers later in the day.

The word foresight is made of two parts: fore, which means before, and sight, which means to
perceive. People often perceive things with their eyes: this is vision, or sight. But vision also
describes what someone thinks will happen. So foresight is planning for things before they happen.
