There is a tone to the word stagnant that sounds like what it is: lacking movement, stale, and
inactive, especially with exaggerated pronunciation, staaaagnant.

Stagnant came into use in the 17th century as a description for water or air that wasn't moving or
circulating, like in a scum-covered pond or a closed-off room. Often things that are stagnant also
have a smell from sitting too long in one place. Not that this happens to everyone, but sitting in
front of a TV playing video games without moving more than the fingers can make a person stagnant,
sometimes with an accompanying odor.
