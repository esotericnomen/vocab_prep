To vaunt is to brag and boast and flaunt and go on and on about how great something is. It's over-
the-top showing off, and when you taunt and exaggerate your greatness, you vaunt to the point of no
longer seeming so great.

From the Latin vānitāre — which comes from vānus, meaning vain or empty — vaunt is a verb for
taking praise too far or talking something up too much. Even if it's earned or deserved bragging,
vaunting about something gets old and loses it impact. Other times, vaunt, as a noun, is a sure sign
that a hard sell is going on — someone is talking big but can't deliver.
