Epistemology is the study of knowledge, so an epistemologist is someone who studies how we know
things. Want to know whether your friend’s crazy ideas came from observation or inspiration? Then
you are a budding epistemologist.

Epistemology is one of the classical branches of philosophy. Episteme is the Greek word for a piece
of knowledge, and -ology means study of. Epistemologists debate how we come to know things––how
much is innate, how much comes from sensory perception, how much is passed on to us as we grow
older. If you're curious about how the mind works, you should consider becoming an epistemologist.
