Behest is an authoritative command or request. If your boss or principal asks to see you, you go to
their office at their behest.

Behest rhymes with request and they almost mean the same thing, if you give your request a little
authoritative oomph, just a tad bit of or else. Another difference between these words is that you
can't use behest as a verb: You can't behest someone. You act according to their behest. The root
word here is the Old English hehaes, means a vow.
