A coup is a pretty major achievement, whether it involves taking over a government by force, or
landing a major business contract.

When the word coup is used on the nightly news, it's usually describing a military government
takeover. In the business section of the daily newspaper,  coup might refer to a big corporation
landing an important contract or deal. However you use the word coup, don't say the p at the end.
It's not pronounced like chicken coop. It sounds more like a dove's coo.
