Sniff, sniff, boo-hoo... use the adjective forlorn to express loneliness and feeling left out.

When someone is forlorn it means that they not only feel miserable but simultaneously desolate
because they also believe they are alone. Forlorn is a very old word in English, and in fact it
comes from the Old English word forlesen and means to lose completely. Synonyms for forlorn all have
fairly sad meanings: disconsolate, pessimistic, despairing, despondent, abandoned, depressed,
desperate.
