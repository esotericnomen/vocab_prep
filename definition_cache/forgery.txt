If you painted a copy of the Mona Lisa and sold it to a museum, claiming it was the original, your
painting could be called a forgery, and the crime you've committed is also forgery.

Forgery is a legal word describing a white-collar crime that could involve faking a famous painting,
making a false passport that claims you're the King of Swaziland, or copying your boss's signature
onto a document. Both the crime of forgery and the sense of forge that means to make or to sculpt
come from the Latin root word fabricare, or fabricate.
