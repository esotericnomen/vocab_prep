Pussy can be an affectionate term for a kitty-cat, a dirty word for a woman’s private parts, or an
adjective that describes something that contains pus — that oozing yellow stuff that comes out of
a cut.

You might have heard your elderly neighbor refer to her cat as a pussycat. And in her most tender
moments, you might have heard her in the yard, saying, “Here, pussy-pussy.” That’s because
pussy is another word for cat. It’s also a word for a woman’s genitals. Generally, it’s
considered offensive when it refers to a woman’s body. It’s probably not a word you should say
to your math teacher or your mother. Unless you’re talking about the neighbor’s cat.
