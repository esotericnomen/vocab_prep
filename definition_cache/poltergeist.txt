When you're home alone at night and hear a mysterious noise from above, it's much more likely to be
mice in your attic than a poltergeist, which is a noisy ghost.

You've probably come across poltergeists in scary movies and books, and with any luck you won't
encounter one in real life. Stories describe them as particularly disruptive ghosts, known for
making noise and throwing things around. The roots of the word poltergeist make perfect sense:
poltern means create a disturbance in German, and geist means ghost.
