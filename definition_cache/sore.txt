A sore is a broken patch of skin — something you might put a bandage on — or it's something that
gives you pain, like a sore throat, that’s red and scratchy and painful.

You can have a sore and you can also be sore: if you've just ridden your bike over the Alps, you're
probably pretty sore — achy and hurting all over. Maybe you've heard phrases like Don't be sore at
me, boss, from old gangster movies, meaning don't be angry. A sore point or a sore subject is
something you don't want to discuss, like the sensitive topic of your last history quiz, the one you
slept through.
