Use the adjective elaborate when you want to describe how something is very detailed or especially
complicated, like a devilish prank planned out weeks in advance.

The adjective elaborate is used to describe when something is planned with a lot of attention to
detail or when something is intricate or detailed itself. The word comes from the Latin elaborare,
which means to produce by labor but it has come to mean a lot of labor, especially work that is very
complicated and precise. To imagine this word, think of a painting with lots of flourishes or a
story with many sub-plots and characters that all fit together in extensive ways.
