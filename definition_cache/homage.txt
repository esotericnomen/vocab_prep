Homage means great respect and honor, or something done to honor a person or thing. We pay homage to
our ancestors and say prayers in homage to their memory.

In Middle English, homage specifically referred to respect for and loyalty to a feudal lord. The
word was borrowed from Old French, probably from omne, homme man, from Latin homĹ?. The noun suffix
â&euro;&ldquo;age is used to mean an action, process, result, or state.
