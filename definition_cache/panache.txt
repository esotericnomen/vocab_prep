To have panache is to have a stylish flair. You might wear your giant polka-dotted scarf with great
panache.

Panache comes from the Latin word pinnaculum, which means “small wing” or “tuft of
feathers.” When you decorate yourself with a flourish, have an elegant appearance, or do something
with style, you are said to have panache. You might wear your beret with new-found panache. Your
aunt Milly may throw a party with unmatched panache. Or you brother's ability to turn a phrase may
show an uncommon panache.
