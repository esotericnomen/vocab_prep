If someone asks you to do them a kindness, they mean a nice, kind act, the kind that makes you think
of puppies and daisies.

The noun kindness can be used for a kind act or to describe someone's temperament. You might say of
someone that her kindness is quite genuine, or on the other hand she fakes kindness to get what she
wants.
