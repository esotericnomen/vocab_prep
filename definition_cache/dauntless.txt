A dauntless person is someone who isn't easily frightened or intimidated. If your dance moves bring
to mind a marionette being jerked around by a five-year-old but you jump on the dance floor anyway,
you could be considered dauntless.

The adjective dauntless is a variant of the noun daunt, which means to intimidate or cause fear.
Both words are related to another family of D words â&euro;&rdquo; dominate, domestic, domain.
They all go back to the Latin root domare, which means to tame.  If you're dauntless, it means
you're like a tiger or a wild horse â&euro;&rdquo; you can't be dominated or tamed.
