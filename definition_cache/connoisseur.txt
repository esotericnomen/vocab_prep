A connoisseur is a person who, through study and interest, has a fine appreciation for something,
like the connoisseur who can identify the clarinet player on a jazz recording by the sound of his
inhalations alone.

A connoisseur is an authority in his field, someone who has expert knowledge and training,
especially in the arts. A connoisseur may also be someone with an extremely developed sense of
taste, like the connoisseur who can identify rare wine by a flavor others can't even detect. Then
again, some people call themselves connoisseurs of just about anything they like â&euro;&rdquo;
pizza, old vinyl albums, even cartoons â&euro;&rdquo; because they know so much about it.
