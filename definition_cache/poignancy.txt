The noun poignancy refers to something that is deeply touching, especially something that brings
forth strong emotions like sympathy, sadness, or sorrow. The poignancy of the movie may bring you to
tears. Bring tissues. Lots of tissues.

The noun poignancy is from the Old French word poindre, which means to prick or sting. Related words
include the adjective poignant. Similar words include pathos and bathos, although both of these
words often imply a sort artificiality that poignancy does not. Pathos can imply a trick by the
writer or speaker to produce sympathy or sadness and bathos can imply artificial sentimentality, so
poignancy is often the preferred word when genuine emotion is involved.
