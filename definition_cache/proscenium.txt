The proscenium of a theater stage is a structure in front of the stage that frames the action of the
play. It can be square or arched, and the stage curtain is generally directly behind it.

The ancient Greeks gave us the modern concept of theater and, with it, the proscenium, one of the
divisions of the stage. The word itself can be broken down into prō-, in front of, and skēnē,
scene: The proscenium is thus the part in front of the scenery. In a modern theater, the proscenium
makes up the so-called fourth wall, the invisible barrier that separates the stage from the audience
and through which the audience watches the action.
