When you blush, you turn red because you are embarrassed. And, oddly enough, women wear the make-up
variety of blush to add color to their cheeks — not to appear embarrassed but to appear
attractive.

Women use a type of makeup called blush to add redness to their cheeks. That can help you remember
the other meanings of this word, which all relate to redness or rosiness. When you have a blush —
or are blushing — your face gets red. People blush when they’re embarrassed. Having a crush can
cause blushing; so can getting caught stealing something. Blushing is caused by blood rushing to the
head: thus, the color red.
