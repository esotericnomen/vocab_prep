Emblazon means to inscribe conspicuously. If you are a knight and you are decorating your shield
with your coat of arms, you are emblazoning it.

If you are a graffiti artist and you paint your tag on a bridge, you are emblazoning the bridge. The
mother of a toddler might freak out if she comes into her freshly painted dining room to find it
emblazoned with her child's crayoned scribbling.
