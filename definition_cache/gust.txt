A gust is a strong, short burst of air. If you're walking around on a brisk, cold day, hold on to
your papers tightly — a gust of wind could sweep in and send your notes flying into the air.

You've probably seen the famous image of Marilyn Monroe standing on a sidewalk with her white dress
blowing in the breeze from a subway grate — that might be the most famous gust of air in popular
culture. Gust comes from the Old Norse word gustr, meaning a cold blast of wind. Gust also can be
used to describe other things that come on with a sudden burst, like  a violent gust of rain or an
unexpected gust of sadness.
