To steal is take something that isn't yours: thieves steal. But a bargain that's so good it's almost
like you're getting away with robbery is also called a steal.

Stealing is what thieves do: taking things from other people. A bank robber steals money. A mugger
steals purses and wallets. People also use steal in other ways. If someone wastes your time, you
might say they're stealing your time. A store having a sale might say, Our prices are a steal! In
baseball, a runner can steal a base. When you see steal, think take.
