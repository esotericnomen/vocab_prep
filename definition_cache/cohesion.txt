Cohesion means sticking together. If your group of friends heads to the lunchroom as a team and sits
all together, you're demonstrating strong cohesion.

Cohesion is a word that comes to us through physics, where cohesion describes particles that are the
same and tend to stick together Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; water molecules, for example. Outside of physics,
cohesion describes unity among parts, and is something to be sought after. A team that has good
cohesion is often a team that wins.
