Go to a fancy restaurant and take a look at the menu. If you decide to order the chicken, you've
just selected your entree.

Entree, pronounced ON-tray and sometimes spelled entrĂŠe, is another word for main course, at
least as it's usually used in this country. Sometimes people talk about having an entree into
society, or into some club. When it's used in those contexts, it usually means you have someone
who's going to smooth the way, introduce you, and allow you to enter.
