Defamation is a dirty trick against someone's reputation. If you were so furious at your friend that
you spread a rumor that he was still wetting his bed, that would be defamation of your friend.

The noun defamation describes something very mean and completely deliberate, essentially a false
accusation against someone or an attack on a person's good reputation. The terms libel and slander
â&euro;&rdquo; written or spoken lies about a person, group, or business â&euro;&rdquo; both fall
under the category of defamation. Sometimes defamation is even a punishable crime, and in every
instance it's unkind and malicious.
