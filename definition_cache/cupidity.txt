Remember the saying “Greed is good”? It could just as easily be “Cupidity is good,” though
admittedly it doesn’t roll off the tongue quite the same way. Cupidity means a burning desire to
have more wealth than you need.

Though it sounds like it might have something to do with the little winged figure who shoots arrows
and makes folks fall in love on Valentine’s Day, cupidity is all about the love of money. It comes
to us from Latin cupidus, which means desirous. It’s not a word that crops up a lot in
conversation, though you might run across it in newspapers and magazines, particularly those blaming
Wall Street’s unbridled cupidity for America’s economic woes.
