When you encounter something by chance that seems like it was meant to be, then it could be kismet,
your destiny.

The word kismet comes from the Arabic word ḳismat, meaning “division, portion, lot.” You can
think of kismet as your lot in life, or your fate. You’ll often hear the word used in relation to
something significant that came about entirely by chance. If you met the love of your life when you
spilled coffee on one another as you fell on the icy sidewalk of a street you never walked down
before, all you can do is smile and shrug and say, “Kismet.”
