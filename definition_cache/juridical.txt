If you decide you're interested in a juridical career, it means that you want a job working as a
judge or a lawyer.

Use the adjective juridical to describe something that's connected to the law. You could describe a
defendant in a trial as having a juridical advantage if all the evidence presented seems to be in
her favor; the juridical result might be that a jury finds her not guilty. The Latin root of
juridical is iuridicalis, or pertaining to justice, which in turn comes from ius, right or law, and
dicere, to speak.
