As a verb, filibuster means to obstruct legislation by talking at great length. As a noun, it can
refer to that oppositional speech. The Senator prevented a vote on the bill by reading the
dictionary from aardvark to zyzzyva.

As a parliamentary tactic, the filibuster dates back to at least the first century B.C.E. The rules
of the Roman Senate required that all business must be completed by nightfall, and, on more than one
occasion, the senator Cato the Younger spoke until dark to delay a vote. In the Parliament of the
United Kingdom, a minister may talk out a bill, but his speech must pertain to the bill. In the
United States, by contrast, a Senator may forestall action on a bill by speaking on any topic.
