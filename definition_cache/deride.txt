The verb deride means to show a low opinion of someone or something. The jerk would deride the other
kids on the bus by calling them names or pulling their hair until the driver decided to de-ride him
by kicking him off the bus.

To ride people is to get on their case or give them a hard time, and to deride is to do the same
with insulting language or poor treatment. Deride comes from the Latin root dērīdēre, meaning to
ridicule, to scorn, and it's often used to express dislike or even hatred. Criticizing something
with words is a common way to deride, and politicians often deride each other in their speeches
during election campaigns.
