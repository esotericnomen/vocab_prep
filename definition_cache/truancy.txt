If you pretend you're sick to stay home from school and then sneak out to a baseball game, that's
truancy, meaning it’s an unauthorized absence.

In Middle English, truant — the root of truancy — referred to a vagabond or an idler. That
meaning still holds true: if you’re accused of truancy, some may say you’re a vagabond or an
idler — meaning you’re shirking your duties. Truancy can refer to any absence without
permission, but it often refers to  being absent from school. If you stay home from school without
good reason, you might be hauled into the principal’s office to explain your truancy.
