A phalanx is a tightly knit group of people or things, like an army troop or a bunch of fans of the
same band.

Phalanx refers to any tightly formed group of soldiers or officers, and historically defines a body
of Macedonian infantry whose shields overlapped. From that sense, it came to mean any close-knit
group. Another definition of phalanx â&euro;&rdquo; any bone in a finger or toe â&euro;&rdquo;
also came out of the military sense: these bones work together closely, just like a military
phalanx. The plural for these bones is phalanges, while  the plural for the other senses is
phalanxes.
