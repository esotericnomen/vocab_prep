If get a call saying a company has decided to rescind your job offer, it's back to the classifieds
for you. Rescind is an official reversal.

Things that are rescinded: policies, court decisions, regulations, and official statements. What all
these examples have in common is that they are on the record. Also, rescind usually refers to
promises instead of tangible objects. You can't rescind a shirt a friend has borrowed from you, but
you can rescind your offer to loan them your jeans.
