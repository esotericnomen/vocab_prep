When you perforate something, you make a hole in it, like when you poke holes in a piece of aluminum
foil to let steam escape while something is cooking.

The word perforate has origins in the Latin word perforatus, the past participle of perforare,
meaning “to bore through.” When you perforate something that’s essentially what you do: you
bore through it, or punch a hole or holes in it like paper you perforate to fit the rings on your
binder, or a leather belt that has been perforated with holes so that you can buckle it.
