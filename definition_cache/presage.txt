A presage is a sign that something bad is about to happen, like when you get that queasy feeling in
your stomach because your mom found out you skipped band practice to go to the movies.

Presage, pronounced PREH-sige, can be a noun or a verb. As a noun, presage is a warning or omen of
bad things to come, like a strange quiet and stillness in the air, presage to the coming tornado. As
a verb, presage means making a prediction or giving a warning of what's to come, like a terrible
end-of-season football game's outcome game that presaged the struggles the team faced the next
season.
