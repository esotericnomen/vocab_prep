If you become a doctor who specializes in geriatrics, your patients will mainly be elderly people.

The medical branch of geriatrics focuses on the health issues and diseases of old age. A doctor who
specializes in this kind of medicine might be called a geriatric physician or a geriatrician.
Geriatrics was originally based on the word pediatrics, the medical care of children, and comes from
the Greek geron, which means old age or old man.
