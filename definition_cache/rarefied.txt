Use the adjective rarefied to describe things that are so stylish, smart, or moral that they seem
elevated above the ordinary, like the rarefied conversation of brilliant scholars.

To correctly pronounce rarefied, accent the first syllable: RARE-uh-fied. In addition to high-minded
conversation, the word rarefied can also describe the air in high elevations that has less oxygen,
like the rarefied air that can be challenging to mountain climbers. Sometimes the quality of
airlessness shades the other meaning of the word, implying that the rarefied world of elegant people
isn't comfortable to everyone.
