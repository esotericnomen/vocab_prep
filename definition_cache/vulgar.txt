Vulgar is a great word that combines a bunch of different meanings into one, chief among them:
crude, crass, common, uncouth, sometimes raunchy. It depends on who's saying it and why.

From the Latin vulgus, meaning the common people, vulgar is an adjective that can describe anything
from the sexually explicit to the merely ugly and crass. Many people believe that there's an
important difference between things that are sexually frank and things that are vulgar. Erotica can
be very beautiful and even highbrow, while pornography is crude and vulgar. My friend Arnie loves
the lights and glamour of Times Square, while Cintra finds all the bright-colored, corporate logos
to be vulgar.
