The adverb never means at no time, or not at all. If you're never going to win a Monopoly game
against your brother, you won't beat him next week, next year, or when you're both 80 years old.

Something that never happens didn't occur in the past and won't ever occur in the future, either.
Never is a blunt, absolute kind of word. If you wonder whether your dad will let you drive his BMW
some day, and he responds, That's never going to happen, you can forget about it. The Old English
root is nĂŚfre, a compound of ne, not or no, and ĂŚfre, ever.
