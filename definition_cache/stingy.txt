If you are looking to describe someone with a Scrooge or Grinch-like tendency to pinch his pennies,
then stingy can be your adjective of choice. Or, if you are looking to describe something you have
too little of — like a 43-second coffee break — you can use stingy as well.

The adjective stingy (pronounced with a soft g) is likely derived from the adjective stingy
(pronounced with a hard g), which means biting, sharp, or stinging. Although stingy is usually used
to describe an ungenerous or miserly person, stingy can also be used to describe a larger entity:
People were no longer able to buy homes due to the stingy lending policies of the banks.
