A diaspora is a large group of people with a similar heritage or homeland who have since moved out
to places all over the world.

The term diaspora comes from an ancient Greek word meaning to scatter about. And that's exactly what
the people of a diaspora do Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; they scatter from their homeland to places across the
globe, spreading their culture as they go. The Bible refers to the Diaspora of Jews exiled from
Israel by the Babylonians. But the word is now also used more generally to describe any large
migration of refugees, language, or culture.
