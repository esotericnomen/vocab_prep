A homily is a sermon or religious speech offering encouragement or moral correction. Isnâ€™t it
strange how sometimes, when you're struggling with something, a preacher comes on TV giving a homily
on that same problem?! Too bad it happens when you do bad stuff, too.

In many churches and lecture halls, a homily is just a short message on a religious topic or moral
issue that's meant to encourage those who hear it. Another type of homily, though, is one that's
judgmental or condemning. If you hear a homily and feel better afterward, even if it delivers hard
truths about right and wrong, you've heard an uplifting homily. One that leaves you mad and
frustrated, however, might make you need another homily on forgiveness and self-control.
