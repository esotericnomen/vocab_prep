Impalpable describes a feeling that, though real, you can’t logically explain. If you don't know
why you love peanut butter and banana sandwiches so much, maybe your reasons are impalpable.

If you’ve ever used the words “I can’t quite put my finger on it” to describe something that
you have observed but can't really explain, then you already have a good idea of what impalpable
means. Impalpable traces back to the Latin word palpabilis, meaning “that may be touched or
felt.” Combine that with the prefix im-, and the word gets its meaning of something that can’t
be perceived by normal senses.
