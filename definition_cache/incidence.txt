Incidence means the frequency with which something bad occurs. You’ll hear of “incidences of
cancer” or “incidences of war. You hope the incidence is decreasing, not increasing.

You might confuse incidence and incident. They sound similar, but incident refers only to something
that happened, not to the frequency with which it happens. After a car accident, the police file an
incident report, which is a fancy way of saying they write down what happened. Looking at these
reports grouped together can show you if the incidence of accidents at specific intersections in
town is on the rise.
