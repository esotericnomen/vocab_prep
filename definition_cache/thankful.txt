On Thanksgiving, we remember to be thankful, showing and feeling our thanks for the meal and company
in front of us.

When you are thankful, you're full of thanks. It's a word that expresses either a feeling or showing
of gratitude.  You can be thankful that the long week is over, or you can give a thankful smile to
your boss when she says you can leave a few hours early.
