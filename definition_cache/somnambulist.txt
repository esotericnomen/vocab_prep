If you ever find yourself standing in the backyard in your pajamas at 4:00 in the morning and
wondering how you got there, you may be a somnambulist â€” someone who walks in her sleep.

In Roman mythology, Somnus was the god of sleep; the Greeks called him Hypnos. His mother was Night
(Nix) and his brother was Death (Thanatos).  He lived in a dark cave and presumably never had to get
up in time for school.
