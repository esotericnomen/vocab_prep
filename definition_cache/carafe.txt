Wine is often served in a carafe, a flask, usually of glass or metal, with a wide mouth. It usually
presents a more elegant way to serve than using the wine's original bottle or — heavens! — box.

While carafes have been used since very early times, the word itself came through Spanish, Italian,
and French, probably from the Arabic word gharrafa ladle, scoop. It entered English by 1786.
