Anything superficial has to do with the surface of something. If you're judging a book by its cover,
you're being superficial. People who worry too much about their clothes and hair may also be
considered superficial.

The word superficial has to do with appearances and the surface. If a car is in an accident, but it
only has a few scratches, you could say it has superficial damage, because the important parts are
OK. If you just glanced at a movie for a second, your opinion will be more superficial than someone
who watched the whole thing closely. Superficial can have a negative flavor; calling someone
superficial is saying that they are shallow and care too little about meaningful things.
