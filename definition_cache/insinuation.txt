An insinuation is a sly way of saying something, usually something insulting. It can also be a way
of worming your way into a group or situation.

You're dumb! is an insult. An insinuation is different: it's a way of indirectly saying something.
Insinuation evolved from the Latin insinuationem, meaning entrance through a narrow way.Ã¢&euro;?
So an insinuation is like an insult that sneaks in the back door. Mentioning that your cousin could
try harder in school could be an insinuation that your cousin's lazy. Another kind of insinuation is
when someone, often through flattery, gets herself accepted by others. Both kinds of insinuations
are sneaky.
