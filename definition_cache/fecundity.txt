Fecundity means fruitfulness and fertility, the ability to produce abundant healthy growth or
offspring.

What a wonderful word fecundity is! It refers to a powerful productivity, usually in the area of
natural growth, either from the earth or by human reproduction. But it can also be used to describe
great mental ability and creativity, the ability to create intellectual products. In any case,
fecundity has a positive sense, suggesting healthy growth of life-forms and mental abilities.
