What's a retort? It's a reply that's short. Why did the monkey fall out of the tree; please give me
a report? I said The monkey's dead, with a dry retort.

Today retort is used as both a noun and a verb, and both come from 16th- and 17th-century sources
meaning to twist, turn back. A retort is a comeback or a quick and clever answer or remark. It can
be a form of payback when someone tries to insult or tease another person, and often, a perfect
retort doesn't occur to you till later, when you think Oh! I wish I had said that earlier!
