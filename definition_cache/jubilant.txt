If you were the quarterback that threw the touchdown pass that won the Super Bowl, you would be
jubilant: filled with joy.

When you feel jubilant, you√¢&euro;&trade;re full of extreme happiness. Usually people are jubilant
after great victories, whether in sports, politics, or life. When you're jubilant, it's a moment of
extreme happiness, like giving birth or watching a child graduate. There can also be jubilant songs,
jubilant performances, even jubilant periods in history, times when people are especially proud and
filled with triumph. The end of World War II was just such a jubilant moment.
