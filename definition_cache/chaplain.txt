A chaplain is usually a religious leader — a minister, rabbi, or other clergy member — who works
outside of a church or temple.

You can use the word chaplain to describe the minister who counsels patients at your local hospital.
Or, a chaplain could also be a priest who lives and works with soldiers on a battlefield (a military
chaplain). These days, many chaplains are non-denominational, not associated with any particular
religion. The Latin root word, cappellanus, means clergyman.
