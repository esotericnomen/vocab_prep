A dichotomy is an idea or classification split in two. When you point out a dichotomy, you draw a
clear distinction between two things.

A dichotomy is a contrast between two things. When there are two ideas, especially two opposed ideas
â&euro;&rdquo; like war and peace, or love and hate â&euro;&rdquo; you have a dichotomy. You often
hear about a false dichotomy, which occurs when a situation is unfairly represented as an either/or
scenario. For example, the statement All cars are either small and efficient or large and polluting
creates a false dichotomy because there are some cars that don't fit into either category.
