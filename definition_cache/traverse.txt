The verb traverse means to travel across an extended area. Her dream was to traverse the country by
car, so she could meet new people and see all the kitschy sites â€” like the giant roadside tire in
Michigan or the shoe house in Pennsylvania.

The verb traverse can also mean to span, to span a physical space or time. The bridge traversed the
river, linking the two cities. Traverse can be used for any crossing, but it often is used when
implying the crossing will be difficult. She was exhausted from traveling in the snowy conditions,
but she still had to traverse an icy bridge before she would arrive safely home.
