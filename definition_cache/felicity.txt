Felicity is a state of happiness or the quality of joy. Sitting on the roof with a telescope and
iced tea on a clear, starry night is one way to find perfect felicity — a happy place.

Felicity comes from the Latin fēlīcitās, meaning happiness. A synonym for felicity is
blissfulness. People, places, and things can have felicity: His personality was so warm and full of
felicity that we felt at ease the minute we met him. Or you can be in a state of felicity: A full
stomach, a fluffy couch, and the felicity of a Sunday-afternoon nap.
