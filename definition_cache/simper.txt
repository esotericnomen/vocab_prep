To simper means to smile in an artificial, coy or self-conscious way. If you hope to please someone
by simpering, you may wind up annoying him or her.

The origin of the word simper is not clear, but it is probably Germanic as there are similar words
in Danish as well as Middle Dutch. What is clear is that a simper is not attractive to those
observing it. Watching your colleague simper and giggle as the boss tells a not-very-funny joke, you
can be sure that she is angling for that promotion.
