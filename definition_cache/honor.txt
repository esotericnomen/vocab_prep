Honor has many uses, all of them good. If you are called a man of honor, you are respected. If
someone honors you, they recognize and award you for your achievements.

The term honor has always been a word used to describe men and women of high moral worth or great
achievement. It can be used as either a noun or verb, and in many different settings. People
graduate from college with honor, meaning they have outstanding grades. A woman of honor is pure and
decent. Soldiers are buried with full military honors, which means they are given gun salutes and
trumpet calls and the nation's fullest respect.
