A scourge is a whip â€” or anything else that is punishing and dreadful. You could confront a
scourge of corruption or a scourge of hunger.

As a verb, scourge means to cause suffering. Not surprisingly, it comes from the old French word
meaning to whip. A dictatorship could scourge and oppress its citizens, and an infectious disease
could scourge an entire community. When you see scourge, think suffering.
