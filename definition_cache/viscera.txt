If someone calls you a gutless coward, he's telling you that you lack both courage and viscera. Your
viscera are your innards or your guts. In popular usage the term refers to the intestines, but
technically it includes all soft internal organs.

Viscera comes from the Latin viscus, meaning an inner part of the body. You won't hear it much
nowadays unless you're studying anatomy or describing particularly gory special effects. (Parents
object to ultra-violent videogames where bodies explode, spewing viscera.) Don't confuse it with the
related visceral, which does crop up often today and means instinctive. She had a visceral reaction
to seeing her boyfriend and his hunting pals covered in deer blood and viscera, and dumped him the
next day.
