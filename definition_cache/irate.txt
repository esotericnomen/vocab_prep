On the anger scale, first comes annoyed, then cross, then furious, then irate. When cartoon
characters are irate smoke comes out of their ears. Use this word only when someone is so mad they
scare you.

The first syllable of irate is ir for ire, related to the Greek word oistros which means thing
causing madness. When you are irate, you are so angry, you're actually kind of crazy. An irate
investor might sell all his or her stock in a company. Let's hope you thanked your aunt for the
birthday check Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; otherwise you might get an irate phone call from her. When your
mother is irate, you'd best get out of the way, and get busy cleaning your room.
