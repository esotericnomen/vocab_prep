A mantle is a word for something that blankets over something else, like the loose cloak worn by
Little Red Riding Hood or the layer of earth between the crust and core.

Mantle is something that envelops and covers, like a tree covered in a mantle of snow. The Spanish
writer Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra said, â&euro;&oelig;Blessings on him who invented sleep, the
mantle that covers all human thoughts.â&euro;? Here, sleep is described as a mantle blanketing over
the mind. Mantel is a variation of mantle, but it very specifically describes the shelf above a
fireplace.
