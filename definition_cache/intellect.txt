Intellect is how much intelligence you have. Einstein was known for having a great intellect. Mickey
Mouse's friend Goofy has almost no intellect to speak of.

Intellect is the mental equivalent of athletic ability or fashion sense, so someone is an intellect
if they have great intellectual ability just as an athlete is someone who has great athletic
ability.  Intellect is something everyone has in some degree. If someone talks down to you, it's an
insult to your intellect. Your teacher might say you have a sharp intellect if you have the
intellect to figure out  difficult problems. An intellectual is a person who has a lot of knowledge
and prefers to think about things on an abstract or theoretical level rather than a practical one.
