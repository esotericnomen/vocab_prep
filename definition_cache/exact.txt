If something's exact it means it's precise and completely accurate — as opposed to a guess, an
estimate or an approximation.

Exact also has the meaning of taking something from someone, often money, and generally only given
up with reluctance under the threat of force. The Mob might exact a shakedown from unfortunate
businessmen, for example. The word comes from the Latin exactus exact or accurate, a form of the
verb exigere — meaning to force out or demand, like the Mob demanding its money.
