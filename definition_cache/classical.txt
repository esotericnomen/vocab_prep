Has the building got columns in front of it? Check. Has the music got lots of strings and horns?
Check. Chances are both are classical â€” representative of a past culture.

Often classical describes anything from ancient Greek or Roman culture, because, boy, those guys
were good. Be careful when using classical and classic; they're not exactly the same. While
something classical is usually a classic, it doesn't necessarily work the other way around. A
classic is something  exceptional that we tend to judge in a different time frame. A classic rock
album? Definitely not made by the ancient Greeks or Romans. So far as we know.
