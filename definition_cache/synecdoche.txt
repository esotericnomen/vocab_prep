A synecdoche is a simpler symbol that captures the essence of something more complicated. For
example, a family sitting at a table, each silently sending text messages is a synecdoche for the
struggle to balance technology with personal interaction.

To correctly pronounce synecdoche, say sih-NECK-duh-key. A synecdoche is a part that represents the
whole. A photograph of a car that is completely covered in snow is a synecdoche for the burden
everyone faces following a big winter storm. Synecdoche is a great literary device, especially for
poets who strive to express a great deal in a single image.
