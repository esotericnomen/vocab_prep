Use the verb tergiversate when you need a fancy way to describe someone who's beating around the
bush, or being deliberately unclear.

A politician who really doesn't want to answer a reporter's question is likely to tergiversate, or
talk and talk without ever taking a definitive stand. Your relatives may even tergiversate at
holiday gatherings when uncomfortable topics come up. The Latin root word, tergiversari, literally
means to turn one's back, or more figuratively, to be evasive.
