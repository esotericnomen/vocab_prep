Havoc is a noun that means devastation or total mayhem. Havoc often wreaked by hurricanes, angry
mobs, plundering Vikings, and wild parties that get out of control.

If we trace havoc way back, we arrive at a crossroads. Some people believe that the word comes from
the Old French havot, meaning “plundering, devastation,” while others argue that it was passed
down to us from the Latin habere, meaning “to have, possess.” Either way you look at it, the
meaning remains the same: widespread disorder or destruction.
