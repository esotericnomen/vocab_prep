A narrative is a story that you write or tell to someone, usually in great detail. A narrative can
be a work of poetry or prose, or even song, theater, or dance.

Often a narrative is meant to include the whole story. A summary will give a few key details and
then the narrative will delve into the details. I hate to interrupt your narrative, is a polite way
of stopping someone in the middle of a story. The origin of this noun is the Latin adjective
narrativus, from narrare to tell, from gnarus knowing. It is related to our English verb know.
