A protuberance is something that sticks out, like a swelling or a lump, like a bunion on your foot.
A protuberance doesn’t have to be hideous; it could be your nose on your face or a knot on a tree.

The late Latin word prōtūberāre meant to swell, coming from the prefix pro, which means forward,
and the root word tūber, meaning swelling. And root word is appropriate here, since a tuber is a
thick, fleshy part of a root, like a potato. And that should help you remember how to spell the word
protuberance. Don't you love it when a word's meaning and its spelling work together?
