If you and your friends launch into singing “Old MacDonald” loudly together, in the middle of
the public library, you will all have made a concerted, or cooperative, effort to annoy lots of
people.

Concerted is often used to describe a group effort to achieve a particular goal. As you may have
guessed, concerted comes from the word concert. While a concert can be defined as a group of
musicians playing cooperatively, concert can also designate other types of cooperative behavior. If
a group of people do anything together — from singing an annoying song to throwing library books
at agreed-upon targets — they are acting in concert, or in a concerted manner.
