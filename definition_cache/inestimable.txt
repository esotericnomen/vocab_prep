If something is so big you can’t even guess at its size, you’d call it inestimable.  It can
describe physical size (the inestimable universe) or a degree of something (your inestimable
handsomeness with that new haircut).

The prefix in- means “not,” and estimable has the same root as the word estimate, which means to
take an educated guess.  Sometimes a thing is so great that you cannot even guess.  A tsunami causes
inestimable destruction.  You’d need to travel inestimable miles to reach the edge of the
universe.  The love you have for your pet raccoon is inestimable, but the number of times she gets
into your trash every week is quite estimable.
