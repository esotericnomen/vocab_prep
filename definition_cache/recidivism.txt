Recidivism means going back to a previous behavior, especially criminal behavior. People that work
with prisoners are always hoping to lower recidivism rates.

The word recidivism comes from the Latin root words re, meaning back, and caedere, meaning to fall
Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; or literally to fall back. The word is most commonly used to discuss the relapse
rate of criminals, who have served their sentence and have been released. However, it can be used
for any relapse in behavior. Alcoholics who do not receive support are more prone to recidivism than
those in recovery programs, such as Alcoholics Anonymous.
