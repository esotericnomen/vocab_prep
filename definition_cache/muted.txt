Something muted has a softened tone or quieted sound. When you try to listen through the wall at
what someone is saying, it's really muted and mumbly, even if you put a glass to your ear.

When you mute the TV or computer speakers, all of the sound goes quiet, but something described as
muted is just toned down or turned down. When you whisper you speak in a muted voice; it's not
completely quiet or no one would hear you, but it's quiet enough to muffle the sounds or secrets you
share. Muted colors don√¢&euro;&trade;t stand out as much as bright ones. Beiges and soft grays are
muted, and they're great for showing off bright contrasts like a turquoise scarf or red tie.
