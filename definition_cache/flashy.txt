To be flashy is to be showy in a tasteless way. Just like a flash of light is hard to ignore, flashy
behavior draws attention.

Do you know anyone who is a show-off? That person is probably flashy. Wearing brightly colored rings
is flashy. Buying a sports car is flashy. Boasting about how much money you have is flashy. Flashy
behavior is the opposite of classy: it consists of showing off things in a loud, obnoxious way.
