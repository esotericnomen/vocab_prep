If you're someone who speaks before you think, you may need to recant, or take back, that overly
honest assessment of your friend's new haircut.

Recant comes from two Latin roots: the prefix re-, meaning back, and the verb cantare, meaning to
sing. It has been suggested that recant was first used when someone reversed a charm, curse, or some
other type of magical spell that would have been chanted or sung.  Regardless of whether this is
true or not, we suggest that you refrain from singing when you need to recant â&euro;&rdquo; unless
you've been casting nasty spells on people.
