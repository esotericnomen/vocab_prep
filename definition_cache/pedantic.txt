There's nothing wrong with focusing on the details, but someone who is pedantic makes a big display
of knowing obscure facts and details.

Pedantic means like a pedant, someone who's too concerned with literal accuracy or formality.  It's
a negative term that implies someone is showing off book learning or trivia, especially in a
tiresome way. You don't want to go antique-shopping with a pedantic friend, who will use the
opportunity to bore you with his in-depth knowledge of Chinese porcelain kitty-litter boxes.
