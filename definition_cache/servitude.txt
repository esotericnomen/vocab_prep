If you're free-spirited you won't enjoy servitude, mainly because servitude means you have to answer
to a master, like a servant does.

Slavery, a brutal form of servitude, existed in the United States until the ratification of the
Thirteenth Amendment in 1865. Before this, thousands upon thousands of African Americans were forced
into servitude, where they were forced to perform labor for their masters. A key to remembering the
meaning of servitude is the fact that it resembles servant.    If your friend rear-ends you but
doesn't have insurance, let him pay for the damage in servitude. Make him your personal assistant
for a month!
