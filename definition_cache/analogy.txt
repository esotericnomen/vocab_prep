When you draw an analogy between two things, you compare them for the purpose of explanation. The
movie character Forest Gump made a silly analogy famous: Life is like a box of chocolates.

Some standardized tests still have analogy questions, which are given in this format: A : B :: C :
___ (read A is to B as C is to what?). This is a more formalized version of something we do every
day: compare one thing to another. It's a useful way of speaking Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; if a scientist
explains that the earth's forests function as its lungs, we understand  the analogy to mean that
both trees and lungs take in important elements from the air. But when Forrest Gump says life is
like a box of chocolates because you never know what you're going to get, that's a pretty brainless
analogy.
