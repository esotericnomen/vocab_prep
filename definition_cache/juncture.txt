A juncture is a crucial point in time when a decision must be made. At this juncture, a president
might say, the government must decide whether to go ahead with war or to try to solve things
diplomatically.

A juncture is a joint or connection between two things. Originally used in the physical sense, it
has broadened in meaning to refer to an often urgent decision-making crossroads. At some point you
and your boyfriend will reach a critical juncture and have to decide whether to get serious or break
up. It can also simply mean point in time. She had never learned how to drive and at this juncture,
she knew she never would.
