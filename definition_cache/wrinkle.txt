If you work to iron a stubborn wrinkle out of your shirt, you're trying to smooth out a crease. A
wrinkle is a dent or line where that smoothness is interrupted.

You might fret about a wrinkle in your skirt or a new wrinkle on your face. Another kind of wrinkle
is more figurative: a small complication or problem that arises suddenly. You could describe a
torrential rain storm as a wrinkle in your plan to film a sunny scene in your movie, for example.
The Old English root is gewrinclod, wrinkled, crooked, or winding, and it comes from the verb
wrinclian, to wind.
