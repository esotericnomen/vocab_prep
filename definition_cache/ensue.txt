If something happens after something else, it will ensue, meaning it will follow after or be the
result. When a sneeze comes out, and he hears the Achoo!, a Bless you or Gesundheit soon will ensue.

One way to remember the verb ensue is to rhyme it with due. A happening that is due to happen will
ensue, Throwing a glass of ice water in his face guaranteed that a chase would ensue. Often what
follows is a response to words or actions, so what will ensue is what will happen as a consequence.
A struggle might ensue if a thief grabs a purse, and a discussion might ensue if two sides disagree.
