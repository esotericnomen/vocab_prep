Theology is the study of religion, plain and simple.  Of course, religion isn’t simple, so
theology covers a lot of subjects, like rituals, divine beings, the history of religions, and the
concept of religious truth.

Theology is taught to priests and ministers so they can better understand their religion, and it’s
also taught in non-religious colleges to anyone who is curious about the ideas and effects of
religion.  The first half of theology is theo-, which means god in Greek. The suffix -logy means
“the study of,” so theology literally means “the study of god, but we usually expand it to
mean the study of religion more broadly.
