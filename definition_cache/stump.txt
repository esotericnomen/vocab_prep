There are three ways to stump: you can ask someone a question they can't answer, you can travel
making political speeches, or you can stomp.

Stump can mean many things as a verb. The most common use is when someone â&euro;&rdquo; like a
teacher â&euro;&rdquo; asks a question that no one can answer. That's a case of the teacher
stumping the class. Also, politicians traveling through a district, making speeches are stumping,
giving what are called stump speeches. Once in a while, to stump means the same thing as two similar
words, stomp and stamp. If you're stumping, stomping, and stamping around, you're making a lot of
noise with your feet.
