If you want to buy a car but don't have money, you'll need a loan: a sum of money given temporarily
that must be repaid, often with interest, or an added percentage on top the original sum.

You can loan money or objects. If you loan someone your car, make sure he's a good driver. You might
loan your friend a sweatshirt if she's cold and doesn't have one. Expect to get both your car and
your sweatshirt back. A word that is borrowed from another language is called a loanword, like the
word karaoke, which is Japanese.
