Exertion is effort. Exercise requires physical exertion. Listening to great jazz requires mental
exertion. What kind of exertion does jazzercise require? Perhaps too much.

Ex– means out. Exertion means energy is coming out—so much so that when you’re done, you may
feel exhausted. The opposite of ex- is in-, as in inertia—something you need exertion to overcome.
