To incorporate is to include or integrate a part into the whole. Incorporate is a more active
version of the word include; if you incorporate, you are adding something to the mix.

In the business world, to incorporate is a legal process. In other usages, the word incorporate
really just means to include something or work something into whatever was already existing. You
could incorporate your new roommate's furniture into the decor of your apartment, but you may not
find a way to incorporate her cat's litter box.
