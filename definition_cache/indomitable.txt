Something indomitable can't be beat. People described as having indomitable spirits don't need pep
talks or protein shakes; their strength comes from within.

The adjective indomitable starts with the Latin prefix in, which means not. The second part of the
word is also from the Latin word domitare, meaning to tame. So the word literally means not able to
be tamed. Indomitable is often teamed with the words spirit or personality to describe someone with
a can-do attitude.
