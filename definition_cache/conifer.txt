A conifer is a type of tree that produces cones and evergreen needles. Spot a pile of cones beneath
a tree and you've found yourself a conifer.

With the word cone embedded in it, it's no surprise that conifer is the term used for cone-producing
trees. Conifers can often be identified by their typically long needle-shaped leaves like the kind
you find on a Christmas tree. Mostly found in northern forests where the winters are cold, the tough
prickly leaves on conifers make them adaptable to the weather.
