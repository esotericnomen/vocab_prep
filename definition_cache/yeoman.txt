A yeoman was a farmer who owned and worked his own land â€” not to be confused with yo, man!

Although experts aren't entirely sure of the origin of yeoman, they speculate that it is a shortened
version of young man. Yeoman is now just a historic term and it is unlikely to be used to describe a
landowning farmer today. There are modern uses for the word, however, including in the U.S. Navy,
the Royal Navy, a Yeoman of the Guard, and similar military terms.
