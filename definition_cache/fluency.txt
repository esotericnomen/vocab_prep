Do you have a way with words? Can you speak and write easily? Then you have fluency.

Fluency is a type of smoothness used most often when talking about language. You could study a
language — like Spanish — for years and not really gain fluency. To have fluency — in other
words, to be fluent — takes a lot of practice. Fluency can't be achieved overnight. That kind of
expert use of language takes time, and it helps if you get a chance to visit a country where they
speak the language you're learning.
