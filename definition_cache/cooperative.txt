As an adjective, cooperative describes working together agreeably for a common purpose or goal as in
cooperative play or cooperative employee.

As a noun, a cooperative is a jointly-owned business or enterprise where members pool their
resources to purchase, do work,  and/or distribute things. You might join a food cooperative, for
example, which jointly purchases a farmer's labor and then every member gets a basket of fresh
fruits and vegetables each week of the growing season. In this use, the word is often shortened to
co-op. You might also join a housing cooperative where you own your apartment and you and the other
owners jointly care for the upkeep of the building and grounds.
