Degradation is the act of lowering something or someone to a less respected state. A president
resigning from office is a degradation. It’s also a downcast state. Once the president has
resigned, he might feel degradation.

The noun degradation is related to the verb degrade, which comes from the Latin degradare. Degradare
comes from de-, meaning “down,” and gradus, meaning step. You can think of a degradation as a
step down, or feeling as though you’re a step below.
