Effects are portable personal property not used for business. We most often hear this word in
reference to one's personal effects.

The noun effects was first used in 1704 to mean goods and property. It's your personal stuff, like
keys, fine china collection, watch, car, or earrings. Personal effects is a phrase often associated
with a last will and testament, when someone bequeaths certain items (or items in general) to
someone else, but it can also refer to the belongings you remove from your pockets and fork over
when you go to jail (which you'll then get back when you leave).
