If something's canonical, it follows a principle or rule, usually in a religious or church-related
situation. It is also used in mathematics, music and can refer to something reduced to its most
basic form.

The word canonical is from the root canon, with both evolving from the Latin cononicus, or according
to rule, a meaning applied to religion during the Middle Ages. However, the definition of rules also
applies in other areas as well. In mathematics, the word is used to describe an equation reduced to
its most basic form. In canonical music, a melody line is repeated at intervals throughout a piece.
Perhaps the most familiar of these is Pachebel's Canon in D.
