Defrock comes from frock, an old word for dress. Priests, nuns, monks, and other church officials
wear a frock to symbolize their job. If they leave the church, they are said to be defrocked: their
gown is taken away.

Although it is still common to refer to defrocked priests (priests who have left the priesthood for
one reason or another), the word does not have a generally-used meaning outside of the clergy. You
would not refer to a defrocked teacher or a defrocked coach.
