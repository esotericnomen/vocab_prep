Sometimes, maybe for no reason at all, you might become agitated with a feeling of restless
agitation. This feeling is a sense of disquietude, an edgy feeling that something in your universe
is out of order.

If you break down the word disquietude you come to its root word, quiet, which means still or
noiseless. The dis- prefix means not, giving it the opposite meaning, and the ending -tude makes it
a state of being. So the word literally means state of being unquiet. For example, it was said in
the Washington Post that the 19th-20th-century artist Edward Hopper's paintings present a picture of
the disquietude, or uneasiness, of American life.
