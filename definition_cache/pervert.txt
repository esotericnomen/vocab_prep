A pervert is a person who doesn't behave normally, often when it comes to sex: perverts pervert the
accepted rules of society.

The most common use of pervert is as a word for people who are deviant sexually: that could mean a
lot of things, ranging from being kinky to being dangerous, such as pedophiles. Perverting also
means changing or subverting something. A cop who breaks the law is perverting the law. A criminal
who convinces other people to become criminals is perverting them. So when you think of pervert,
think change Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; change for the worse.
