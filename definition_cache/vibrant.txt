Vibrant colors are bright. Vibrant sounds are loud and resonant. Vibrant people are ones you
remember––they're bright and full of personality.

Vibrant was originally intended to describe sounds. Sound waves vibrate, and when they vibrate more
rapidly, they sound brighter. Singers and string instrument players increase this effect by shaking
the notes they play through a technique called vibrato that increases the vibrancy of their sound.
