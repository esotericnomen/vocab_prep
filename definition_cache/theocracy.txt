When religious doctrine is the law of the land, most likely you're living in a theocracy. There's
not a lot of room for dissent in theocracies, where priests are in charge and say they are speaking
for God.

Notice the similarities between theocracy and democracy? In Greek, theo- means God and  -kratia
power or rule. A democracy is ruled by dÄ“mos, the people. An autocracy is one ruled by a single
person with absolute power, like a king (or your mom). In theocracies, God rules.
