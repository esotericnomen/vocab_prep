Flotsam is the floating wreckage of a ship. You'll often hear it used with jetsam which is floating
objects that have been thrown from a ship, usually to lighten it before it sinks.

You can keep flotsam and jetsam straight by remembering that flotsam looks like the word, float, and
jetsam looks like jettison which means to cast off. Usually it doesn't matter though as flotsam and
jetsam are used together as an expression, mostly figuratively to mean to mean things or people who
are unwanted or discarded. What about the things that are cast from a ship but sink to the ocean
floor instead of floating? That's called lagan.
