Mimicry is the art of imitation, which is practiced the world over, from annoying siblings who
repeat every word you say, to professional comedians who impersonate famous people onstage.

Mimicry comes from a Greek word for mime: a performer who silently imitates gestures and
expressions. Usually mimicry refers to imitation that is meant to make fun of the thing imitated,
often in an unkind way. Think of the class clown’s mimicry of your French teacher’s overly
precise accent. It entertained the class, but got him sent to the principal’s office.
