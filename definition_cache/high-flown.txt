A person is considered high-flown if he tries to sound smarter or fancier than he really is.

The adjective high-flown particularly comes in handy when you're describing overblown, pretentious
writing. You can also describe overly lofty plans as high-flown: The six year-old's intention to
build a tree house with wall-to-wall carpeting, electric lights, and plumbing seemed a little high-
flown to me.
