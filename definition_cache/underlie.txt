While it’s true that when something underlies something else, it is beneath it, this does not
necessarily mean subservience — it can also indicate a strong foundation or bedrock that
underlies, or supports, an idea or decision.

The Old English word underlicgan meant to serve or submit to another, and that meaning does carry
through to the modern word underlie — to a point. Although still referring to something under
something else, around 1850 the meaning of the verb shifted to include something that makes a
foundation for something else. For example, one factor that underlies a patient's unusual symptoms
might be his recent trip to a foreign country, where he could have picked up a local infection.
