You reduce something when you lessen its volume, size, or degree. That's why we say when someone
goes on a diet, it's because they want to reduce; it's a polite way of suggesting they need to drop
pounds and become a smaller size.

The word reduce first appeared in Old French during the 14th Century, when it meant bring back. From
the Latin re, which meant back, coupled with ducere, meaning bring or lead Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; we ended
up with reduce. The current meaning, to lessen, appeared in the late 1700's, drawn from the word's
military use, reduce to ranks, which meant break into smaller units.  Cooks use the word reduce when
they reduce a liquid, boiling it down until it has less volume and is thicker.
