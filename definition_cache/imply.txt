Imply means to express, suggest, or show something without stating it directly: A friend’s gruff
manner would imply that she’s in a foul mood.

The verb imply comes from a Latin word meaning “enfold or entangle” but has come to mean “to
hint at.” You might imply something that you don’t want to outright say if you’re feeling coy.
If you don’t call someone back after she leaves eight messages, you imply that you don’t want to
chat. When you make a subtle suggestion, you imply.
