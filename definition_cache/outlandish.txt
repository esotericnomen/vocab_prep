If something is outlandish it's bizarre or unfamiliar, far outside the boundaries of expected or
normal behavior. Driving around the city in a golf cart and eating spaghetti with pineapple sauce
are both examples of outlandish behavior.

It's easy to imagine how the word outlandish originated. The Old English root is utland, which
literally means out-land, or foreign.  Now, it would be inappropriate to refer to a foreigner as
outlandish, unless, say, he shows up to the office in a red patent-leather Speedo and a ten-gallon
hat.
