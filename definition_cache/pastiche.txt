The next time you see a movie that you think is a cheap imitation of an older, better movie, you can
sound like a film critic by dismissing the picture as a thoughtless pastiche.

A pastiche is an artwork that copies the style of another work or that combines various, distinct
styles together into one work. A pastiche can also be a musical medley, or the piecing together of
various songs. Pastiche comes from the Italian word pasticcio, which can refer to a pie containing a
mix of ingredients, such as meat and pasta.
