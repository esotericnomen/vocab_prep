Extemporaneous means spoken without preparation. The orator's performance was impressive, but only
after we learn that his speech was extemporaneous did we realize the true depth of his talent.

Some politicians are so skilled that even their prepared remarks have an extemporaneous quality. As
opposed to policy debates where teams know the resolution in advance, extemporaneous  debate is
judged on style and nimble argumentation, as the participants receive the resolution minutes before
debating begins.
