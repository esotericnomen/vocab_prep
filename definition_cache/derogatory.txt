Something that's derogatory is insulting or disrespectful. If you make derogatory comments, that
means you say things that are unflattering, unkind, or demeaning.

Derogatory means about the same as insulting. Derogatory language is meant to hurt, and it usually
does. If you feel offended or insulted by what someone says, the person probably said something
derogatory. Racial, sexist, and homophobic slurs are all derogatory. Insults that mean someone is
stupid or crazy are derogatory. Making a joke about someone's mother is derogatory.
