People who pull pranks, make jokes, and do things that annoy other people — but aren't really
awful — are good at mischief.

Mischief is a word for things that are a little bad or reckless but ultimately harmless. Hitting
someone with a spitball is mischief. Hitting them with a rock is dangerous and therefore much worse
than mischief. Making mischief can be fun, as long as it doesn't get out of hand. People who do a
lot of mischief are called mischievous.
