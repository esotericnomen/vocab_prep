A creature that lives off another organism is a parasite. The parasite might not hurt the host, but
it doesn't do anything to help it, either.

If you call someone a parasite, you are really hurling an insult! The Ancient Greeks used the word
parasitos to describe someone who ate at your table but never invited you back. Some telling
synonyms include leech, toady, sponge, and hanger-on. Nice, huh? Some crafty birds, such as the
cowbird or cuckoo, are called social parasites, laying their eggs in other birds' nests and
expecting those mamas to raise their young for them. Unfortunately, there are some people like that,
too.
