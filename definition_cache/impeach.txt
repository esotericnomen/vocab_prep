Impeach means to charge someone with doing something wrong, specifically a high government official,
such as the US president, a senator, or a Federal judge. Fortunately, very few presidents have had
the dishonor of being impeached.

Impeach comes from the Latin impedicare catch, entangle. If you can remember that impeach is closely
related to impede, which means to slow or hinder, all you have to think of is, Stop, thief! to
remember that impeach has to do with crime and not with stone fruit.
