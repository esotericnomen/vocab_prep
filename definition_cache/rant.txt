A rant is an argument that is fueled by passion, not shaped by facts. When the shouting starts on
talk radio, or when a blog commenter resorts to ALL CAPS — you're almost certainly encountering an
instance of ranting.

Rant comes from the Dutch ranten, to talk nonsense. Rave is a close synonym — in fact, to rant and
rave is a popular expression. When rant is used as a noun, it means something like tirade. The first
recorded usage of rant is from the end of the sixteenth century, in Shakespeare's The Merry Wives of
Windsor. By the middle of the turbulent seventeenth century, the name Ranters was used as a catchall
pejorative for various groups of radical Christian dissenters.
