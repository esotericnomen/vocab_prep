Picture an old man banging his fist on the dinner table, inveighing against the evils of teenagers
being allowed to listen to music and dance. Inveigh means to rail against something with hostility
and passion.

Related to vehicle, inveigh comes from Latin in- + vehere to carry. During the Vietnam War, war
protesters held rallies where young men burned their draft cards and inveighed against the
imperialist motives by which our country was being driven and the war's escalation without its ever
being properly authorized in Congress.
