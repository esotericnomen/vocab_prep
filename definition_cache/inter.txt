Inter means to bury, usually in a tomb or grave. If you loved your cat a lot, you might want to
inter her remains in the back yard and make a nice little memorial.

Most of the time, the word inter is going to be about burying someone or something. Often times, a
family owns a plot of land in a cemetery where all family members are interred when they die.
Occasionally, you might see it in the phrase inter alia, a literary Latin expression meaning among
other things. Your professor is probably a poet and a scholar, inter alia.
