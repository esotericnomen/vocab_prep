Fractions are smaller parts of whole numbers: one-quarter, one-tenth, one-half, and a faction is a
smaller portion of a larger group that breaks away from it. A faction might take a fraction of the
people from a large group and start a new group.

The Latin source of the word faction means to do or make, though a faction can seem to be a taking
away or un-doing. Politics is one area where faction gets a lot of use, because a political party
often starts with a large group but has some members who disagree with a belief or direction. These
members separate from the larger party and become a faction of their own, with many of the same
beliefs as the original group but with a few new differences, too.
