A hoe is a gardening tool made up of a long handle with a sharp metal blade at the end, used to stab
the ground and loosen it.

Hoe can be a noun or a verb, so you can use your hoe to remove weeds from a lawn, or you can hoe
your garden and make it ready to plant.  The word shares the same root as hew, which is a verb that
means to strike, chop, or cut.  The “oe” seems tricky, but remember that it never changes, and
even if you’re hoeing with three hoes in grass you hoed yesterday, the hoe stays the same.
