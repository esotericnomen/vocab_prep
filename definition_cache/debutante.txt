A debutante is usually a wealthy girl whose parents wish to introduce to society in a BIG way — in
a debutante ball that looks like something out of a scene from Gone with the Wind.

In the United States, debutante balls usually, but not always, take place in the South and are a way
to introduce wealthy young women to especially eligible young bachelors. The word debutante is
derived from the French word debut, meaning “a first performance or showing.” The original
French word debutante referred to a new actress making her first appearance on the stage. So, think
of a debutante as a young woman making her debut in society.
