Someone who is dogmatic has arrogant attitudes based on unproved theories. If you dogmatically
assert that the moon is made of green cheese, you'll just get laughed at.

The most basic definition of the adjective dogmatic is that it is related to dogma â&euro;&rdquo;
doctrines relating to morals and faith â&euro;&rdquo; but what it has come to mean is attitudes
that are not only based on unproved theories but are also arrogant in nature. The root of dogmatic
is the Greek word dogmatikos. A synonym of dogmatic is dictatorial and because there are religious
associations to the root word dogma, someone who is dogmatic tends to pontificate.
