Demented is an adjective describing behavior that is crazy, unhinged, or insane. Someone is demented
when they have gone off the deep end.

Demented literally means suffering from dementia, although in current culture it is used quite often
to tease a sibling or good friend: My brother thinks I am demented because I like to eat peanut
butter and salami sandwiches.
