If you are guilty of turpitude, you should be ashamed of yourself. Turpitude is a word that
represents depraved behavior. Prisons are filled with criminals who have engaged in acts of moral
turpitude.

Turpitude comes from the Latin word turpitudo, which means repulsiveness.  Corrupt politicians get
booted out of office for acts of turpitude, like taking bribes in exchange for lucrative government
contracts. Turpitude often follows the word moral, and acts of moral turpitude are usually crimes
that are unusually sick or corrupt.
