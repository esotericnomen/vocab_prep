The predicate is the part of a sentence that includes the verb and verb phrase. The predicate of The
boys went to the zoo is went to the zoo.

We change the pronunciation of this noun (PRED-uh-kit) when we turn it into a verb (PRED-uh-kate).
The verb predicate means to require something as a condition of something else, and we use this term
mostly in connection with logic, mathematics, or rhetoric. To predicate your argument on certain
facts is to use those facts as evidence.
