Neo- means new, and -phyte is from the Greek phuton plantâ&euro;&ldquo;â&euro;&ldquo;like a baby
plant, a neophyte is someone who is new to an activity. A political neophyte is someone who has just
been elected and comes to Washington D.C. not understanding how the game of politics is played. A
Frisbee neophyte is someone who has just thrown the disc for the first time.
