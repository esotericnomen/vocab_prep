A nebula is a massive cloud of gas and dust in outer space. A nebula is sometimes the birthplace of
stars, such as the Orion Nebula where new stars — a youthful million years old –- are still
forming.

Another example of a nebula is the Crab Nebula — the glowing result of a supernova, noted by
Chinese astronomers in 1054 CE. It spans about 10 light-years in length. In biology, a nebula may be
a cloudy formation in the eye, or a cloudiness of urine. It also refers to a medicinal preparation
put in a nebulizer. When you are talking about more than one nebula (which is probably not that
often for the average person), say nebulae.
