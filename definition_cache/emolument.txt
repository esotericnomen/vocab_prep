Not many workers think of their paychecks as emolument, but they certainly could. Emolument is
another way to describe the money you receive for working.

Pronounce emolument with a long e sound in the first syllable and the accent on the second: e MALL
you ment. Emolument traces back to the Latin word emolumentum, meaning profit, gain, which is
believed to have referred to payments made to millers for grinding corn Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; emolere
means grind out. Today, perhaps coincidentally, people refer to work as the grind.
