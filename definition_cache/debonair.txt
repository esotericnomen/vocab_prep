Someone debonair is charming or suave. They have good manners, and they probably look good too.

This French word has a fancy feel to it, and it is a fancy kind of word. Being debonair is a
specific form of being charming that applies mostly to men. When you're debonair, you impress women,
other men, and pretty much everyone with your manners, wit, and style. Debonair a little bit of an
old-fashioned word. Old movie stars like Cary Grant were often called debonair, but not many people
are today.
