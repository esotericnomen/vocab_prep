Sovereignty can describe the power of one state or thing over another or the freedom a state or
thing has to control itself.

Look closely at the word sovereignty, and you will see it is all about who reigns, or rules.
Although sovereignty is usually used in a political sense Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; particularly the power of
nations, it can be used to describe personal control as well: If your mother insists upon your
wearing wool hats in summertime, you might declare complete sovereignty over your wardrobe. The word
is also occasionally used for the power of royalty, like a queen.
