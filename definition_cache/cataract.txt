If someone has a cataract in their right eye, their lens is cloudy rather than clear, so they have
difficulty seeing. Luckily, cataracts are easily removed.

Cataracts, cloudy areas of the lenses of the eye, are often associated with old age. Cataract can
also mean a large waterfall, like Niagara Falls. Even with cataracts, you can still make out a
cataract. It's not a little waterfall; it's huge!
