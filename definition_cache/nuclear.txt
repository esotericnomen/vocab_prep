Nuclear describes something that has to do with the nucleus — the central part — of an atom. If
you're a nuclear physicist, you do a lot of work with that part of the atom.

Nuclear power, which comes from nuclear fission — the energy released when the nucleus of an atom
is split — is a controversial source of renewable energy. The word nuclear is sometimes used
broadly to refer to the core of something. Your nuclear family is you, your parents, and your
siblings — in a sense, the central part of your world, kind of like the nucleus of an atom.
