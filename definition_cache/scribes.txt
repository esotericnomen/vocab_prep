A scribe is a term for someone employed to make written copies of documents. Before printing was
invented, the busy scribes in a village would write copies of all the legal documents.

As a noun, scribe has several meanings. It's used as an informal term to refer to journalists.
Scribe also refers to a sharply pointed tool used for marking wood or metal to be cut. As a verb, it
means to score a line on something with a pointed instrument. The master craftsmen instructed you to
scribe a line on the piece of wood where he pointed, to mark the spot where he wanted it cut.
