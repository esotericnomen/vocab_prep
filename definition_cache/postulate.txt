Assume something or present it as a fact and you postulate it. Physicists postulate the existence of
parallel universes, which is a little mind-blowing.

Anyone who has suffered through geometry class is familiar with some of the greatest hits, like
Euclid's postulate and the point-line-plane postulate. Those are propositions that have to be
assumed for other mathematical statements to follow logically. As a verb (pronounced POST-you-late)
it describes the act of presenting an idea, theory, belief, or concept.
