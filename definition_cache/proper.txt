Something proper is correct or right. There's a proper fork to use for salad, and a proper way to
dress for a wedding.

Things that are proper fit the situation Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; they're the right thing to do, because of
custom or manners. A swear word is the opposite of proper language. Wearing a hat indoors isn't
proper, as your grandparents have probably reminded you. Getting proper medical care means you've
received the appropriate medical care. When things are proper, they're correct and suitable: they
fit.
