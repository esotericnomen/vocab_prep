A mink is a small, furry animal that's similar to a stoat or a weasel. Minks are prized for their
soft pelts, which are often made into fur coats. If you are on your way to an animal rights event,
leave your mink coat in the closet.

You can use the noun mink to talk about the wild animal itself, which is not only hunted for its fur
but also raised on farms, or to describe the wildly expensive coat made from the skin of many minks.
A mink is the sort of warm fur coat you'd most likely see on a wealthy city dweller. The origin of
mink is Scandinavian, related to the Swedish word menk, literally a stinking animal in Finland.
