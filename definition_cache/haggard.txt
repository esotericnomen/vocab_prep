Someone who is haggard looks exhausted and worn out, exactly how you'd expect someone who's been
lost at sea for days to look.

A haggard appearance is usually the result of a long, harrowing ordeal, like getting lost in the
woods or being stranded in the woods for days. An emotional ordeal, like losing a loved one, can
also give someone a haggard appearance if they forget to eat, sleep, and take care of themselves.
Whatever the ordeal, it will make the person look absolutely awful Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; pale, gaunt,
disheveled, exhausted with dark circles under their eyes and wild, unruly hair.
