A swarm is a good word for a large group of bees going on the attack — not good news. Like bees,
any group of people or animals can be considered a swarm if they act together and quickly — even
fiercely.

On a hot day, when an ice-cream truck shows up, it's usually greeted by a swarm of hot, hungry kids.
People at a concert can be a swarm — and people in the swarm can be hurt, because there's lots of
pushing and shoving. When tickets for a popular movie go on sale, a swarm of people will swarm the
theater. As you can see, swarm works as either a noun or verb, and people could teach bees a thing
or two about swarming.
