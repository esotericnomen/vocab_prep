When things mingle, that means they mix together while still retaining their individual qualities.
At a club you may hear laughter that seems to mingle with the sound of the band playing in the
background.

Mingle often describes abstract things, like smells or tastes or feelings. The look on your face may
mingle compassion and horror when you taste your brotherâ&euro;&trade;s attempt at making Key Lime
Pie. Mingle can also describe what you do at a social gathering when you move around a lot and talk
to many different people. If youâ&euro;&trade;re an outgoing person, at a party you probably like
to mingle and talk to friends and also chat with new people.
