White bunny. Moon. Square. Do you understand what that means? Of course not! It's totally cryptic.
Cryptic comments or messages are hard to understand because they seem to have a hidden meaning.

Cryptic is from Late Latin crypticus, from Greek kryptikos, from kryptos hidden. This Greek
adjective is the source of our English word crypt, referring to a room under a church in which dead
people are buried. That might account for why the word cryptic has an eerie tone to it.
