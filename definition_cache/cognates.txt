When you're learning a new language, a cognate is an easy word to remember because it looks and
means the same thing as a word you already know. For example, gratitude in English means the same as
gratitud in Spanish.

Just as words that are cognates have a shared origin -- like gratitude and gratitud both coming from
the Latin word gratitudo, meaning thankfulness -- people can be cognates based on their shared
blood. For example, you and your sister are cognates of your parents. You probably even look alike,
just like word cognates. The adjective form of cognate can describe blood relations or anyone whose
ancestors spoke the same language.
