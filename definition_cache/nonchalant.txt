If your friend is acting cool, unconcerned or in an indifferent manner, call him nonchalant — like
when he saunters by a group of whispering, giggling girls and just nods and says, Hey.

If you act nonchalant, you are literally acting cool, as nonchalant traces back to non- not and
Latin calēre to be warm. Isn't that cool? Sometimes, a nonchalant person acts indifferent or
uninterested, but really cares very much. If you give a girl a nonchalant smile, you definitely want
her to notice you! Even though it begins with non, nonchalant has no positive form —  chalant is
not a word.
