To flout is to scorn or show contempt for. I flout the law and the concept of civilian safety by
making a concerted effort to jaywalk every time I cross a street.

Oddly enough, when flout came into existence in the 1550s, it had a much different sense to it than
it does now; it's believed that it evolved from the Middle English flowten “to play the flute. As
a verb, it means to scorn, as in, for example, to scorn a law, person, or social norm by defying it.
As a noun, it is a contemptuous remark or insult. Wrote William Shakespeare, “Flout 'em, and scout
'em; and scout 'em and flout 'em; Thought is free.”
