If you're irascible, you get angry easily — perhaps blowing up in rage when someone brushes into
you.

Irascible comes from the Latin root ira, which means anger or rage, the same root that gives us  the
word ire, anger. The -sc in the middle of irascible, means becoming, so irascible doesn't just mean
you're angry — it's got action built into it. If you're looking for a fight most of the time, then
you're irascible — ready for the spark that's going to set you on fire.
