Momentum is generally used to mean increasing forward motion. A boulder rolling down a hill gains
momentum. So does a great idea, a team on a winning streak, or the economy.

To find an object's physical momentum you multiply its mass by its velocity. Determining the
momentum of the economy or the latest fad is much more difficult. Used figuratively, momentum
implies that, like a boulder rolling down a hill, something with momentum will continue moving
forward on its own. If you're running for class president, you might want to build momentum by
holding a few rallies, passing out flyers and starting a website. Once you have momentum, your
opponents won't be able to stop you.
