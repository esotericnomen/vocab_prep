It makes sense that a manager is someone who manages, or takes charge of something. A baseball team
manager is in charge of running the team, while a business manager oversees finances, scheduling,
and the everyday operation of the business.

The probable origin of the word manager comes from the Latin manus, meaning hand. A good manager
provides the necessary hand, guiding others. The Italian maneggiare means to control, and was
especially used with reference to training horses, a job for which certain managers you've worked
for might be better suited.  The word extends beyond human beings as well: the file manager on your
computer is a program designed to organize data.
