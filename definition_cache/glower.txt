If you see someone glower at you, you might consider glowering back, but no one likes an angry
staring contest. To glower is not only to stare, it's to stare angrily, as if you're going to
throttle someone.

You might already have guessed that glower isn't of Greek or Latin origin, since it doesn't ring any
of those bells. Chances are that glower comes from northern Europe, where it's related to some old
words that mean to glow. It was probably in the 18th century that it took on the meaning stare at
angrily or sullenly. You can use its root, glo, to recall its meaning: a person that glowers seems
to glow with anger.
