The meaning of mulct is as nasty as it sounds; it means to fine someone or the money you collect as
a result of a fine. No one wants to pay an extra mulct to the city, when it's the city who
mismanaged the budget.

Got mulct? Then somebody took your money. They milked you by mulcting you. And the money that they
took? That's called mulct, too. Some people believe that there's no difference between being mulcted
by the state and being shaken down by the mob. In fact, the word mulct is often used to mean having
your money taken unfairly or as a kind of punishment or as extortion.
