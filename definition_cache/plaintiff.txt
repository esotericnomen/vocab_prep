In a courtroom, the plaintiff is the person or group who is accusing another person or group of some
wrongdoing. If you’re the plaintiff, you are claiming that a law was broken, and you’re in court
to present your case.

The plaintiff accuses, the defendant tries to prove that accusation wrong.  You’ve seen this
relationship on television shows about lawyers, or maybe you’ve been to court yourself.  The Old
French root word translates as “complain” and the Latin root is literally “beating of the
breast,” or explaining your grief in a dramatic way.  Plaintiff shares roots with the adjective
plaintive, which describes a sorrowful sound.  The plaintiff made a plaintive cry when the defendant
was declared not guilty.
