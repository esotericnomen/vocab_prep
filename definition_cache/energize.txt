Energize means to raise the energy level of something. If your really boring teacher suddenly starts
throwing M&Ms; to every student with a correct answer, he will energize the classroom.

Ever seen the Energizer Bunnyâ&euro;&ldquo;â&euro;&ldquo;the one who keeps going and going and
going? It's because he's energized by long-lasting batteries that he has the energy to beat that
drum over and over. Someone who's feeling low on energy might be reenergized by a cat nap or a candy
bar.
