Tactic is another word for maneuver or method. Looking for a way to get something done? Then you
better find a tactic.

English-speakers have been talking about tactics since at least 1640, when this word was first
recorded. A tactic is just a way to do something, a plan, or an approach. Generals have to have a
good grasp on military tactics to win a battle; football teams have to use strong defensive tactics
to keep the other guys from scoring. One time-tested tactic for winning over a teacher? Always turn
your homework in on time!
