When a government is overthrown, the coalition or group that forms and takes control is called a
junta. If the military has seized control, as so often happens, then the group is called a military
junta.

Junta is pronounced with an initial h sound, which gives you a clue to its origins.
It√¢&euro;&trade;s from the Spanish junta, for a military or political group ruling the country
after it has been taken over. Spanish got junta from the Latin jungere, to join. Remember, all the
players in the junta must join together to overthrow the government.
