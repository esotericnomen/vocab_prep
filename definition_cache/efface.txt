If something is erased or rubbed out, it has been effaced. Teachers get annoyed to find that someone
has effaced the blackboard — even the part clearly marked, Do Not Erase!

You can also efface things that are not physical — like effacing feelings, impressions, or
memories. When you efface a memory, you wipe it out as well. Some people believe that their good
deeds are able to efface their past wrongs. They'll have to rely on others' opinions to see how well
that works.
