During a political campaign, you will often hear on TV commercials some canard about the opponent.
This is a false, deluding statement designed to confuse the voters, as it presents the other
candidate in a bad light by spreading an untruth.

The Old French word quanart, duck, morphed into canard, as in vendre un canard Ă  moitiĂŠ, which
refers to half-selling a duck, or cheating someone, and the word came to mean something meant to
fool someone deliberately. Poet James Whitcomb Riley said, When I see a bird that walks like a duck
and swims like a duck and quacks like a duck, I call that bird a duck. Not always the case with
canard.
