You might feel a bit testy before taking a test, but test and testy are unrelated. Feeling testy is
like being peeved, annoyed, or irritated.

The adjective testy is associated with being irritable and on edge. If you find yourself frustrated
and becoming impatient, you might make a testy remark like “What the heck is taking so long?” If
a family member is acting particularly cranky over breakfast, you might say, “Well, aren’t you
testy this morning!” However, a comment like that could be met with a testy reply such as “Mind
your own business!”
