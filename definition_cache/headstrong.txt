Headstrong describes something that's disobedient or willful. If you're headstrong, you want to do
what you want to do. When you refuse to complete your homework because you want to watch a football
game, you're being headstrong.

A closer look at the word headstrong can give you a hint to its meaning — the combination of the
words head and strong. You're determined to have your own way because you have a strong belief that
your view — what you have in your head — is the best one. Being a headstrong person is not
always a bad thing. Sometimes headstrong people make history because they fight traditional values
or outdated rules that need to be changed.
