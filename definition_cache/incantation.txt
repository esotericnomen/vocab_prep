Double, double toil and trouble / Fire burn, and cauldron bubble. These lines, cackled by the Weird
Sisters in Shakespeare's Macbeth, are part of the most famous incantation –- or magic spell made
of words -– in English literature.

Incantation shares a Latin source with enchant, both of which are related to chant. An incantation,
then, summons a thing or action into being with words that are sung, spoken, or written. Long before
it became the catchword of stage magicians, abracadabra was regarded as a powerful incantation
capable of warding off serious disease. The phrase hocus pocus may be a corruption of a seventeenth-
century incantation spoken during the Roman Catholic liturgy of the Eucharist, hoc est corpus.
