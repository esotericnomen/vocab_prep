More than chipper, more than happy, more than delighted is ebullient — meaning bubbling over with
joy and delight.

There are two senses of the word of ebullient. One describes an immediate, and ultimately short-
lived, reaction to a particular event — for example if you've just won the lottery, you are
ebullient. The other describes someone who is perpetually upbeat and cheerful, for example, as in an
ebullient personality. Watch out for ebullient personalities: they can often be over the top as
well.
