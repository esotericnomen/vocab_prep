A ballad is a song that tells a story, and it can be dramatic, funny, or romantic. You can find
ballads in a variety of musical styles, from country-western to rock n' roll.

The ballad is an old musical form. Ballads are often by anonymous composers, passed down from
generation to generation. You may know Ã¢&euro;&oelig;The Ballad of Jesse James, about the notorious
bank robber, which dates from the 1880s and has been recorded by everybody from Woody Guthrie to
Springsteen. A ballad can also be a slow, romantic song, the kind of thing crooners like Johnny
Mathis and Bing Crosby made famous. The word ballad comes from medieval French balade, a dancing
song.
