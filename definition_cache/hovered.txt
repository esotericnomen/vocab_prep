A hover craft flies low over the ground or water — it hovers. Hover can also mean waver. Think of
someone that can’t decide exactly where to land.

To help remember the meaning of hover, think of it as containing the preposition over: things that
hover hang over. A temperature can hover around forty degrees, a grade in a class can hover around a
B.
