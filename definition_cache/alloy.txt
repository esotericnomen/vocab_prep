You may have heard of aluminum alloy on a car. What that means is that there is another metal mixed
in with the aluminum, to save money and/or to strengthen the wheels. The wheels are an alloy (a
mix), rather than pure.

In addition to indicating a dilution of one metal with another, alloy can refer to the dilution of a
feeling or a quality. Knowing that you look awesome in your Halloween costume would be an alloy to
the embarrassment of showing up to a party where you are the only one in a costume.
