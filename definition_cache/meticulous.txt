People who are meticulous can be pretty annoying, what with their extreme attention to detail. But
if that person is, say, your surgeon or your accountant, you'll want them to be meticulous.

The Latin root of meticulous is metus, which means fear, so it's easy to see how eventually
meticulous got its meaning. Someone who's meticulous is afraid of what will happen if they're not
careful enough to get every detail right. Detail oriented and perfectionist are other ways of
describing someone who cares deeply about the small things and about getting things exactly right,
every time. Concert pianists must be meticulous, because audiences are always listening for wrong
notes.
