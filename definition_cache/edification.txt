If something is for your edification, watch out! It means it's designed to improve you in some way,
whether morally, educationally, or spiritually.

Originally edification had a strictly religious sense, in the meaning of building up of the soul,
from the Latin term aedificationem, for construction or building. From the same word we get edifice,
meaning a building, especially a large and imposing one. So, you see, edification is all about
efforts to build you into a more sound human being. Children can have a particular dislike for TV
shows or books that are considered edifying by their parents or teachers.
