Brindled refers to a pattern of brown or gray markings or streaks on an animal. Picture the brindled
hounds running around the race track, or the brindled pit bulls around the hood.

A brindled French bulldog named I'm on Fire was a group winner at the 2010 Westminster Dog Show.
Other breeds of dogs that may have brindled coats include pit bulls, boxers and bull mastiffs, but
you can use this word to describe cats, pigs and horses as well. Brindled is a Middle English word
related to the word burn and has come to mean the streaky brown and gray color of something burned.
