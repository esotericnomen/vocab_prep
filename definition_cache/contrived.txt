If you see something that seems fake since it was too perfectly planned out, call it contrived. If
you can easily predict the final minutes of a made-for-TV movie, then call it contrived.

The adjective contrived describes something that is artificially planned, especially in an obvious
way, so it comes across as faked or forced. It's not just drama that can come off as contrived.
Someone's speech habits, wardrobe, or even personality can seem contrived. Whenever someone appears
as if he or she is trying too hard, they might seem contrived, or the opposite of natural.
