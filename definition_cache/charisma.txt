Frank Sinatra and Elvis Presley had great charisma, or a special personal charm or appeal that gives
them influence or authority.

Charisma is often a quality possessed by successful politicians or other leaders, or by other public
figures. The corresponding adjective is charismatic, and it applies more to personality than
appearance: a handsome and charismatic actor. Charisma was borrowed from a Greek word meaning favor,
gift, from charizesthai to favor, from charis grace.
