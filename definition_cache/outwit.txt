Use the verb outwit to describe using your brain to beat an opponent, like outwitting someone by
figuring out the answer to a difficult riddle.

Wit comes from the Old English word witan, which means to know. So someone who outwits another
person knows more Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; or at least knows more than the person thought. You can outwit
someone with clever words, or with craftiness on the playing field. An unexpected strategy can help
one side outwit the other on the battlefield.
