Use the word horde to describe a large crowd: “A horde of people followed Newman as he left the
airport in Helsinki.”

The noun horde is not for the sedate — the word typically is used to describe a group that is in
motion, maybe even a little unruly, such as a horde of fans pursuing a film star or a horde of ants
invading a picnic. If you are describing a calm, orderly gathering, the word group or crowd may be a
better choice. You can save horde for the next time you need to describe, for example, your
experience at a pre-Christmas sale (“A horde of holiday shoppers rushed toward the last discounted
television set”).
