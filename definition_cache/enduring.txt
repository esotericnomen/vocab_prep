Many people have an enduring love for ice cream, that is, they have loved it for a long time and
will continue to love it into the future. Enduring means long-lasting.

Enduring has roots that go back about 1,500 years to the Late Latin period. It is quite an enduring
word! The original root meant hard, so your enduring friendship or your enduring interest in sports
is solid enough to stand the test of time. Besides meaning long-lasting, enduring sometimes means
long-suffering as when someone has an enduring disposition, but this meaning is found in the verb
more than in the adjective.
