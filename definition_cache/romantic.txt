If something is romantic, it isn't very practical, like the librarian's romantic dream of convincing
every person in town to read a book a week for life â€” a great idea that probably isn't possible.

To be romantic about something can mean that you overlook its flaws and shortcomings. If your
romantic ideal is growing all of your own food on a secluded farm, you are probably ignoring the
tremendous amount of hard work it will require. Or, if you are romantic about love, you believe the
perfect person is out there and in finding one another, all the problems and difficulties of life
will melt away.
