Usury means lending money at exorbitant interest rates. Credit-card companies charging annual
interest rates of 29% are guilty of usury, as far as I'm concerned.

A good way to remember the meaning of usury is that you can hear the word use in there. Think of
charging too much interest as a way of using someone. The sad thing about high interest is that it's
always the people who can least afford it who are charged rates so high that it amounts to usury. In
the old days, if someone was found guilty of usury, they'd be flogged in the town square. Too bad
the credit-card companies can't be dragged out of their holes, because they'd surely get a similar
beating.
