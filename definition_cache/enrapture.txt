To enrapture someone is cast an irresistible spell over them, to make them feel rapture. I was
enraptured by her gorgeous voice and stunning way of interpreting a song.

When you see the word rapture, you know you're dealing with a pleasure so great it borders on the
divine. The Rapture is, after all, what believers call the time when Jesus is meant to return and
take them all to Heaven. So when someone enraptures another person, they're creating a feeling of
wonder, enchantment, and delight that recalls that heavenly feeling. On our first date, I was so
enraptured by his charm, humor, and good looks, I knew we would spend our lives together.
