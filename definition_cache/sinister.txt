People who are left-handed might feel unlucky having to use a desk designed for right-handers, but
there probably wasn't any sinister, or evil, intent behind the design. Or was there?

In the 15th century, when the word sinister came into use in English, people who were left-handed
were thought to be bad luck or even evil. In his play Hamlet, Shakespeare wrote of the villain
holding a human skull in his sinister â&euro;&rdquo; i.e., left â&euro;&rdquo; hand. It would seem
to be sinister, or wicked, enough to see a human skull in the right hand, not to mention unlucky for
the person missing a head in the first place.
