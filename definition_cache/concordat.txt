A concordat is an agreement between parties, especially between nations or between a church and a
nation. A concordat is official, written, and signed.

When there is concord, there is agreement. That can help you remember that a concordat is a type of
agreement between two or more parties. The earliest concordats were between the Roman Catholic
Church and various governments, but a concordat can exist between any two entities, including two
nations. When there's a concordat, the parties sign a contract and agree to do something. A treaty
is a type of concordat.
