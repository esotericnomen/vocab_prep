A fête is a party, often one thrown in someone's honor. You'll find fête used as both a verb and a
noun. If you want to fête someone, throw them a fête.

Fête is a word taken directly from French. In fact, sometimes in English you'll see a circumflex
accent over the first e in fête. This makes it especially easy to remember, because this accent
looks almost like a party hat.
