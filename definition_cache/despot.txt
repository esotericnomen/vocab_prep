A despot, is a cruel, all-controlling ruler. For example, a despot does not allow people to speak
out against the leadership, nor really want them to have much freedom at all.

The word despot came into English in the sixteenth century from Old French, but it traces all the
way back to the Greek word despotes, meaning master of a household, lord, absolute ruler. The word
is often used to describe someone who abuses power and oppresses others. Obviously, it's not a nice
thing to call someone, especially within earshot of the despot who has absolute power over you.
