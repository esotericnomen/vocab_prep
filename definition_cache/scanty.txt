We refer to an amount or thing that is not quite enough as scanty, or lacking. It's an adjective
used to describe something that doesn't offer enough, as in farmers having a scanty crop in a
drought year.

The adjective scanty comes from the Old Norse scamt, which means short or brief, and so suggests a
small amount. The word usually suggests a meager amount, and can refer to anything that is barely
sufficient. Someone trying to stretch a meal might offer scanty servings. On a humorous note, a
Roaring Twenties flapper referred to her underwear as scanties.
