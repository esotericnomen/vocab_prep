The noun reaper refers to a person who harvests crops. If your part-time job involves harvesting
corn by hand, then you're a reaper. Reaper can also refer to a piece of farm equipment used to
harvest crops, especially grains.

It's not a coincidence that reap looks a lot like the word ripe. When the crops are ripe
â&euro;&rdquo; in Old English, ready for reaping, fit for eating â&euro;&rdquo; a reaper, either
human or mechanical, can harvest them. Reap means to cut grain with a hook or sickle. This might
remind you of the Grim Reaper, the personification of death in art, movies, and stories, who is
shown carrying a sickle and is said to be the harvester of souls.
