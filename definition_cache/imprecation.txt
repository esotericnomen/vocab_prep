If you really don't like someone you can shout out an imprecation at them. More than simply the use
of bad language (although that can be involved, too), an imprecation is a damning curse wishing them
nothing but ill.

Originally from a Latin word meaning to invoke evil or bring down bad spirits upon. Not to be
confused with implication, a similar-sounding word with the completely unrelated meaning of implying
something indirectly. These are two very commonly confused words, so be careful. You don't want an
imprecation blasted down upon you from someone who really cares about language.
