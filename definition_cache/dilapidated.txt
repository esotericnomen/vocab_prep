Falling down and in total disrepair, something that's dilapidated is going to need a lot of fixing
up.

Sure, there might be crooked floorboards, mice scurrying underfoot, and pieces missing from the
ceiling, but that dilapidated house does come with one perk: a cheaper price tag! Dilapidated is a
word that implies deterioration, often because of neglect. So if you donâ&euro;&trade;t take care
of things, they can become dilapidated. That goes for houses, tree forts, relationships, health
â&euro;&rdquo;  you name it!
