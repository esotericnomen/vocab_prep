A subaltern is someone with a low ranking in a social, political, or other hierarchy. It can also
mean someone who has been marginalized or oppressed.

From the Latin roots sub- (below), and alternus (all others), subaltern is used to describe someone
of a low rank (as in the military) or class (as in a caste system). Subalterns occupy entry-level
jobs or occupy a lower rung of the corporate ladder. But the term is also used to describe someone
who has no political or economic power, such as a poor person living under a dictatorship.
