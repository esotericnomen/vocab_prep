You're most likely to encounter the adjective eccentric in a description of an unusual or quirky
person â€” like a scatter-brained aunt who leaves her life savings to her cat.

From the Greek ekkentros, out of the center, this word originally had to do with the orbits of
planets that were observed to be slightly out of whack. Eventually it came to describe people who
were a little kooky, both as an adjective and as a noun, too: an eccentric is an unconventional, odd
person. Think of them as following a slightly different orbit from the rest of society.
