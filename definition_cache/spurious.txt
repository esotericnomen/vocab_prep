Something false or inauthentic is spurious. Don't trust spurious ideas and stories. Spurious
statements often are lies, just as a spurious coin is a counterfeit coin — a fake.

Anytime you see the word spurious, you're dealing with things that can't be trusted or accepted at
face value. A spurious claim is one that's not backed up by the facts. A spurious argument relies on
faulty reasoning — and maybe some lies. Politicians often accuse each other of saying things that
are spurious and meant to deceive the voters. As long as you're honest, clear, and not trying to
trick anyone, nobody can say you're being spurious.
