If you are a vendor, it means you’re a person selling something, whether it’s hot dogs from a
food cart or computer software for a tech company.

The word vendor comes from the Latin word vendere, meaning “to sell.” Vendor is a name for
people who sell things on the street, such as a hot dog vendor, but it can describe those who sell
any kind of goods or services, especially a specialized product. A store at the mall isn't usually
called a vendor, but you could use the word to describe the person or group that supplies the store
with special products or services.
