Teach a man to fish and he eats for a day. Teach a man to excel in the piscatorial arts, and he eats
for a lifetime. Piscatorial means having to do with fishing.

Piscis is Latin for fish, the name of the astrological sign meaning fish (spelled Pisces, the Latin
plural), and also the root of piscatorial. Think of the word as a cousin to agricultural. If we
lived in a place that relied as heavily on fisheries as we do on farms, piscatorial might be as
common a word as agricultural.
