As noun and verb, splice refers to the overlapping or interweaving of two ends of something to
create the strongest possible attachment.

The earliest records of the word splice are from the early 16th century, when it was borrowed from
the Middle Dutch verb splissen, used by sailors for joining ropes end to end by interweaving their
strands. In 1912, the infant motion-picture industry took over the word splice to refer to the
cutting and joining of film in the editing process. In 1975, scientists found they could alter genes
by cutting and adding chunks of DNA, creating the science of gene splicing.
