You don't hear about knaves much these days: it's an older word for a rascal, a scoundrel, or a
rogue. It isn't a compliment.

If you read Shakespeare for long, you'll definitely see the word knave more than once. In
Shakespeare, an important person like a king or a prince might call a thief a knave. Knaves always
tend to be up to trouble such as stealing and getting drunk. You don't want to trust a knave; knaves
lie, deceive, and betray. Today, we might call a knave a scumbag or lowlife.
