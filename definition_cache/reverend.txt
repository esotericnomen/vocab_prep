Use the noun reverend to talk about a clergy member of a Christian church, as in: Let's ask the
reverend if she'll marry us next week.

A minister, preacher, or priest can each also be called a reverend. The word is often capitalized,
especially when it's used in the form the Reverend so-and-so. In the early 15th century, it meant
worthy of respect, a meaning that's sometimes still used today, and by the late part of that century
it was being used for clergy members too, though it was earliest spelled reverent.
