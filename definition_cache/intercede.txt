When you intercede, you try to help people work out their differences or achieve something, like
when you intercede on your friend's behalf to encourage your boss to hire him, or when feuding
friends ask you to intercede, guiding them to sort out their differences.

The verb intercede comes from the Latin root words inter, meaning between, and cedere, meaning go.
Acting as a go-between is exactly what you do when you intercede. Maybe you are the peacemaker, or
you play matchmaker, or you just bring people to work out their problems. Sometimes people pray that
God will intercede in their lives, meaning bring change that improves a situation.
