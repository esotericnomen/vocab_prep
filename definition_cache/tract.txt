A tract is a connected group of parts in a body that work together to do one job.  So your bladder
and your kidneys are parts of your urinary tract.

In addition to systems inside your body, the word tract can describe small books and large areas of
land that, hopefully, you will only find outside of your body.  If you were to unwind your
intestine, an important part of your digestive tract, it would not stretch across a large tract of
land, only 25-28 feet Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; but that's still pretty long!  You probably don't need to read
a tract on personal fitness to realize this would be an unhealthy experiment.
