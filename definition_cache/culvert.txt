A culvert is a drain — but not of the kinds that drain your bathtub or empties your bank account.
A culvert is any kind of channel or tunnel that directs unwanted water away from roads and other
corridors of travel.

A culvert is typically built underground to prevent inconveniently located streams and rain runoff
from flooding roads, highways, streets, and railroads. Culvert can also be used as a verb: if water
pools in your driveway and then seeps into the foundation of your house, soaking the brand-new
carpet in the basement that you thought you’d just waterproofed, you might wonder why the builders
didn’t culvert that underground stream.
