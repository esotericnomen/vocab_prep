A peer is someone at your own level. If you are a 10th grader, other high school students are your
peers.

Peer comes from the Latin par which means equal. When you are on par with someone, you are their
peer. If kids your age are pressuring you to do something you don't want to do, that's peer
pressure. In the sport of basketball, Michael Jordan was without peer, no one could equal his
talent. When he switched to baseball, he found himself to be among peers again.
