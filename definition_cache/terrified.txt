When you're terrified, you're so scared you can hardly move. Some people keep fuzzy spiders as pets,
and others are truly terrified of them.

Certain situations cause almost anyone to be terrified: nearly falling off a tall building, seeing
someone you love get very sick, or being chased down a dark alley by a lumbering monster. Other
things that make you feel terrified might be your individual fears, such as speaking in public or
riding in elevators. When you're terrified, you're full of terror, or a panicked fear. The root word
is Latin, terrificare, which means to frighten.
