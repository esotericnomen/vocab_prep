Someone crazy about something can be called a fancier. If you join a club to promote the well-being
of pheasants, someone might describe you as a pheasant fancier. That just means you like pheasants a
lot.

The word fancier can refer to someone who fancies (or really likes) something — such as dogs or
wine or chocolate. It can also be used to describe someone who breeds a particular animal, with the
intent of improving the breed. Make sure you don’t confuse this word with the adjective fancy,
which has a comparative form that is also spelled “fancier.” That fancier would be used in the
sense of “more ornamental” or “more extravagant” — as in My prom dress is fancier than
yours.
