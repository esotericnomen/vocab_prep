A fiduciary is a person who holds assets in trust for someone else. That person has a fiduciary duty
to take care of the money.

Fiduciary comes from the Latin word fidere, to trust. That's because a fiduciary is the person you
trust to hold and watch over your assets until it's time for them to go to another designated
person. For example, when a child's parents die, someone is chosen to look after the money left in
the will until the child is old enough to manage it himself. Fiduciary can either be a noun to refer
to the caretaker or an adjective to describe the trust.
