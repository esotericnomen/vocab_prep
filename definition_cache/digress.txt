If we're talking about science fiction, and you suddenly go off on a long tangent about the cost of
grape soda, you digress. When a person digresses, they stray from the topic.

It's easy to understand why you digressed from the main topic. You were incredibly excited, speeding
on caffeine, and, let's face it, you've never been at a loss for words. Don't get me wrong: I love
your wanderings -- how you drift from one topic to the next, letting your mind explore. The problem
was that the meeting was running late and there was no time to let you digress. I had to pull you
back to the main topic. I didn't want our potential new partners to get the idea that these
digressions were typical.
