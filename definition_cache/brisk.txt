Brisk is one of those delightful words that sounds like what it means: quick, lively, bracing, and
refreshing. There's nothing like a brisk walk in the morning to get the blood flowing and the spirit
ready for the day.

Anything brisk is happening quickly but not too fast. Probably taken from the French brusque, which
also means quick, but in a more negative way, brisk can be used to describe not only physical
actions but also more conceptual notions, such as brisk business around the holidays or brisk
interactions at a speed-dating event. The soft-drink called Brisk must be called that for a good
reason. Perhaps it picks you up!
