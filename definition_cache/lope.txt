Some words are fun to say: lope is one of them. It's also fun to think about, as it means to move
with a casual, striding gait. Imagine a horse cantering along with an easy lope. A pleasant image
indeed.

Before 1825, the meaning of lope was in the line of a leap or springy jump. This comes from the Old
Norse word hlaupa, which sounds like its English meaning, to leap. This is similar to the Old Dutch
lopen, to run, and the Old English hlÄ“apan, leap, as well as the Scots loup, all related to the
modern meaning: a long, striding gait with a little bounce to it.
