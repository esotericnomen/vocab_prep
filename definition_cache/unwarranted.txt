When something is unwarranted it's not called-for under the given circumstances. For example,
debating the merits of someone's talent is one thing, but calling them stupid is unwarranted.

I thought the applause was unwarranted. After all, all the guy did was stand there and point for two
hours. And when that lady started screaming? That was unwarranted, too: all I did was give her a
flat. It was an accident! Think of it this way: when the police want to search your home, they have
to get a warrant Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; a document that allows them to enter. To go into your home without
a warrant would be unwarranted. A warrant is a kind of justification; without that justification,
something could be called unwarranted.
