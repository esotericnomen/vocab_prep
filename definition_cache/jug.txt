Many people buy their milk in a jug, a large container with a handle and a small opening at the top.

A jug usually has a fairly small spout or mouth at the top; a gallon milk container is one kind of
jug, usually made of plastic. Other jugs are made of clay or glass. In some countries, beer comes in
a jug, and in others water is collected and carried in a jug. Earthenware jugs can actually be
played as musical instruments, often in a jug band Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; the player blows across the
opening and holds the jug at different angles.
