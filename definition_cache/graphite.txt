Use the noun graphite when you're talking about the mineral that's used to make pencil lead.

Graphite is a form of carbon that is most commonly found in pencils, although because it is a good
conductor of electricity, it's also used in electrodes and batteries. Graphite can in fact be found
in a wide variety of things, from a car's brake pads to industrial lubricants. The word graphite
comes from the German Graphit, which was named by a mineralogist in 1789 from the Greek word
graphein, write.
