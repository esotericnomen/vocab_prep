The adjective wise describes someone who has experience and a deep understanding. Your wise older
sister always gives the best advice.

When you make a decision based on careful thought and good judgment, you've made a wise choice. If
someone calls you a wise guy, though, it's not a compliment: it's likely to be a criticism of your
joke at someone else's expense or your rudeness. To wise off (or sometimes, to be wise), has a
similar meaning: to talk back or be disrespectful.
