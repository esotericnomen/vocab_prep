An apostate is someone who has deserted his cause.

The word apostate originally comes from a Greek word that meant runaway slave. Now, apostate has a
religious or political tone to it, so someone might call you a political apostate if you ran for
office as a Republican during one election and then ran as a Democrat in the following election.
