An egghead is a smart, nerdy person. You might call your studious older brother, who always seems to
have a book in his hand, an egghead.

The word egghead is a very informal, slightly insulting name for an intellectual. College libraries
are full of eggheads, academics who are researching and writing and thinking about their scholarly
pursuits. The word originally meant bald person, but it came to mean smart person in Chicago-area
slang, particularly among newspaper reporters around 1918.
