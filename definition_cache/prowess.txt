Prowess means exceptional skill or ability. Your sailing prowess might save your life in a storm,
while someone with less experience might make mistakes.

An earlier meaning of this word is exceptional bravery in battle, or a specific act of bravery.
Prowess is from Middle English, from Old French proece, proesse, from prou, prud good, capable,
brave. The related English word proud has the now obsolete meaning of brave.
