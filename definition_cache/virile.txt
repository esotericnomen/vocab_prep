You'll often hear the word virile referring to a manly, powerful man, because the word means having
physical strength and other typical masculine qualities.

When you think of a virile man, you imagine a tough, strong guy who's full of energy, vigor, and
sexual potency. He's definitely not a wimp. Men admire him and women want to be with him. Superman
is one guy who could easily be described as virile. The Man of Steel, with his muscles rippling
under the S emblazoned on his costume, has superhuman strength and charm. That's why Lois Lane can't
keep her eyes â&euro;&rdquo; and hands â&euro;&rdquo; off him.
