Varnish is a shiny coating that's painted on a floor or piece of furniture and then dries clear and
luminous. After refinishing an old oak chair, you might apply a coat of varnish. (Just don't sit on
it until it's dry.)

Varnish gives artwork, furniture, and other objects a finished, glossy look, and it also protects
the surface. Most varnish is made from oil, solvent, and resin. You can also use the word as a verb,
meaning to coat with varnish. Many people decide to varnish their wood floors or their wooden
kitchen counters. The Medieval Latin root word is vernix, odorous or fragrant resin.
