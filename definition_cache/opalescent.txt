If you're familiar with the way that the gemstone opal shimmers like a pearl, then you'll understand
that something opalescent reflects the light in the same way.

Opal is a beautiful mineral with an almost magical, layered reflective quality that catches the eye
the way a pearl does. Something opalescent has that same reflective quality. High-quality guitars,
for example, often have opalescent inlays in the fingerboard that are not only beautiful but also
useful. They can help the guitar player find her way around the instrument. Don't be fooled by
imitations! Many fake jewels have an opalescent quality that mimics real pearl, but it's plastic,
all the same.
