A catapult is something that hurls things through the air, like a catapult that send pumpkins flying
in an annual Halloween competition.

To pronounce catapult, accent the first syllable: CAT a pult. Catapult can also be a verb that means
to hurl or shoot forward. It's not only objects that catapult. A hit single can catapult a band to
great fame, for example, or a high score may catapult you into first place. Just don't catapult any
cats. That would catapult you to notoriety, and probably also to jail.
