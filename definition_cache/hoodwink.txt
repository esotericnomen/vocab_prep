To hoodwink someone means to trick or mislead them. Beware of fake ATMs that try to hoodwink you
into giving over your bank card and your code, only to keep them both and steal all your money.

An excellent, old-fashioned word is hoodwink, and you√¢&euro;&trade;ll be happy you know it when you
have to read Victorian novels in which characters are repeatedly hoodwinked. It is an Old English
compound which meant to blindfold 600 years ago but quickly began to be used figuratively. Think
about the expression, to pull the wool over someone's eyes, as having the same image and meaning.
Has your big sister ever hoodwinked you into doing her chores for her?
