Use the adjective connubial to describe something that relates to marriage or to the relationship
between husband and wife, such as connubial bliss or a connubial argument about who will take out
the trash.

Accent the second syllable in connubial: ka-NEW-bee-ul. The Latin prefix con- means together and
nubilis means marriageable, which itself comes from nubere, meaning take as husband. Nubere is also
responsible for the word nubile, which was coined in the 1640s to describe a woman who was
considered marriage material. Today, it refers to a young, attractive woman.
