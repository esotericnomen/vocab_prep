It's everywhere! It's everywhere! When something seems like it's present in all places at the same
time, reach for the adjective ubiquitous.

Cities like Singapore aim to cloak themselves in ubiquitous, free Wi-Fi in the next few years, The
Wall Street Journal reported recently — meaning that those savvy Singaporeans will find a wireless
connection everywhere they go. The word, comes from the Latin ubique, meaning — you guessed it —
everywhere. The usual pronunciation is yoo-BIK-wih-tihs, but Joseph Heller must have had the older
variant ooh-BIK-wih-tihs in mind when he wrote in Catch-22 that a character padded through the
shadows fruitlessly like an ubiquitous spook.
