An interrogation is a question or an intense questioning session. Police do interrogations of
suspects all the time.

Have you ever heard someone say, What is this? An interrogation? People say that when they feel like
they're being questioned a little too much. An interrogation can mean a single question or a series
of questions. Police stations usually have interrogation rooms for questioning suspects. When
someone is doing an interrogation, they're looking for answers, and it's usually about something
very serious.
