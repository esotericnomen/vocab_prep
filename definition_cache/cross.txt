When you cross something, you travel over it â€” like when you cross the street, after looking both
ways and using the crosswalk, of course.

A commercial pilot might cross the continent several times a week, and a boy might cross several
back yards on his way to school. Another kind of cross is a written mark, an upended X on a piece of
paper. There's also the adjective cross, which describes someone who is extremely cranky. The Latin
root word crux means stake or cross, but its figurative meaning, trouble or misery, is related to to
traditional use of wooden crosses to hang criminals.
