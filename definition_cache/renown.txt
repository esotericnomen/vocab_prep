Renown is fame and acclaim â€” the kind of celebrity that most people only dream about. Renown is
not only about celebrity, though, it also means to be highly respected in one's field.

Actors, musicians, and artists practice their art, sometimes for many years, to gain the kind of
renown, or fame, that will launch their faces onto the covers of magazines and make their name known
in every household. Greta Garbo, Luciano Pavarotti, and Salvador Dali all became renowned in their
respective fields. They won numerous awards, and who isn't familiar with their names? Even things or
places can achieve renown if they offer something worth celebrating. An ice cream parlor can become
renowned for its incredible mint chip ice cream, or a bank can be renowned for its excellent
customer service.
