Used as a noun or adjective, epicurean refers to a devotion to pleasure or refined, sensuous
enjoyment, especially of good food and drink.

Epicurus, the ancient Greek philosopher this word was named after, taught his students that pleasure
was a sign of the good, and pain a sign of evil. Thus the good life was one filled with pleasure and
the avoidance of pain. Over the centuries, epicurean has come to refer to the pursuit of the finer
things in life, and the word has a whole host of great synonyms, including luxurious, voluptuous,
hedonistic, and, as a noun, bon vivant.
