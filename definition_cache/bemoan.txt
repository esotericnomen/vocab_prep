Some people love to complain, don't they? Complainers also tend to bemoan things, which can be
translated to Oh no! Why me?

A more casual expression for bemoan is to moan and groan. If you step in a puddle and get your shoes
wet, you might moan and groan about, or bemoan, your bad luck to whoever will listen. Just about any
bad or annoying thing can be bemoaned. In fact, people love to bemoan how much other people are
moaning and groaning about things!
