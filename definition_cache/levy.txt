Use the word levy as you would use the word tax: “When the state government imposed a levy on soft
drinks, thousands of citizens took to the streets in protest.”

The word levy can act as either a verb or a noun in a sentence. The noun levy refers to a charge,
such as a tax, fine, or other fee, that is imposed on something. The verb levy is used to describe
the act of imposing or collecting the charge. If you need to raise money, for example, you may
decide to levy a fine on your family every time you have to make the coffee in the morning. (Be
careful though: your family may also take to the streets in protest.)
