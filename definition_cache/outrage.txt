If you consider how people are treated in airports an outrage, you get really angry over airport
security or the price of airport food. Six dollars for a piece of pizza? What an outrage!

Something is an outrage when it is shocking and makes you angry. Stealing from an orphanage? That's
an outrage. Sometimes outrage leads to action. Public outrage over the latest political  scandal
often makes the news.
