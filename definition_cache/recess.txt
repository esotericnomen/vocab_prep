Recess is a break from doing something, like work or school. Almost everyone looks forward to taking
a recess — even if you don't have access to monkey bars.

Recess comes from the Latin word recessus, meaning a going back, retreat. You may have heard
children talking about recess as their favorite part of school. This meaning of the word refers to
the break in a school day for children to play, usually outside in a playground. As a verb, recess
means to take a break at the end of a session — usually in a court proceeding: The judge announced
the court would recess until the following day.
