When a place is seedy, it's sleazy, run-down â€” not the kind of place you'd take your mom. The East
Village of New York was once known for being seedy, but now it's safe for children of all ages.

It's a mystery how the word seedy came to mean darkly rundown, slummy, and seamy, but it probably
came from the appearance of flowers after they've shed their seeds. That's when they start to lose
their color and eventually die. You'll find seedy used to describe places like dive bars, brothels,
and those sections of town where dealers ply their drugs. Certain writers, such as Dennis Cooper and
even Charles Dickens, are fascinated by the seedy underbelly of life in big cities, in scenes
populated by wretched people and other outcasts.
