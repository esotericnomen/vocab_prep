A surge is a sudden strong swelling, like a tsunami wave that engulfs the land. Although a surge
offers a fluid image, anything can experience a sudden surge, including emotions, political support,
or an angry mob.

The original Latin word surgere, meaning â&euro;&oelig;to spring up or rise,â&euro;? serves as the
basis for the word surge, which refers to a great sudden growth or swelling.  If you are watching a
sad movie and you experience a sudden surge of emotion, do you quietly reach for a tissue, pretend
something's in your eye, or simply weep and sob with reckless abandon.  Yeah, me too.  Christmas
shopping can be dangerous when there is a surge of interest in one toy and desperate shoppers surge
into stores trying to grab it up.
