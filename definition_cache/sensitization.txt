Feeling more sensitive these days? It might be the result of sensitization, the process of making
someone react to something that previously had no effect.

The noun sensitization is formed from the verb sensitize, which in turn comes from the adjective
sensitive, meaning capable of sensation. In psychology talk, a person might develop a sensitization
from an emotional situation. For example, a child who is verbally bullied on a regular basis might,
through constant fear of attack, develop a sensitization toward other children and become more
withdrawn.
