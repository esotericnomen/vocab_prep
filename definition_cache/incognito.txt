When you want to do something and not be recognized, go incognito â€” hiding your true identity.

It is funny that the words, recognize and incognito, are both related to the Latin verb, cognoscere,
to get to know because when you do something incognito, you do not want to be recognized.
Celebrities often try to go out or travel incognito so that they may have some privacy, whereas an
average person might want to remain incognito in order to observe something they might not otherwise
be able to see (like a celebrity).
