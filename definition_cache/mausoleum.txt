Mausoleion, the Greek source of the Latinized mausoleum, was the name given to the tomb of the King
Mausolus, a Persian ruler who died in 353 B.C.E. This vast elaborate structure was one of the Seven
Wonders of the Ancient World. Other notable mausoleums or mausolea include the mausoleum of China's
First Qin Emperor â&euro;&ldquo;- the site of the famous Terra Cotta Army â&euro;&rdquo; and the
tombs of Ulysses S. Grant and Abraham Lincoln.
