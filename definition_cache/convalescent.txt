A person who's recovering from an illness is a convalescent. As a convalescent recovering from
surgery, your grandmother would probably love some company to cheer her and help pass the time.

Convalescent, as an adjective, can describe the period of recovery or anything related to the
process of returning to health, like a convalescent program of physical therapy or a convalescent
ward at a hospital. As a noun, a convalescent is a person who is recovering from being sick. The
origin of convalescent is the Latin root valescere, which means to begin to grow strong.
