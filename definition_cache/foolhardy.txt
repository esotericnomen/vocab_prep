If you decide you are going to scale Mt. Everest next weekend without any training or experience,
that would be a foolhardy decision. Use the adjective foolhardy when someone rushes into action
without considering the consequences.

Foolhardy is a combination of the noun fool and the adjective hardy, meaning brave or bold. Put them
together and you’ve got “foolishly brave.” Someone who is foolhardy throws caution to the wind
and takes reckless chances. A foolhardy mistake is typically the result of this kind of impulsive
behavior. But foolhardy doesn’t always imply foolishness or stupidity; foolhardy can convey
courage and romance, as in the case of a foolhardy passion or desire.
