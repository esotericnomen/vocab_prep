If your new puppy runs all over the house, jumps on the furniture, and enthusiastically chews up
your socks,  you may congratulate yourself on your new pup's vigor, or lively sense of energy.

Aside from mental or physical vitality, the noun vigor can be applied to an imaginative style of
thought or expression and also to a forceful intensity. The jury was not only willing to acquit the
defendant, but also nominate him for sainthood, by the time his attorney had delivered, with vigor,
an impassioned plea for his client's innocence.
