If you blurt something out, you're speaking abruptly and without thinking about what you're saying.

Usually, when you blurt something, you end up regretting it. Saying something without considering
your words can end up making you feel stupid or hurting someone's feelings Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; just
imagine what might happen if you were to blurt out what you really think about your grandmother's
cooking. The best thing about the word blurt is that it's onomatopoeic, or a word that sounds
exactly like what it means.
