If you stipple something, that means you add tiny dots of color or texture, such as using a special
painting tool to stipple a plain wall with dots of a different color to make it look more
interesting.

The verb stipple came into English from the Dutch word stippelen, meaning to spot or dot.” Artist
stipple paint onto their canvases and from the distance, the dots look like a field of flowers. You
can also stipple metal, by poking it with a tool that creates little circular dents — that look
like dots — to give it an artistic look.
