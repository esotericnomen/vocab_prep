While outstrip might make you think about undressing, it really means outdoing. If the productivity
of your garden outstrips your neighbor's, expect the neighborhood to come calling for fresh
vegetables.

If one thing outstrips another, it exceeds it or goes beyond it. When you outstrip someone during a
race, you pass them. When one companyâ&euro;&trade;s profits outstrip anotherâ&euro;&trade;s, they
make more money. When the productivity  of one nation outstrips the neighboring nation, they will
have a bigger Gross National Product.
