Something is prurient if it focuses attention on sex not in an artistic way or to teach something,
but purely to appeal to your baser instincts. If something is prurient, it's sure to offend
somebody.

An MTV series that includes explicit teenage sex scenes might be considered prurient and have
censors screaming to have it taken off the air. The word prurient comes from a Latin root that means
literally, to itch,Ã¢&euro;? and you may have heard the medical term pruritus, which means severe
itching. The word can also be used to describe any kind of perverse interest, like onlookers who
have a prurient curiosity about the details of a particularly gory crime scene.
