The grimace on her face when he asked her to the prom told him her answer was no before she said a
word. A grimace is a facial expression that usually suggests disgust or pain, but sometimes comic
exaggeration.

Picture someone wrinkling his nose, squeezing his eyes shut, and twisting his mouth and you'll have
a pretty solid mental image of a grimace. It can be a verb, as in the class grimaced at the
teacher's suggestion of a pop quiz. Or it words as a noun. The class gave a grimace when the teacher
suggested a pop quiz. Its forerunner was the 17th century Spanish grimazo, meaning caricature, and
grima, meaning fright.
