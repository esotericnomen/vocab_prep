A furor is a strong and sudden reaction, often negative and shared by many people, such as the furor
that erupted when Coca-Cola replaced its beloved soft drink with New Coke in the 1980s.

Like the Latin word furia, which means passion, a furor involves strong emotion. Not all furors are
negative Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; sometimes a furor is just a fad or a craze that seems to come out of
nowhere, like the rubber bracelets every kid in school seemed to start wearing at the exact same
second. That bracelet furor? It all started with kids getting excited and saying they just had to
have them.
