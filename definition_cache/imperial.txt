Imperial carries the implication of royalty, usually pertaining to an empire; the emperor or empress
is referred to as your imperial highness.

The word imperial has a lofty feel, and though it's often used of royalty, it is sometimes used to
refer to anything extremely large or impressive. It was once the name of a large suitcase that was
too big to fit inside a coach and so was tied on top. Think of something imperial as being something
so upper-class that it's almost to the point of royalty â&euro;&rdquo; and sometimes almost to the
point of being a joke.
