When you memorialize something, you honor it or do something so it will be remembered. If you want
to remember a summer trip taken with friends, you could make a photo album full of the pictures you
took to memorialize it.

The word memorialize often is used in relation to someone or something that has passed away or even
to a group of connected individuals who have perished. You might see a monument, for example, that
memorializes victims of an earthquake, meaning pays tribute to them. You can also memorialize
someone in a speech, meaning you tell about the person's life and describe how he or she has
affected others.
