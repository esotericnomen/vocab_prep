If something is supposed to happen but hasn’t happened yet, it is pending, like the pending
snowstorm that has everyone scrambling to the store for bread and milk.

The word pending comes from the French pendant, meaning “hanging.” If someone leaves you
hanging, you are waiting for a call, a message, a visit — whatever the thing is that's supposed to
happen. Pending is a good word to use when something has to happen before something else — like if
you are learning to drive, maybe you'll have a car of your own soon, pending your success at passing
the test.
