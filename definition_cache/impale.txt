The verb impale means to pierce an object with a sharp stick. When you're preparing shish kebabs,
you impale chunks of marinated vegetables and meat on pointy metal skewers and then cook them on a
grill.

Impale comes from the Medieval Latin word impalare, which means to push onto a stake. Impale can
also mean to kill by piercing with a stake or spear. Legend has it that the only way to kill a
vampire is to do exactly that: impale him with a wooden stake through the heart Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; and
then stuff his mouth with garlic and chop off his head, too, just to be sure.
