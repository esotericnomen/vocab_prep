Myopic is an adjective meaning shortsighted in every sense. Whether you need glasses or a new
attitude, if you can't see the forest for the trees, you're myopic.

Myopic began as a description of the condition that made people squint and was easily cured with a
pair of pink cat-eye glasses, but it came to include people or plans with a lack of foresight.
Although it's good to live in the moment, it's not a compliment to be called myopic Ã¢&euro;&rdquo;
a myopic party host might have festive decorations but no food for hungry guests, and myopic
students have no interest in anything beyond what's on the test. In terms of pronunciation: it's a
tomato/tomahto word: pronounce it my-OP-ick or my-OH-pick, although that short o sound is preferred.
