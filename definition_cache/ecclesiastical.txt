Anything ecclesiastical is related to the Christian church. An ecclesiastical office is the office
at a church, and a nunâ€™s habit is  ecclesiastical dress. A hat with a propeller on top is not.

Ecclesiastical things have to do with Christian churches or the clergy. Pews, readings from the
Bible, and stained glass windows are all part of the ecclesiastical world. The ecclesiastical
hierarchy is the pecking order of the clergy. If a politician gets support from a church, that's an
ecclesiastical endorsement. If you believe in the separation of church and state, you definitely
don't want ecclesiastical teachings to inform the way laws are made. Secular is the opposite of
ecclesiastical.
