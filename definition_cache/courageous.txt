If you are a courageous person, you face danger or stand up against the odds without flinching.
Known as The Man without Fear, Daredevil is regarded as a very courageous superhero.

The adjective courageous derives from the Old French word corage, meaning heart, innermost feelings,
or temper. In fairytales, the courageous knight battles the fire breathing dragon to save the
princess. In recognition of their courageous actions, soldiers who have been wounded or killed while
serving are given the Purple Heart medal.
