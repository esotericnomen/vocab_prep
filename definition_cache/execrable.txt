If something's execrable it's really and truly, unbelievably, absolutely the worst.

Execrable is often used as a harshly critical term in the arts, when a reviewer really wants to
throw the book at something. Not surprisingly, the word comes from a Latin word meaning to utter a
curse; to hate or abhor. Tough words for bad art. Perhaps part of the power and nastiness of
execrable lies in the word's similarity to excrement Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; but that's a vocabulary word
we're not touching in this entry!
