folks.

If something is driving you absolutely crazy, it's probably obnoxious. Yelling and stomping your
feet is obnoxious. Poking someone repeatedly is obnoxious. Driving like a maniac is obnoxious. If
the teacher comes in and finds students jumping up and down and throwing books, she might say, Stop
