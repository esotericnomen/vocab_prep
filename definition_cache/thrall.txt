When you're in thrall to someone, you are under their control in some way. If you're being held as a
hostage, you're in thrall to your captor.

You can be in thrall to anything that holds you captive or controls your thoughts or actions, like
an addiction, a disease, or a cult leader. The Old English word that thrall comes from literally
means slave or servant. Another word with the same root as thrall is enthrall, which is sort of a
friendlier version of the same idea. If you're enthralled by someone, you're captivated or
fascinated, rather than held in bondage.
