As any fan of Star Trek knows, “live long and prosper” is good advice. The verb prosper means to
do well, to succeed, or thrive.

The verb prosper commonly means to generate wealth like, “the bank aims to prosper from its new
investments.” But more generally it means “grow stronger” or flourish — such as “after a
slow start, fall crops prosper,” or “we hope the animals will prosper in their new
environment.” You can prosper from good advice or a wise decision, for example, “cheaters never
prosper” is one piece of advice that you can prosper from.
