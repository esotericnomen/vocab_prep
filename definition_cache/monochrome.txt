If you prefer to use monochrome film, it means that you love black and white photography.

Use the adjective monochrome to describe something that's a single color, usually in different
shades or tones. If you've ever watched an old black-and-white movie, you know what monochrome film
looks like. You can also call a black-and-white photograph a monochrome. The Greek root,
monochromos, means of a single color, from monos, single or one, and khroma, color. Originally, it
referred to art drawn or painted in tones of one color.
