A conformist is a person who follows traditional standards of conduct. If you're a conformist, it's
unlikely you'll join a revolution to overthrow your government; instead you'll argue that it's best
to keep things the way they are.

Conformist comes from the Old French word conformer, which means to agree to, make or be similar, be
agreeable. People sometimes use the term conformist in a negative way, as an insult implying that
someone doesn't have the brains or the guts to question the status quo. Conformist can also be used
as an adjective to describe something that follows convention and established customs. A conformist
school board, for example, would follow the usual time-tested curriculum.
