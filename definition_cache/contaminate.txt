The verb contaminate means the same as pollute. Whether it’s food, air, or water, when you
contaminate something, you make it impure or hazardous.

Contaminate comes from the Latin word contaminat-, meaning “made impure.” You can use the word
to indicate that a hazardous substance has been introduced into something else, such as food that is
contaminated with mold. It can also be used figuratively to describe the spoiling of a good thing,
like one person's habit of gossiping that can contaminate a conversation among friends.
