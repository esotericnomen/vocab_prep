A witless person is a numbskull. To be witless is not to lack the funny kind of wit, but to lack the
brains kind of wit. If you're witless, you don't have your wits about you.

I wouldn't call you stupid, exactly. After all, anyone who can calculate pi to the 20th decimal
point without even using a pencil is anything but dumb. But I would call you witless for not knowing
that when a woman asks you Does this dress make me look fat?, the answer should always be No. You
may have heard someone say Keep your wits about you, which means Stay alert! Well, if you're
behaving in a witless fashion, then you're not being alert or showing proper judgment. Even smart
people can be witless from time to time.
