To frisk someone is to search them, usually for weapons. It’s typical for a crime show to portray
a police officer frisking a suspect.

The purpose of frisking is to find out if someone is carrying a particular kind of item. The person
doing the frisking may be looking for weapons or a recording device. Another meaning of frisk is
more light-hearted: “to play in an enthusiastic manner.” Kids running around a playground are
frisking. If you say there’s frisking going on in a nearby park, you might want to clarify which
meaning you’re indicating.
