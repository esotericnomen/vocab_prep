Cessation is an end to something, such as the stopping of a bad habit, like the cessation of
smoking.

Cessation and cease sound alike and have similar meanings because they both come from the Latin word
cessare, which means to delay, to stop.  The cessation can be permanent, such as when the protests
resulted in the cessation of the use of baby bunnies to test lipsticks (forever ending the bunny
torture); or temporary, such as the cessation of the rain during the storm that let us run to the
car without getting wet (but rain, like sunshine, always comes back).
