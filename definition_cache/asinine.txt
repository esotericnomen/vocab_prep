If you want to call someone a complete stupid while sounding smart yourself, asinine is your go-to
word.

Asinine derives from the Latin asinus. Guess what that means? Bonus: Asinine takes stupid up a
notch. There's someone so delightful in the double-edged quality of asinine behavior. Talking trash
about your boss is stupid. Talking trash about your boss in an email they're cc'd on...that's
asinine.
