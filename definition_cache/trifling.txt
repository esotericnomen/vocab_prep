If something is trifling it's really unimportant, of no consequence â€” a trifling detail.

Everything is relative, of course, and what might appear trifling to one person may take on deep
importance for another. Clues are classically trifling things. As Sherlock Holmes explains to Dr.
Watson when faced with a seemingly minor detail: It is, of course, a trifle, but there is nothing so
important as trifles.
