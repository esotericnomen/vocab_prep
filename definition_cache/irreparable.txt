If something is broken or destroyed for good — a toy, a relationship, a pair of pants — you can
say it is irreparable or unable to be repaired.

When you get into a fight with your best friend, it sometimes feels like the damage to the
relationship has been irreparable, but given some time, good friendships can come back from even the
worst type of damage. Though irreparable looks like it might be pronounced ir-re-PAIR-able, it's
usually pronounced ir-REP-ar-able.
