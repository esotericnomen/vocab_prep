You can describe your kitten as your young feline friend, since feline describes anything having to
do with cats.

The adjective feline is useful when you're talking about cats Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; just as canine
describes dogs, and ursine describes bears. You might talk about the special feline food and toys
you buy for your pet, or describe his feline beauty. You can even describe a person as feline, if
something about him or her is catlike. The Latin root felinus means of or belonging to a cat, from
feles, cat.
