Home is where you live: your house, apartment, or condo. It's also the place we feel most
comfortable, loved, and protected — where we most feel at home.

Home is many things to many people. It's the place you live, and the places you love: people might
feel at home in a bookstore, a park, or certain cities. Old people live in nursing homes, and
baseball players try to reach home plate. Animal shelters find homes for pets. Most people feel safe
and happy at home, even if it's not perfect. It’s easy to find somewhere to live, but it’s tough
to make a real home.
