To debar is to officially bar, ban, or exclude someone from doing something. Debar can also mean to
prevent something from happening. If you have a hat club, you can debar anyone whoâ€™s not wearing
one.

If someone is barred from entering, they are prevented from entering. Oddly enough, to debar them
means the same thing. If you're debarred from a school, you can no longer attend. If a politician is
debarred from office, they've been thrown out. You can also debar events. Eating well and exercising
can debar many health problems. This kind of debarring means the same as averting. People try to
debar negative things from happening.
