To blanch is to turn pale, usually as the result of a physical or psychological shock. Nineteenth
century literary heroines were frequently blanching â€” before they fainted, that is.

Blanch has also taken on the more general meaning of to cause shock in general. A government can
blanch at following through a particular reform, without the implication that an entire cabinet
actually turned white. You can blanch an inanimate object, too, when you deprive it of its natural
color. White toilet paper has been blanched by using bleach, for example, though environmentalists
blanch at the thought.
