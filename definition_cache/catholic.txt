When capitalized, Catholic refers to the Catholic Church. With a lower-case c, catholic means
universal and inclusive. If you listen to anything from hip-hop to Baroque, you have catholic taste
in music.

When it entered the English language in the sixteenth century, catholic simply meant general or
common. Applied to the Western Church, it essentially meant the Church universal, or the whole body
of Christian believers, as opposed to separate congregations. After the Reformation, the Western
Church called itself the Catholic Church to distinguish itself from communities of faith that were
no longer obedient to Rome. This usage remains the most common, although you can still use catholic
to mean general.
