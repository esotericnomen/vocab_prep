Providence is the guardianship and care provided by a deity or god. Religious people thank their god
for his providence.

The word provide is a good clue to this word's meaning: when a religious being is said to give
people providence, he's taking care of them — providing for them. For religious people, any good
thing that happens to them — like landing a new job, getting healthy, or finding money on the
ground — could be considered an example of providence. You can also talk about people providing
providence, if they're showing care and prudence in managing resources.
