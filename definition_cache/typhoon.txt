What a hurricane is to the United States, a typhoon is to South Pacific and Asian nations. It's a
giant, rotating storm that brings awesome wind, rain, and destruction.

One thing that makes typhoons like hurricanesâ&euro;&rdquo;aside from intense
weatherâ&euro;&rdquo;is that we give them names. Why? That's a discussion for another day. If
you're having a hard time recalling the meaning of typhoon, try this silliness: The typhoon knocked
out all the power. I cannot use the telephoon. You can also remind yourself that typhoon rhymes with
another form of harsh weather, the monsoon.
