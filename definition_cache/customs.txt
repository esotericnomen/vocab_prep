Customs are taxes, or duties, that you sometimes have to pay when you import goods from another
country.

When you return home from a trip to another country, you have to clear customs by talking to a
customs officer and declaring everything you bought or got as a gift while you were traveling. If
you're bringing in a lot of stuff, you may have to pay customs â&euro;&rdquo; the duty on imports.
Customs are a source of income for a country, and they also provide control over
whatâ&euro;&trade;s coming in.
