Regicide is the killing of a king (or queen.) From the Latin regis, meaning king and the ancient
French cide, meaning killer.  Today it can also be applied to politicians who topple a president or
prime minister.

People had been killing kings and queens (think Cleopatra) long before the term regicide really took
off, which was after the execution of King Charles I in England in 1649. The guy had his head
chopped off, but a far worse fate awaited those who had signed off in Parliament on the head-
chopping. They were hung, drawn, and quartered Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; i.e., cut up and hanged while still
alive. Dangerous profession, regicide.
