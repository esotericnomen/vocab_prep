If you find good things without looking for them, serendipity — unexpected good luck — has
brought them to you.

Serendipity does not come from Latin or Greek, but rather was created by a British nobleman in the
mid 1700s from an ancient Persian fairy tale. The meaning of the word, good luck in finding valuable
things unintentionally, refers to the fairy tale characters who were always making discoveries
through chance. You can thank serendipity if you find a pencil at an empty desk just at you walk
into an exam and realize that you forgot yours.
