If you're hale, you’re strong and in good health. Think hale and hearty, the well-known phrase to
describe someone who can lift a piano or work ten hours in a field without blinking an eye.

Don't confuse hale with hail. Hale, again, is healthy. Hail is for hailing a cab, or hailing to
Caesar, and it also means a kind of precipitation where frozen ice balls pour down from the sky.
Hale is a word that conjures up country folk, farming stock, people who swear that they haven’t
had to go to a doctor in ten years because they sleep with the windows open 365 days a year.
