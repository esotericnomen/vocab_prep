If anyone has ever told you to do something you didn’t want to do, you’ve felt a disinclination,
a doubt about participating. Having a disinclination means you’re just not into it, so you
hesitate.

In Herman Melville’s short novel “Bartleby, the Scrivener,” when anyone asks Bartleby for a
favor, he always replies, “I would prefer not to.” That’s an example of a disinclination —
the feeling that there are other things you’d rather be doing. If someone tells you to eat a
lightbulb, you might feel a disinclination to do that, and for good reason. The Latin roots of the
word roughly translate to “unable to bend,” which describes your unwilling disinclination quite
well.
