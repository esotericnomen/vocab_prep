Seeing a word in context lets you glean information about how it's used. Glean means to gather bit
by bit. You might say, I couldn't understand her accent, but from what I could glean, she needs
money to take the bus.

In the Book of Ruth in The Bible, Ruth meets her future husband when she asked permission to glean
from his fields, which means follow the grain cutters, gathering the seed kernels that have fallen
on the ground. For the very poor at this time, gleaning was often means of getting food.
