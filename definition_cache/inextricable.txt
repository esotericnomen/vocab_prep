A chain that is very badly knotted and cannot be unraveled is inextricable. You cannot disentangle
it.

Inextricable comes from the Latin prefix in- meaning not and extricare meaning unravel. Something
that is inextricable cannot be unraveled. This isn't just limited to objects. Memories from
childhood can sometimes be inextricable from other associations Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; so bound up that it
is hard to separate one from the other.
