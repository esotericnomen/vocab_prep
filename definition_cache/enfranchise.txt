The verb enfranchise is used when a group of people are given voting rights or freedoms they didn't
have before. Many people under the age of 18 would like lawmakers to enfranchise their peer group so
they can vote.

Enfranchise traces back to the Old French word enfranchiss, a combination of en-, meaning make, put
in, and enfranchir, meaning to set or make free. In the 1680s, enfranchise came to mean to admit to
membership in a state, something that usually came with the right to vote. You may know the word
disenfranchised, an adjective that describes people who lack rights or liberties. To enfranchise is
to give or restore rights to the disenfranchised.
