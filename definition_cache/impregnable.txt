When something is impregnable it is not easily taken by force and can stand up to any attack. We
usually use it in reference to some form of protection, like a fort or a solid defensive line in
football.

The genealogy of the adjective impregnable includes the Middle French word prenable, meaning
vulnerable, easily conquered, which itself came from the verb prendre, which meant to take. The
addition of the negative prefix im- flipped the meaning. Impregnable can be used to describe
anything that cannot be entered or successfully attacked. Seventeenth-century theater critic Jeremy
Collier once said, True courage is a result of reasoning. A brave mind is always impregnable.
