Anything automotive has to do with automobiles — in other words, cars. The automotive industry,
for example, is all about making and selling cars. If the windshield wipers fall off your car, get
new ones at an automotive store.

The word automotive comes from the Greek auto for “self” and motive for “moving, which makes
sense for what the word may have meant in the late 1800s — a self-propelled helicopter-like
machine for one person. Don’t bother looking for one of those, though, automotive now just refers
to car stuff. If you're interested in automotive technology, you might become a mechanic. Or maybe
you could figure out how to make one of those little helicopters.
