To repeal something — usually a law, ordinance or public policy — is to take it back.  For
example, dog lovers might want the town council to repeal the law that says residents can have no
more than four dogs.

The verb repeal comes from the Anglo-French word repeler, “to call back.” Repeal is almost
always used in the context of law: When a government decides to get rid of an ordinance or law, that
ordinance or law is repealed. That means it is no longer in effect, like if the weather becomes
unseasonably hot, the schools might repeal the part of the dress code to permit students to wear
shorts.
