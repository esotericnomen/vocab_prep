Doctrine means a belief or set of beliefs. The idea that a man named Jesus was the son of God is
part of the Christian doctrine.

The policy that President Monroe introduced in 1823, stating that the United States should only mess
with European countries that set up new colonies in the Americas was the Monroe Doctrine, and it
remained an important part of US foreign policy straight through World War I. Doctrine and doctor
derive from the same Latin word, docere, which means to teach: doctor means teacher, and doctrina
means teaching, learning.
