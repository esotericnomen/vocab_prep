A sojourn is a short stay or visit. If you want a fancy way to say that you took a trip to the
countryside, you might talk about your country sojourn.

The verb is originally from the Latin prefix sub- under plus diurnus of a day. You might refer to
your vacation as a sojourn, but it might make more sense if you are describing a trip to Provence
rather than a trip to Disney World. Or In figurative use, sojourn means to
delveâ&euro;&ldquo;â&euro;&ldquo;your math teacher may stop midway through lessons on fractions
for a brief sojourn into techniques for slicing pie.
