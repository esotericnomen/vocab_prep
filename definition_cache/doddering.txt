Doddering means physically or mentally impaired due to old age, like a doddering person who can no
longer live alone without assistance from family members or a visiting nurse.

The adjective doddering comes from the Middle English word daderen to quake, tremble. That
shakiness, in movement and even in thoughts, is one quality of doddering people. It is important to
be patient with those who are doddering, because like the word sounds, they are trying to still be
mobile, still be part of the world around them, even if they feel more shaky as they get older.
