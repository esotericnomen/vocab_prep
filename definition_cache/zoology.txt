If you're fascinated by monkey business or just love horsing around, you might consider a career in
zoology â€” the scientific study of animals.

According to some usage experts, most of us mispronounce the word zoology. The first syllable of
this noun is correctly pronounced with a long o sound, as in toe, rather than the oo in zoo. Yet our
error is considered acceptable because if you're going to study animal life and behavior, one of the
best places to do it is at the zoo.
