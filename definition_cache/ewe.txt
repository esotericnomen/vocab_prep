At last, a word that only means one thing: a female sheep.  A ewe is a sheep that is female. That is
what a ewe is.

Most people have precious few opportunities to use the word ewe. For most of us, it's most valuable
as a three-letter word for crossword puzzles. For example: 1-down:  a three-letter word meaning
female sheep. Answer? Ewe! Also, if you're an avid Scrabble player, ewe is a good word to keep up
your sleeve. That W can rake in some serious points if you put it on a triple-word space. Finally,
punster's will enjoy using ewe in a sentence like “you and I will go see the ewe and him” —
which has the two of us going to see some guy and his female sheep.
