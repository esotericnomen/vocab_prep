Grisly means disgusting and bloody, absolutely repulsive and horrible. There’s a wonderfully
creepy movie about a man who suffers a grisly death at the hands of the grizzly bears he was
studying.

Do you like grisly horror movies? You might think that the reason the word grisly is so creepy,
gruesome, and terrifying is somehow related to gristle, those really nasty tough parts you find in
meat. But no, this is not the case. Old English grislic, the root of the word, means horrible,
dreadful. If something is gory and gross, it’s grisly.
