Even though lackadaisical sounds like it has something to do with a shortage of daisies, know that
what it really means is lacking in spirit or liveliness.

A person with a lackadaisical attitude shows no enthusiasm and puts forth a half-hearted effort. But
it's more of a dreamy, laid back approach rather than sheer laziness. This funny-sounding adjective
came about in the eighteenth century from the interjection lackaday, which was an old fashioned way
of saying oh man! or unfortunately.
