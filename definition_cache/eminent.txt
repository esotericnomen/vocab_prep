Anyone highly regarded or prominent is eminent. People that are eminent are giants in their field.

People who are impressive, famous, or accomplished are eminent. Every field has eminent people. In
the history of professional basketball, two of the most eminent coaches are Red Auerbach and Phil
Jackson, because they've won the most championships. In music, no one is more eminent than
Beethoven. The most successful architects are eminent. Eminent people loom over a field: they're
influential and you can't avoid hearing about them. It's not easy to be eminent: you have to be
extremely successful.
