When you're careless about something, you're not giving it much attention or consideration. If
you're careless about mowing the lawn, you might mow over your mother's prized daffodils without
even noticing.

When you say, I couldn't care less about something, you're probably going to be pretty careless
about it, too. If you couldnâ&euro;&trade;t care less about your homework, then you'll approach it
in a careless manner, without much thought or concentration.  Careless is negative, but
itâ&euro;&trade;s a little less so when it means effortless and unstudied, the way you might bat
away a bug with a careless swat. Interestingly, the root meaning of care is grief, so careless is
without grief.
