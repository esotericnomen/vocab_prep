The adjective stilted describes something—usually a style of writing or speaking—that is
unnaturally formal. It also refers to something raised on stilts, such as some lake houses that are
stilted, or resting on stilts over the water.

Imagine someone walking awkwardly on a pair of stilts and you have a good impression of the word
stilted — wooden and stiff. Stilt is found in the mid-15th century, referring to walking on wooden
stilts across marshy ground. A hundred years later, the word stilted came to refer to the posts
holding up a building. It wasn't until 1820 that the word was used as we use it now, to describe
writing that does not flow smoothly.
