If you enjoy the vernal lushness of the landscape, that’s a kind of fancy way to say you like the
way nature looks in the springtime.

The word vernal entered English in the sixteenth century, tracing all the way back to the Latin word
ver, meaning spring. Use the adjective vernal to describe something that occurs in springtime or is
related to springtime. You might be familiar with the vernal equinox, which indicates the beginning
of spring in the Northern Hemisphere. The word vernal can also be used more broadly to describe
something youthful or fresh — springlike.
