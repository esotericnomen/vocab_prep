Bouillon is a clear broth made by simmering meat, fish or vegetables in water with herbs. A nice cup
of bouillon will make you feel better if you have a cold or a stomachache.

Bouillon comes from a 17th-century French word that means liquid in which something has been boiled.
It is a common base for soups and stocks. Real cooks may turn up their noses, but if you don't have
time to make your own, you can always use bouillon cubes when making soups and sauces. Don't confuse
this word with bullion, a term for gold or silver in the form of bars or ingots.
