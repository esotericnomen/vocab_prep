Use the adjective exorbitant when you want to describe something that is really just too much!
You'll often hear people griping about exorbitant bank fees or exorbitant interest rates.

The adjective exorbitant was originally a legal term to describe a case that was outside the bounds
of the law. It comes from the Latin roots Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; the prefix ex, meaning out of, and orbita,
meaning wheel track. You can see how the word now has come to be described as something that has
gone way off the beaten track, especially in terms of price and value.
