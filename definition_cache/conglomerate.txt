A conglomerate is a group of things, especially companies, put together to form one. If you are rich
enough to buy a TV network, a record company, several newspapers, and a radio station, you too can
own a media conglomerate.

The root of conglomerate is glomus, a Latin word for “ball.” So think of a conglomerate as a
bunch of different things balled together. Before it came to describe giant corporations, a
conglomerate  was a rock formed from different kinds of minerals. Conglomerate can also be used as a
verb — like when your media companies conglomerated successfully.
