When you can't keep up with your fellow marathon runners, you can say that you lag behind them.

The word lag describes a kind of slowness or delay. As a noun, it means a slowing: The coach was
disappointed by the lag in her swimmers' best times that day. When you lag behind someone, you fall
back or don't measure up. A student who struggles with math, for example, might say that his grades
lag behind his best friend's. In the 1550s, lag meant last person.
