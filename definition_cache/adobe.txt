If you've ever visited New Mexico and noticed earthy looking buildings everywhere, chances are
they're made from adobe, a type of brick that's dried in the sun.

The noun adobe originates from the oral form of Arabic al-tob, meaning the brick, which is derived
from the Coptic word tube, meaning brick. In hot, dry climates like the American Southwest, Africa,
and Spain, you'll often see buildings made of adobe. The word adobe can also refer to the material
that these bricks are made of. The clay, water, and straw that go into the material give the bricks
a natural-looking, informal appearance.
