If something is complementary, then it somehow completes or enhances the qualities of something
else. If your beautiful voice is completely complimentary to your brother's song writing skills, you
should form a family band!

You’ve probably heard of “complementary colors,” colors that are opposite in hue on the color
wheel but actually go well together. When combined, they make a harmonious palette. People’s
personalities can also be complementary, as can certain food pairings. But be careful not to confuse
this adjective with the closely spelled complimentary, which means “supplied free of charge.”
