When you slink, you move in a deliberately quiet and sneaky way. You might slink into your physics
class, hoping the teacher won't notice how late you are.

Kids playing hide and seek will sometimes slink around the house, quietly searching for good hiding
spots, and wild animals tend to slink through the woods or fields when they're stalking prey or
trying to avoid becoming prey themselves. Slink comes from the Old English word slincan, to creep or
crawl, which was mostly used to describe the movements of reptiles.
