The verb pique means to make someone angry or annoyed. But when something piques your interest or
curiosity, here the verb pique just means to arouse, stimulate, or excite.

Both the noun and verb are pronounced pēk and were borrowed from a French word meaning a prick,
irritation, from Old French, from piquer to prick. So you can see how something that pricks you
could make you both excited and angry. But it's frustrating––enough to make you want to storm
away from learning vocab. That storming away, by the by, might be called a fit of pique.
