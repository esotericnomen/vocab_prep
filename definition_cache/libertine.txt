If you drink a lot, eat a lot, and live a wild and unrestrained life, you might be called a
libertine.

A libertine is someone who lives life unencumbered by morals. Although it can be use neutrally,
often if someone calls you libertine, they disapprove of your lack of morality. The city of New
Orleans, where the drinking age is 18 and prostitution is legal, might be called a libertine city.
While not all of the people who live there are libertines, they tend to have libertine attitudes and
views, and do not mind when tourists spend their money on libertine activity.
