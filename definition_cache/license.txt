What does 007's license to kill have to do with that driver's license you can't wait to acquire?
Both are forms of permissions conferred officially. If you’re in England, the noun ends in
“c,” as in driver’s licence.

When you have a license, you have official permission to do something, like drive a car. Bars need a
liquor license to serve alcohol. Doctors need a medical license to practice medicine. You can also
say people have license to do something, which means they're free to do it, like if you give
yourself poetic license to misspell your own name. In Britain, license is only a verb, meaning
allow, and the noun form is spelled with two cs: licence.
