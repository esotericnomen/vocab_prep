Ever seen pictures in children’s books of wizened little trolls with red caps and wrinkled faces?
Those are gnomes, imaginary characters popular in fairy tales and folklore. For some reason,
they’ve lately become popular as garden statuary.

The gnome, a dwarf-like inhabitant of the earth, has long captured the imagination of children and
adults alike — witness the popularity of gnome statues in gardens. Appropriately, the word gnome
is perhaps (just perhaps!) from gēnomos, an unrecorded Greek word for earth-dweller. Credit for the
word is given to 16th-century Swiss alchemist Paracelsus. The red-capped creatures entered German
and Swiss folklore, and in the 19th century became part of children's literature, usually serving as
the guardians of various treasures.
