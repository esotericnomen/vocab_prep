With brazen disregard for the sign that said no cellphones please the woman took a long call in the
doctor's office waiting room. Brazen refers to something shocking, done shamelessly.

The Middle English word was brasen made of brass, from Old English brĂŚsen, from brĂŚs brass. In
fact a near synonym of brazen is our English word brassy, which has the additional meaning of being
loud and showy.
