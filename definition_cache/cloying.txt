If you’re a cynic who favors dark, edgy humor and thrillers, you probably find romantic comedies
with their hearts, flowers, and sappy happy endings cloying — so sweet and sentimental that they
make you want to retch.

Whether you’re talking about dessert wine or love notes, cloying means sickeningly sweet. It’s
how folks who love espresso feel about Frappuccino. Cloying comes in handy to describe things that
are too sweet both literally. Don’t worry about him trying to kiss you; your cloying perfume is
sure to keep him at arm’s length. Or figuratively. Your incessant flattery and cloying way of
hanging on my every word was charming at first, but now I wish you’d go away.
