Continence refers to self control. It’s the ability to hold it all in.

The word continence come from the Latin continentia which means a holding back.” It hasn’t
changed much — continence means holding back bodily functions. It’s often used in the negative,
incontinence, which describes a situation you get into with babies or sick people, where they
can’t control their bowels. In another sense, continence is a little like abstinence, but while
abstinence is refraining from sex, usually for a religious reason, continence refers to the ability
to do so.
