To powwow or have a powwow is to have a quick meeting. People powwow when they need to discuss
something.

Originally, powwow was a Native American term for a type of meeting or council. The term has since
become a more general term for meetings and conferences, especially brief ones. Football players in
a huddle are having a powwow. Two police officers may powwow before approaching a suspect. Anytime
there's something to discuss and debate, you might need to powwow. At the end of a powwow, you
should come to some kind of decision.
