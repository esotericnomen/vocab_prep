Victuals are anything that can be used as food. Even that plate of mystery meat that the lunch lady
just gave you could be considered victuals.

You won't hear many people these days talking about packing their fridge with victuals. Actually
pronounced vittles, it's an old fashioned word for food that sounds like it belongs in a black and
white western movie. And it certainly has some dusty roots Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; word nerds can trace
victuals all the way back to the Latin words for nourishment, livelihood and sustenance.
