To hibernate means to take a season-long snooze. When a bear crawls into a cave with a belly full of
food ready to sleep through the cold winter, that bear is going to hibernate until spring.

Animals that sleep through the winter, like bears, squirrels, rodents and even some rattlesnakes,
are said to hibernate through the winter. This word can also be used to describe any kind of
inactive or dormant state, especially for the purpose of getting rest. If you’ve had a tough week
and you’re planning to shut down and hole up in your house for the weekend, you could say you’re
going to hibernate this weekend.
