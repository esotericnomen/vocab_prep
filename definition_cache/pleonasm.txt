Pleonasm is using more words than you need to, either accidentally or deliberately. An example of
pleonasm? She picked up the tiny little baby kitten.

The Greek root word in pleonasm is pleonazein, which describes something as more than enough. Used
accidentally, a pleonasm is just long-winded wordiness, like a sentence that includes far more words
than is necessary. Used on purpose, pleonasm is a tool used by writers and speakers to emphasize
something or clarify an idea through repetition. This helps audiences remember main ideas as they
listen or read.
