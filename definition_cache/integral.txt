Something that is integral is very important or necessary. If you are an integral part of the team,
it means that the team cannot function without you.

An integral part is necessary to complete the whole. In this sense, the word essential is a near
synonym. In mathematics, there are integrals of functions and equations. Integral is from Middle
English, from Medieval Latin integralis making up a whole, from Latin  integer untouched, entire.
