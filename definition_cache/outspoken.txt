If you often freely speak your mind, people may say that you are outspoken. How people view that
particular trait in you, however, will depend on whether they agree with what you have to say or
not!

Use the adjective outspoken to describe someone candid and blunt, one who is direct in manner or
speech. If you are an outspoken advocate for arts education in schools, you probably attend lots of
school board and community meetings trying to ensure that the board does not cut music and drama
from the school curriculum. If you are an outspoken critic of the way your boss does his job, you
may not have yours much longer!
