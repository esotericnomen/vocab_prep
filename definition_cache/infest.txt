The verb infest means to invade in large number, often resisting control and causing damage or
hardship. Bedbugs can infest people's belongings and even their bodies, or mice may infest your
kitchen if you leave the cheese out too often.

Infest comes from Latin: in- means not and festus means able to be seized. So infest describes
something is not able to be seized, typically because it's present in such large numbers. For
example, mosquitoes may infest your backyard during the summer and annoy you when you're trying to
relax. Infest is usually used to describe pests, such as bugs or rodents, that overrun something in
such large number that they are difficult to control.
