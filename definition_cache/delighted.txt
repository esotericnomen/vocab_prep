You can use the adjective delighted to describe being really pleased or happy with something. Maybe
you would be stoked about getting backstage passes to a concert, while someone getting backstage
passes to the symphony would be delighted.

Delighted might be a slightly old-fashioned way to show excitement or enthusiasm, or maybe it's a
more refined way to express how you feel. Saying, Oh, I'm so delighted you decided to come! was once
a common way to show how happy you were to see a friend. More contemporary uses might be sarcastic,
like when you hand your mom an armload of stinky gym clothes without a Please and she says I'll be
delighted to wash these for you!
