A canker is something terrible that is hard to get rid of. Think of how you feel about the canker
sore in your mouth. Drug use is a canker on our society, destroying lives and families.

In medicine, cankers are ulcers that are difficult to treat (the word is closely related to cancer).
In agriculture, they are a disease that attacks the bark of apple trees. If one kid in your class
misbehaves, and everyone suddenly follows his lead, that kid could be described (by your teachers)
as a canker.
