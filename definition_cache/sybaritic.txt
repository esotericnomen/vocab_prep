Because of its endless sybaritic (indulgent or luxurious) amenities, Dubai has emerged in the early
21st century as a vacation destination for the wealthy and ostentatious.

Sybaritic looks like a complicated word, but to pronounce it, just think of the “sib” in the
word sibling,  then “uh,” then the “-ritic” of the word critic. One way to remember the
pronunciation is a rhyme: not even the harshest travel writer or restaurant critic ever turns down
the sybaritic pleasures of Las Vegas.
