Sophistry is tricking someone by making a seemingly clever argument, such as telling your mom you
must have candy before dinner because if you don't you'll die and then the protein and vitamins
won't get eaten at all.

who uses it sound like a Puritanical fanatic insisting that something like gum-chewing is the path
to the devil. But we are certainly still surrounded by examples of
sophistryâ&euro;&ldquo;â&euro;&ldquo;just turn on the TV and watch an ad. You'll see plenty.
