An outcast is someone who isn't wanted. To remember what outcast means, flip it around: outcasts
have been cast out from somewhere.

No one wants to be an outcast: such people are rejected by their peers. We all feel like outcasts
sometimes. For example, if no one wants to sit with you at lunch, you will probably feel like an
outcast. There are much more serious cases too: if a person is thrown out of a community or country,
they are considered an outcast (or an exile).
