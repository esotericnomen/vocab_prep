Everyone who has ever taken a science class knows the word hypothesis, which means an idea, or a
guess, that you are going to test through an experiment. A hypothetical is related to that. It means
something based on an informed guess.

Hypotheticals are fun. How would you do in a hypothetical arm-wrestling competition against your
Grandma? There are people in the Pentagon whose jobs are to consider all kinds of
hypotheticalsâ&euro;&ldquo;â&euro;&ldquo;what if Luxembourg armed itself with nuclear weapons?
What if France developed the ability to pelt Switzerland with cannons firing cheeses?
