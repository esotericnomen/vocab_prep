To maim something is to disfigure it through force or violence. Wartime battles have a tendency to
maim soldiers.

The verb maim is related to mayhem, which, historically, was the act of hurting another person so
badly that they couldnâ&euro;&trade;t defend themselves. To maim a person or animal, even if
itâ&euro;&trade;s an accident, is to render them defenseless or disfigured, and it frequently
includes the loss of a limb. The goal of driving defensively is to avoid an accident that could maim
you, your passengers, or other people on the road.
