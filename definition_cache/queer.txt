Queer originally just meant weird, but it's unfortunately evolved into an offensive term for
homosexual.

Like many words, queer has many meanings. One is odd, as in I feel kind of queer today. The other is
gay. Calling someone queer is a slur: it has about the same meaning and level of offensiveness as
fag. As a verb, queering can mean to endanger or expose to risk, and also to hinder, thwart, foil,
or baffle. As usual, you can figure out which meaning of queer someone intends by the other words
around it.
