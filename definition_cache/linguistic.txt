Use the adjective linguistic to describe anything related to language, like the linguistic
difficulties you might have if you visit a place where you do not speak the same language as
everyone else.

The word linguistic combines the noun linguist, meaning a master of language, one who uses his
tongue freely, with the adjective suffix -ic. It describes something that√¢&euro;&trade;s related to
language, such as a linguistic theory about why some people drop the g sound in saying words ending
in -ing. Or, if you want to brag about how good your vocabulary is, then rave about your linguistic
skills.
