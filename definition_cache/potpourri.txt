The noun potpourri can refer to a mixture or collection of seemingly unrelated items, an unusual
assortment. You may own a potpourri of books â€” from classic literature to trashy novels and from
Shakespeare's plays to comic books.

The noun potpourri often refers to a scented mixture of spices and dried flowers that is usually
kept in a decorative bowl or jar and used to perfume a room. What's interesting is that the name for
this attractively fragrant mixture comes from the French phrase pot pourri, which literally means
rotten pot. The phrase was used to describe a stew. Clearly, some things translate better than
others.
