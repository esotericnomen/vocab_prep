A polygamist is a person who has one than one spouse, such as a polygamist who has three wives and
15 children.

Having more than one spouse, a polygamist is a busy person. Polygamist comes from the Greek: poly-
means many and gamos means marriage. So by definition, a polygamist can be a man with multiple wives
or a woman with multiple husbands. The thing to remember is that the marriages are on-going. A
person who gets a divorce and is later remarried is not a polygamist.
