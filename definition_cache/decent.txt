The adjective decent means sufficient or acceptable. The local diner you like to frequent may not
serve a four-star breakfast, but it probably has decent food.

Though the concept is a little dated, people of decent society are socially correct. They don't
break the law, behave rudely, use impolite language, or wear inappropriate clothing. Decent can also
mean nice: Holding the door for a woman with a stroller is the decent thing to do. Lastly, decent
can also mean appropriately clothed (or just not naked). If a stranger is knocking on your door,
you're probably not going to answer it until you're decent.
