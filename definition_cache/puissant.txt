Puissant means powerful and in possession of authority, and is often used to describe the political
power of someone, like a prince or president.

Said the English poet, historian, and arguably puissant scholar John Milton, â&euro;&oelig;Methinks
I see in my mind a noble and puissant nation rousing herself like a strong man after sleep, and
shaking her invincible locks.â&euro;? Synonyms for this somewhat rarely used adjective include
forcible, mighty, strong, steady, unyielding, and vigorous.
