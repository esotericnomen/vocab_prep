A crypt is a vault for burying the dead, which is often underneath or part of a church building.
Crypt rhymes with gripped, and if you saw a corpse come out of a crypt, you would definitely be
gripped with terror.

While a coffin is a rectangular box used for burying dead people underground, a crypt is often an
elaborate stone or marble vault that's above ground. Some cultures believe in investing in large,
decorated crypts to honor the dead, while others choose simpler chambers very close together for
keeping family members near, even in death. A crypt can inspire scary thoughts of lids popping and
doors opening for the walking dead, but that's due mostly to the widespread crypt scenes in horror
movies. Mostly.
