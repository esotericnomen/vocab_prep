Repertoire refers to the full supply of what you can do. A singer's repertoire is all the songs they
can sing. A chef's repertoire is what she knows how to cook.

Repertoire was borrowed from French rĂŠpertoire, from Late Latin repertorium an inventory. The
Late Latin word is also the source of English repertory, a group of actors that perform many plays,
each performed for a short time. The second r in both repertoire and repertory is often not
pronounced.
