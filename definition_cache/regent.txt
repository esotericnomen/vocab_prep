In a monarchy, if the king gets too sick to rule his country, a regent steps in to run things
temporarily.

When kings or queens aren't able to do their jobs â&euro;&rdquo; because they're ill, or often
because they are children â&euro;&rdquo; trusted advisers called regents fill in. You can think of
a regent as a substitute monarch. There's also a more permanent kind of regent who helps to run a
business or university and can also be called a trustee or board member. In Latin, regent means
ruling, from the verb regere, to rule.
