Ignoble means not noble, but for those of us that don’t live in feudal England and don’t worry
about lords or peasants, ignoble just means base, or low, like that dude in Biology who’s always
telling fart jokes.

Ignoble means low, common, or humble, but we tend to use it to describe the lows of human nature,
rather than economically humble people or places. So a picturesquely crumbing rustic cottage or a
cool old diner is not ignoble, but perhaps a sketchy roadside bar is. Those that think that the
human mind is the treasure of the world disdain ignoble animals like pigs or dogs––after all,
they can’t compose lovely poems like we can.
