When making the plans for your new house, consider adding a rotunda, or a round room. It will give
the house a grand appearance and also allow you to walk in circles as much as you please.

You may have heard the adjective rotund to describe a person with a round shape. Rotunda, with an -a
at the end, is a noun that refers to a type of building or room that is round and often has a dome
on top. Rotundas are often found as part of large, important buildings such as capitol buildings and
museums.
