A spectrum is a broad range of similar things or qualities. Like the wide spectrum of political
beliefs in this country, ranging anywhere from super conservative to uber-liberal and everything in
between.

Our modern definition of spectrum started out in the 1600s, when scientists used it to refer to the
band of colors formed by a beam of light, like a rainbow. In physics, it√¢&euro;&trade;s a word that
describes the distribution of something, like energy or atomic particles. We still use those
scientific meanings today, but spectrum can also apply to non-science related groupings or ranges of
related things.
