If you want to get someone to like you, don't offer to fetch them a Coke, rub their feet, or do
their homework. They won't like you any better, and your servile attitude will only cost you their
respect.

To remember servile, just think of the word servantâ&euro;&ldquo;â&euro;&ldquo;they both derive
from the Latin servus slave. In fact, servile also means anything characteristic of a slave. After
winning the lottery, the ex-slave shed first his servile clothes, later his servile manner. The
transformation was complete.
