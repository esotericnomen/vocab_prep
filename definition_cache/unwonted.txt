Unwonted is a pretty old-fashioned word now, meaning something unusual or out of the ordinary.
Nowadays, unwonted is a pretty unwonted word itself.

Unwonted was once a particularly beloved literary term, favored by authors like Henry James and
Charles Dickens, whose books were filled with unwonted circumstances, and the like. Not to be
confused â&euro;&rdquo; as it often is â&euro;&rdquo; with unwanted, meaning not wanted or
desired. The confusion arises not just because the words sound identical, but because their meanings
overlap: it's a safe bet that anything unwonted is generally unwanted, too.
