The adjective outgoing describes someone with a friendly, easy personality. Your outgoing friend
might not understand how hard it is for shy people to speak in front of an audience.

If you're the only member of your outgoing family who is reserved, you might feel silent and
invisible in their sociable midst. People who are outgoing are perfectly comfortable in social
situations. A completely different meaning of outgoing describes someone who is departing, like an
employee who will soon retire, or an outgoing club treasurer who isn't running for re-election.
