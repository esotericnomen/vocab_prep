Although smart is most often used to describe someone who is intelligent, you can also call someone
a smart, chic dresser or a smart, sassy wisecracker.

Smart often implies something good, but not always.  If someone cautions you, Don't be smart with
me! Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; they are demanding that you stop acting so bold and rude. As a verb, if
something smarts, then it hurts. If your knee smarts, then you probably whacked it. However, if
someone says that you are a smart dresser or a smart thinker, you can take those comments as
compliments.
