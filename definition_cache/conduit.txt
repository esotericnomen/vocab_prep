Instead of complaining about your chores, be grateful for the conduit, or pipe, that brings water to
your home. Thanks to it, you don't have to go fetch water from the well whenever your mom wants a
cup of coffee.

The noun conduit comes from root words meaning pipe, and the word retains this definition. For
example, a channel between a reservoir and a water treatment plant could be called a conduit.
Conduit can also be used in a figurative sense to refer to someone or something that conveys goods,
information, or ideas. For instance, a religious leader might be seen as a conduit who brings divine
messages to the people.
