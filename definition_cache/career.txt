You may have to take jobs as a dog walker, cat groomer, and fish feeder before you complete school
for a career as a veterinarian. Small jobs in the short term give you experience for a long-term
career.

Career comes from the French carriĂ¨re, from an older word for street or road. Staying on track
for a certain career is like driving a car in one direction on a road, instead of veering in
different directions. Maybe the expression career path is helpful in remembering that a career is
something that progresses, or moves forward on a set path. It can also be used as a verb to describe
something moving quickly and uncontrollably, like a car careering into a ditch.
