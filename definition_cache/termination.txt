Whether it refers to getting fired from a job, a contract running out, or the assassination of a
deep-cover spy, termination is the end of the line.

You may be familiar with a certain time-traveling cyborg assassin, played by Arnold Schwarzenegger.
His character was a terminator, in a movie of the same name, and his goal was the termination of
Sarah Connor. Lucky for Sarah, and the supposed future of our planet, the termination was
unsuccessful. In the real world, you're more likely to see the word termination used when a
contract, program, or job comes to an end, unexpectedly or as planned.
