Wanton describes something excessive, uncontrolled and sometimes even cruel. The principal sees a
food fight as a wanton act of vandalism done with wanton disregard for the rules, but the kids might
just see it as fun.

Wanton comes from the Old English wan- lacking and togen to train, discipline, in other words,
lacking in discipline. Wanton extravagance is excessive and uncontrolled, whereas a wanton act of
terrorism is random and intentionally cruel. Sometimes in older novels, you will see wanton used as
a disapproving term to describe a sexually active women, a usage that is considered old-fashioned
today.
