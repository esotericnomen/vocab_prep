A plane is a vehicle that flies through the air, but it is also a tool used to make something smooth
and flat, a kind of tree or a level surface. As a verb, to plane something is to make it flat and
smooth.

Don't confuse plane with plain, an adjective that means simple or a noun that means flat land, like
the plains of the American Midwest. This can be tricky because plane describes something that is
flat and level, or the tool or action that makes something flat and level. If you remember that
plain applies only to landforms, the difference will be plain to see Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; meaning
obvious.
