Something fraudulent is intentionally false and meant to harm or deceive. That email message from
the Sultan of Brunei offering you millions of dollars just might be fraudulent.

From the fact that the word fraudulent is frequently teamed with the word scheme, you can get the
idea that something fraudulent is sneaky, snarky, and just plain wrong. A fraudulent scheme is one
designed to gain something at the expense of someone else. It might be small — trying to use an
expired coupon — or bigger — lying on your taxes. Whatever its form, planning something
fraudulent is cheating, and it's wrong.
