Discombobulate is a fun, fancy word for “confuse.” If something has put you in a state where you
don't know up from down and you can't spell your own name, you may be discombobulated.

Discombobulate kind of sounds like you feel when you're disoriented: bouncing around in several
directions at once. Trying to say discombobulate for the first time might discombobulate you!
Because of its funny sound, discombobulate is often used in a humorous way. Are you ready to
assemble some furniture, or are you too discombobulated after reading the instructions?
