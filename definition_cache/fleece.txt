A fleece is a sheep's coat.  Or a goat's. Or a yak's. A person's coat can be called a fleece, too,
if it comes from a sheep or goat or a yak or even if it just looks like it did.

You can also use fleece in an informal way to mean cheating someone.  Remember how Mary had a little
lamb whose fleece was white as snow?  Well, it was such a nice, clean fleece that Mary tricked the
lamb into trusting her, then robbed him of his fleece and turned it into a bomber jacket and a pair
of boots. She totally fleeced him!
