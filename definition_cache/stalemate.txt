A stalemate is an impasse in a contest, a point where neither player — usually in chess — can
win or lose.

Stalemate is from an Old French word, estal, which means “place,” “position,” or
“stand.” To be in a stalemate with an opponent is to be in a locked position, or a stalled
place, where neither player can make a profitable move. Chess is the most common context for a
stalemate, but any contest or negotiation can result in a stalemate: The discussions about buying
their competitor’s waffle house reached a stalemate and the deal died.
