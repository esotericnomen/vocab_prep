When someone does something in a slipshod manner, they do it in a way that's careless and sloppy â€”
that isn't right.

An easy way to remember the meaning of slipshod is to note that shod is part of shoddy, another word
for slipshod. (Alert: despite their similarity, slipshod isn't genetically related to shoddy.) Or
you can use slip to clue yourself in. Originally, someone who looked slipshod was wearing worn-out
slippers: they were shod in slippers.
