The adjective enchanted describes something that's under a spell, like the frog that lives in your
backyard which, when you kiss it, turns into a prince.

The Latin root, incantare, means cast a spell on.If you're so captivated by something, like stunning
photographs in an art gallery, that you may as well be under a fairy tale spell, you're enchanted.
Charming actors in old movies often say, Enchanted, after being introduced to a beautiful woman.
What they mean, essentially, is that they find her so fascinating they can't take their eyes off
her.
