Precise means strictly correct or very exact. If you need something to be precise, like the
positioning of a safety net for a stunt jump over a canyon, there's no room for error.

The word precise might make you think of nerdy scientists with rulers or stiff accountants double
checking their calculations. But being precise, or painstakingly accurate, has its merits. When
making a grilled cheese sandwich, for example, it√¢&euro;&trade;s important that the arrangement of
ingredients be precise: Place a tomato in each corner and ensure that the cheese covers every inch
of bread so that each bite is full of gooey delight.
