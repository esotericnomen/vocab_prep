Transpire is a fancy way of saying happen. What's transpiring? — however — just doesn't have the
same ring as What's happening?

Originally used to express when information became known or came to light, many purists will tell
you that's really the best way to use transpire. It can also mean releasing vapor into the air, like
when a plant transpires water through its leaves on a hot day. Note: you'll usually encounter this
word in its past tense: for example, We had to watch the replay to figure out what had transpired.
