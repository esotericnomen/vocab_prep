Line has many meanings, most stemming from the basic idea of something unbroken and often straight.
It might be the line you wait in at the market, or just a connection of two points.

The original meaning of line came from the Latin word linea, or â&euro;&oelig;linen
thread.â&euro;?  Your career is also your line of work.  Since you're an engineer, you might say
that's not in my line if you are asked to bake a cake.  A pick-up line is something you might hear
from a person at a party who's flirting with you.  It will probably be corny.
