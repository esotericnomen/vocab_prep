Technically, a diva is a big-time female opera star. Beverly Sills and Maria Callas were two of the
world's most renowned divas. More commonly, though, we call anyone who thinks they're more fabulous
than everyone else a diva.

The word diva was a compliment, one reserved for only the greatest singers in the world. Lately,
though, diva has come to describe someone that's acting entitled or holier than thou. A person who
acts like the world revolves around her is a diva. If you walk into a packed restaurant and demand
the best table snapping, Don't you know who I am?, well, that's diva behavior.
