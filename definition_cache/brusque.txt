If you ask a salesperson with help finding something and all you get in response is a brusque
Everything's out on the shelves, you'll probably take your business elsewhere. A brusque manner of
speaking is unfriendly, rude, and very brief.

Brush and brusque are not related, but they sound similarâ&euro;&ldquo;â&euro;&ldquo;when someone
is brusque, you often feel that they are trying to give you the brush off. Near synonyms for brusque
are curt, short, and gruff. Brusque (pronounced brusk) was borrowed from the French word meaning
lively, fierce, from Italian brusco coarse, rough.
