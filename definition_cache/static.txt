Static means not moving or changing––it's often used to describe abstract ideas that can't be
seen. The troops were moving all over the country, engaged in skirmishes, but the army's overall
position remained static.

Static is easier to remember if you think of the sta- in standing still and stationary. Remember
what happens when you rub a balloon against your head? That's producing a stationary electric
charge, otherwise known as static electricity.
