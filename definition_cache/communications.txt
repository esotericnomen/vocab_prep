The field of communications has to do with TV, radio, print media, the Internet and other ways that
people share information with each other.

The word communicate should be a big clue to what communications is all about. Communications
involves all the ways people get information and entertainment to each other. A communications major
in college might major in journalism, broadcasting, or something else related to getting the word
out (maybe even social media). Without communications â&euro;&rdquo; also known as media
â&euro;&rdquo; we'd have no clue about the things going on in the world.
