The adjective propulsive describes something that has the power to drive something forward. You
would not want a propulsive jet engine on your model airplane — it’s just too much power for
something that should stay in the basement.

You can think of propulsive as describing an object that has propellers (like a helicopter) that
move it forward. But the word propulsive is not just for the literal. Use propulsive to make a
description more colorful and imaginative. The word suggests a feeling of propelling, like hearing a
soaring melody with a propulsive rhythm or a propulsive speech that makes you want to change the
world.
