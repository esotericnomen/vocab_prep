A salvo is when troops fire their guns all at the same time. A salvo of shots might signal the
beginning of a military battle.

Another word for the gunfire kind of salvo is a volley. Military planners have used salvos as a way
to overwhelm an opposing army, including during engagements between battleships and tanks. You can
also use salvo in a more figurative way, describing a verbal barrage or attack: Her direct, almost
rude questions were seen as the opening salvo in the battle between the two political candidates.
