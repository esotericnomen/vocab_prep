Something that’s irrepressible can’t be restrained. If you find yourself constantly looking up
the definitions of interesting words, you have an irrepressible desire to expand your vocabulary.
You just can’t stop!

Irrepressible comes from the word repress, which means restrain or reject. If you have a desire to
become an actor but are worried about financial security, you might repress your calling for the
stage and opt for law school instead. However, some desires are simply irrepressible. If you ignore
your urge to be onstage, watch out; we predict that one day you’ll find yourself delivering a
Shakespearean monologue to a very confused jury.
