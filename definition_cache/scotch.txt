Don't get your hopes up: The verb to scotch has nothing to do with the well-known liquor. Instead,
it means to prevent or stop something from happening.

To scotch is, most often, to prevent plans, efforts, or desires â&euro;&rdquo; as opposed to things
â&euro;&rdquo; from coming about. You wouldn't say, for example, turning off the flame is one way
to scotch the steak. But you might say, Our plans for spending the weekend camping in the mountains
were scotched by the blizzard. No camping for us. Think of scotching as similar to throwing a wrench
into someone's plans. Drinking Scotch is one way to scotch your efforts to remain sober.
