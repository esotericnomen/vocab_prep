Diffuse mean spread out, or the action of spreading out. If lots of people in school believe
invisible angels are everywhere, you could say that opinion is diffuse. You might even think angels
are diffuse as well.

As a verb, diffuse means to spread something out, but also applies to spreading things such as ideas
or culture so that they become widely known. When something is diffused, it's mixed in, and when you
drop propaganda pamphlets out of airplanes you're diffusing the propaganda. The adjective comes from
Latin diffusus, from diffundere to pour in different directions, from the prefix dis- apart plus
fundere to pour.
