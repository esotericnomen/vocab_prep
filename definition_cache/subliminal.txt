Each of your five senses constantly sends new information to your brain. And there’s another way
your brain receives information: through subliminal messages. The unconscious mind picks up on
things you don’t even realize.

Faint humming might make you irritated. Red lights can raise your blood temperature. Usually,
subliminal methods are used to control people, like flashing words quickly during a television
program. If you’re worried, there’s not much you can do, because subliminal literally means
“below the threshold” or surface of your conscious mind, and you probably will never even notice
that you’re being controlled. Try reading only the capital letters of this definition for an
example of a subliminal message.
