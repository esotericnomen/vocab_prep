If you decide to leave the theater early to beat traffic, you’ll miss the finale — the exciting
final part of a theatrical performance.

Perhaps to ensure that audience members stay until the end, many musical and theatrical pieces end
with an elaborate flourish known as the finale. (If it’s truly spectacular, it might even be
called a “grand finale.”) Appropriately, the pronunciation of finale contains a final flourish
that you just can’t miss: the letter e, which you might expect to be silent, is pronounced. The
last two syllables of finale rhyme with alley.
