Some people have purebred dogs, but you might have a mongrel â€” a mutt that is part this, part
that, and part the other thing (but to you he's a 100 percent dog and your best friend).

Mongrel has the Middle English root word mong, which meant mix. If you use the word mongrel to refer
to the mixed ancestry of a dog or other animal, you may or may not intend to be insulting. If you
refer to a human as a mongrel, you are definitely making a pejorative comment about that person's
origins. In this use, it is considered an insult.
