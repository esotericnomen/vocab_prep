Call something weird when it’s strange, bizarre, or strikes you as odd. Putting peanut butter on
pizza is weird. So is most abstract, conceptual performance art.

Our definition of weird is rooted in Germanic mythology, where the “weird sisters” were three
funky-looking goddesses that controlled fate and destiny: We dropped the idea of destiny and clung
to how weird the weird sisters looked. In today’s slang we even use weird as a verb, as in “to
weird someone out” or make them feel uneasy.
