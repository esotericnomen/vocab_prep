Semblance is all about illusion. Cramming all of your dirty clothes into the closet gives the
semblance, or false appearance, that you've done your laundry â€” but the stench might give you
away.

Semblance comes from the 14th-century French word for resemble, and it is a noun for things that
look one way on the outside but are very different on the inside. A popular combination is to say
that a person or place has the semblance of order, when, underneath, everything is out of control.
