Ever wonder who writes dictionaries? They're called lexicographers. A lexicographer studies words
and compiles the results into a dictionary.

This is one of several words for a certain type of writer or editor. Just as a playwright writes
plays and a poet writes poems, a lexicographer puts together dictionaries. Lexicographer come up
with definitions, determines parts of speech, gives pronunciations, and sometimes provides example
sentences. Lexicographer need to do a lot of research to make sure they're defining a word
correctly; dictionaries are books that people need to trust. If you love words, you might enjoy
being a lexicographer.
