When you stamp, you step hard, either on the ground or on some object. If you're terrified of bugs,
you might be tempted to stamp on a big, weird looking beetle.

You can stamp your foot when you're angry, or stamp out a small campfire after you've finished
toasting marshmallows. Another way to stamp is to apply a mark or pattern to something
â&euro;&rdquo; you might stamp your classmates' hands with ink as they enter the school dance, or
stamp your return address onto an envelope. Stamp comes from Middle English, with a Germanic root
â&euro;&rdquo; it's closely related to the German word stampfen, or stamp with the foot.
