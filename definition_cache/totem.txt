A totem is an emblem or badge that features an animal or plant. Each totem represents a family,
clan, or tribe. Do you come from a long line of fishermen? Perhaps your family’s totem is a trout.

Any group can have a totem, but the word totem is from the Algonquian (Native American) word
odoodeman for his family mark. Totems are pictures — usually on badges or emblems — of animals
or plants that represent a group of people, especially an extended family or clan. A totem could be
a grizzly bear, oak tree, catfish, or just about any other living thing. Like a flag, a totem means
a lot to the people it represents.
