If you are earnest, it means you are serious about something. You parents might not want you to drop
out of school to follow some fly-by-night dream, but if you're earnest about wanting a career in
show biz, they'll support you.

If you are earnest, you pursue your purpose in a steady, sincere, and eager way. The phrase in
earnest uses earnest as a noun, as in, Once you stop fooling around and start studying in earnest,
you'll find you learn the material quickly. Oscar Wilde's classic play, The Importance of Being
Earnest, plays on the fact that Ernest is also a man's name.
