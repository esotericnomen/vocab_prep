Vestige is an elegant word. It's all about shadows, and gives us a way to talk about traces or
reminders of something that has disappeared or is disappearing.

Vestige derives from the Latin vestigium footprint, and that is a good way to think of
itâ&euro;&ldquo;â&euro;&ldquo;footprints in the sand. Sometimes vestige is used to emphasize the
complete lack of something. She told me she took the money from my wallet without the least vestige
of remorse in her voice or facial expression.
