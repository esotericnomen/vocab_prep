Baubles are trinkets or novelty items that cost little and arenâ€™t very important or valuable, such
as a plastic ring in the shape of a daisy that covers half of your finger in hot-pink plastic.

Baubles: the Mardi Gras beads you collected last year, the small statue of the Eiffel tower your
grandparents brought back from Paris, those big glass bulbs you use to decorate a Christmas tree, a
computer mouse made to look like a hamburger.
