Quizzical usually means puzzled or questioning, though it can also mean confused, surprised,
comical, or mocking. If someone's looking at you with a quizzical expression when you mention your
summer, it might mean they don't know about your adventures at space camp.

The word quiz tucked inside quizzical should help you remember the idea of questioning that this
adjective often suggests. The word also comes in handy to describe being eccentric or odd, as well
as skeptical or derisive. You raise a quizzical eyebrow every time you see me in my giant fur hat.
Does that mean you don√¢&euro;&trade;t like it?
