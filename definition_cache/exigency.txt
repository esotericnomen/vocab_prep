Think of a mix of excitement and emergency, and you have exigency, a sudden, urgent crisis. The very
word conjures up danger and intrigue that demand a cool head and an immediate effort at a solution.

The meaning of exigency is obvious from its source, the Latin noun exigentia, which means urgency
and comes from the verb exigere, meaning to demand or require. An emergency situation, or  exigency,
is urgent and demands immediate action. Our lives are filled with exigencies, both large and small,
from a child stuck in a tree to lightning striking your house to catastrophic river flooding. Each
is an exigency Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; it's all a matter of perspective.
