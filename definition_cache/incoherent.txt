Incoherent thoughts don't follow each other logically. Incoherent speech is mumbled or jumbled.
Incoherent means that something is difficult to understand because it's not holding together.

A lot of people use incoherent to mean unintelligible, which is a perfectly fine usage. But it
specifically means unintelligible due to a lack of cohesion, or sticking together. An incoherent
argument may sound something like this. I deserve to go to the dance because it is the second
Tuesday of the month and my feet are a size ten. The reasons do not follow each other logically and
to not even relate. It's an incoherent mess.
