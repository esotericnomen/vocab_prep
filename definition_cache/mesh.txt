Use the word mesh for fabric made of loosely woven fibers. A butterfly net is made of mesh, and so
is a window screen.

Some mesh is made from string or fabric, like a fishing net or a mesh sports jersey, while other
mesh is metal or plastic, like a tea strainer. In either case, it's woven loosely enough that there
are small holes throughout its surface. Another meaning of mesh is harmonize or work well together.
In the fourteenth century, it was spelled mesche, and it meant open space in a net, from the Old
English word for net, max.
