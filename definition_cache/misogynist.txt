If you're someone who believes women belong in the kitchen and shouldn't be accorded the same
respect as men, you might be a misogynist. A misogynist is a person who hates or doesn't trust
women.

Misogynist is from Greek misogyná¸&mdash;s, from the prefix miso- hatred plus gyná¸&mdash; a
woman. The English suffix -ist means person who does something. The prefix mis-, a variant of miso-
before a vowel, appears in the opposite term misandrist, which is a person who hates or doesn't
trust men. The corresponding nouns are mysogyny and misandry.
