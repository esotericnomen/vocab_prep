Your father's loss of his job may militate against the big family vacation your parents had been
planning. To militate is to be a deciding factor for or against.

The word militate descends from the same Latin word as military. Imagine armed soldiers at a check
point. Their presence might militate against your plan of crossing the border, or it might militate
for their bringing you in for questioning. When you are young, sometimes your age works for you, and
sometimes it militates against you.
