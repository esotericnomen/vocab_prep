If two rival football teams played a close game that went into overtime, it could be could be said
that winning it was a titanic struggle. This means it took a large amount of force and power to do
so.

The root word titan is derived from Greek mythology. The Titans were a race of powerful deities. The
adjective titanic can now refer to anything extremely large or strong. The Titanic was the name of
the famous cruise ship that sank in 1912 after hitting an iceberg in the Atlantic Ocean. This name
was chosen not only because it was the largest passenger steamship of its time, but also because it
was touted as a strong ship, specifically that it was â&euro;&oelig;unsinkable.â&euro;?
