Use the noun, catharsis, to refer to the experience a person can have of releasing emotional tension
and feeling refreshed afterwards.

Conceived by Aristotle as the cleansing effect of emotional release that tragic drama has on its
audience, catharsis stems from a Greek verb meaning to purify, purge. Today, it can be used to
describe any emotional release, including a good long laugh or cry that is followed by a sense of
balance and freshness afterwards.
