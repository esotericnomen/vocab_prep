Something thin is narrow or not very thick. If you wear thin socks on a cold winter day, your toes
might start to feel numb.

Thin can describe something that is narrow and slender, like a hair or a thread. It can also
describe a layer of something that is not very thick, such as paper. To thin something out is to
make it lesser or weaker, like thinning out a sauce by adding water. You can also use this word
figuratively. An argument that is not very convincing is thin.
