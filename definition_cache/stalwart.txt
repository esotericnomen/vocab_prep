To be stalwart is to be loyal, no matter what, like your friend who remains a devoted fan of an
actor she's admired since childhood, even if that was the last time the guy made a decent movie.

Stalwart can describe someone who's able to keep on going even when things get hard, like a marathon
runner who doesn't slow down, even after spraining an ankle, or a supporter of a political cause
that everyone else has long declared over. In U.S. history, the word stalwart was used in 1877 to
describe Republicans who remained unwilling to trust the South, even though the Civil War was long
over by that time.
