A taxonomist is a biologist that groups organisms into categories.  A plant taxonomist for example,
might study the origins and relationships between different types of roses while an insect
taxonomist might focus on the relationships between different types of beetles.

A taxonomist is not to be confused with a taxidermist, a person who specializes in the stuffing and
mounting of dead animals. It's true, both words share their origins in the Greek taxis meaning
arrangement.  But in the case of a taxonomist, it's not dead animals that are being arranged, its
hierarchies of species.
