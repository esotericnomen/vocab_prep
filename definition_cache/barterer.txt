A barterer is a person who trades goods for other goods, instead of using money. You are a barterer
if you trade your scooter for a skateboard.

The word barterer most likely comes from the Old French word barater, which means to deceive. So
barterers were probably thought to be untrustworthy in trade. Nowadays, though, a barterer is just
someone who engages in trade without using money. This might be by choice or because of the
tradition of a country or culture.
