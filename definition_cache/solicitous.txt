When you hear the word solicitous, think of your mom — attentive, caring and concerned. It's nice
when your waiter gives you good service, but if he or she is solicitous, the hovering might annoy
you.

Solicitous comes from the Latin roots sollus entire and citus set in motion. If someone is
solicitous, they are entirely set in motion caring for you. Your neighbors are solicitous if they
try to help your family out all the time. Use this word too if you're eager to do something. A good
student will be solicitous to appear interested in what the teacher says — even when it's not that
interesting.
