When the bad-tempered Queen of Hearts cried “off with their heads!” in Alice in Wonderland, she
was ordering her henchmen to decapitate those who had offended her.

The verb decapitate comes from Latin de ”away” or “down” and caput “head.” Don’t
confuse it with kaput, a German word that means “broken” or destroyed.” Of course, if someone
were to decapitate you, you’d be pretty well kaput.
