When two warring sides decide to call it quits, it's called a truce â€” an agreement to end the
fighting.

When there's a truce, the two sides stop attacking each other, catch their breath, and try to work
out a peace deal. A truce isn't a permanent solution: it's more like a time-out. People with other
kinds of conflicts talk about truces, too. If you and your sister are in an ongoing battle, one of
you could say, Can we please call a truce? That means you'll take a break from squabbling, at least
for a while.
