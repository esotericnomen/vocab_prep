Not straying far from its Latin root terra meaning earth, terrestrial means of the earth. If it's
terrestrial, you'll find it on earth. If it's extraterrestrial, you'll find it emerging from a UFO.

The adjective terrestrial can also be used to describe something that lives on land (as opposed to
living in water, for example). On their trip to the rain forest, the scientists were charged with
cataloging terrestrial animals. Another group was going to be in charge of cataloging the aquatic
animals. The adjective can also be used to describe something that is mundane in character. The
teenager cried, My life is boring and full of terrestrial events like going to band practice and to
class!
