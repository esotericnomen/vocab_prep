You know that wharf on the bank of the river where all the boats park? It's not an aqua parking lot.
It's called a quay.

Don't be fooled by the qu at the beginning of quay Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; there's no w sound to be found.
It's actually pronounced kay. That's most likely because it comes to us from the Old French word
cai, and that's how the French pronounce their qu words. So sit back, make a hard k sound and
imagine yourself strolling along the quays of the Seine.
