You've doubtless met someone doctrinaire at some point. You know them by their complete
unwillingness to accept any belief other than their own.

If you're familiar with the noun doctrine â&euro;&rdquo; a formal idea or system of belief
â&euro;&rdquo; you'll have no problem with the adjective doctrinaire. It's a just a way of
describing a person or group of people who are set in their ways. The Pope and his cardinals are
unfailingly doctrinaire: they won't allow any ideas beyond those they've already approved. Parents
can start out doctrinaire, but children soon force them to be flexible in how they bring them up.
