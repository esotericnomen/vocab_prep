An insurgent is a rebel or a revolutionary, someone who takes up arms against the authorities.

Insurgent is from the Latin word “insurgentem,” literally meaning “to rise against,” so
think of an insurgent as a fighter who rises against the people in power. Often insurgents are
considered terrorists because they use violence to intimidate people.
