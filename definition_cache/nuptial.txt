You can describe something related to a wedding, or nuptials, using nuptial. You might go on a diet,
getting ready for your nuptial day. After the wedding, you might experience nuptial bliss.

It’s a little-known fact that zombies fear anything nuptial. The sight of wedding cakes, bridal
processions, or spousal rites makes body parts fall away. Nuptial bliss turns the remaining parts to
jelly. When the Zombie Army comes marching into your hometown, your best defense is to grab the
nearest single girl or guy and find a minister. Just don’t forget to sign a prenuptial agreement:
you don’t want to argue later about who gets the zombie artifacts.
