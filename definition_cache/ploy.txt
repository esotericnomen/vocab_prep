A ploy is a clever plan that helps you get what you want. A manipulative little girl might shed
tears simply as a ploy to get her mother to buy her ice cream.

A politician might add amendments to a bill as a ploy to delay voting, or a hooligan might yell,
Fire! in a movie theater as a ploy to sneak his friends in. A sneaky move in a game is a ploy, and
sensational news about a celebrity can be just a ploy to get him more media attention. The first
recorded use of ploy was in 1722, meaning anything with which one amuses oneself in Scottish and
Northern English dialects.
