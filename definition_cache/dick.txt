Dick is a vulgar slang word for a penis. It's also an insulting thing to call someone you don't
like, especially a boy or man.

Much like ass, this word for a below-the-belt body part is very commonly used as an insult meaning
pretty much jerk or idiot. Only males have dicks, and this insult is usually used toward a guy who
is acting like a dick.  Lots of people find this word offensive, especially parents, teachers, and
other adults. If you have to discuss a dick, you're better off saying penis or using a slang word
that's sillier and less offensive, like johnson.
