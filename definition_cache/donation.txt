A donation is a gift someone gives to a cause they believe in. If you have ever put a dollar into a
collection plate or hat, you have made a donation.

No one has to give a donation; donations are voluntary. In addition to disease research, many
schools, arts groups, museums, churches, and groups that help the poor rely on donations. Donations
usually take the form of  money, but giving anything away to a cause could be considered a donation
Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; like giving books to a library or bringing deviled eggs to a school potluck.
