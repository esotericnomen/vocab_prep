When you prance, you swagger around with exaggerated, proud movements. If you've seen many rock
concerts, you've seen people prance around onstage.

When people prance, they're showing off, strutting for the benefit of their audience. Horses prance
too, with a gait that's also a little artificial, using high, springy steps. You might prance a
little when you run up on stage to accept an award, and a show horse might be equally inclined to
prance as it moves past the judges. The horse gait definition is the original meaning of prance, and
it probably comes from the Middle English pranken, to show off.
