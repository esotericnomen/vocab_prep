Ever snore at the opera? Burp at the dinner table? Forget your mom's birthday? Probably all three,
right? Well, don't worry. Instead of just screwing up, what you did was commit a solecism. Sounds
kinda neat that way, huh?

The origin of solecism comes from the ancient Greek word meaning speaking incorrectly, and solecism
does have another meaning that's more specifically verbal. If you say something incorrectly, or make
a grammatical error in writing, that's also a solecism. It can be just as mortifying as burping at
the dinner table. Well, almost.
