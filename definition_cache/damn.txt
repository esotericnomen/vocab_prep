Damn is a common, somewhat naughty exclamation. In one sense it means to condemn or send someone to
hell, as in God damn it! Other times it means a little amount, as in I don't give a damn about
baseball.

People can give a damn, damn others to hell, and complain about the damn weather. Some religious
people believe their sins could damn them to an eternity of torment and hellfire. You should be
careful when peppering your speech with damn, as it might offend some ears. But sometimes damn can
be used positively, as in They make the best damn pizza in town!
