Spooky, sneaky, powerful and strange, necromancy is the art of raising the spirits of the dead,
either for their predictions about the future, or their ghostly help in making something happen.

Necromancy, also called black magic, comes from the ancient Greek word for corpse necro and prophecy
mancy. If you travel to the underworld to speak to the dead, then you have the power of necromancy,
not to mention geomancy, the ability to read signs from the earth to find the necropolis, or city of
the dead. As you might guess, necromancy isnâ&euro;&trade;t discussed much these days. But if
youâ&euro;&trade;re reading about old witch trials, you might find accusations of necromancy
abound.
