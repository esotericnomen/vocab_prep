We are sorry to inform you that the adjective contrite means to feel regret, remorse, or even guilt.

Someone who feels remorse or guilt is contrite and in addition to feeling sorry, part of the
definition includes wanting to atone for a having done something wrong. The word comes from the
Latin roots com- meaning together and terere which means to rub. It's also related to the Latin word
conterere and is defined as to bruise. In the field of theology being contrite is being remorseful
for past sin and resolved to avoid future sin.
