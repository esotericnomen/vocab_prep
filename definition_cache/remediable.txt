If it's remediable than it can be fixed or cured. Your dog's bad breath, dangerous shopping habits,
and poison ivy are all remediable afflictions.

Remediable is a formal way of describing something that can be fixed up because there's a remedy for
it. Horace Mann, the first American advocate of public education, said that “evil is inevitable,
but is also remediable” — meaning that even the most rotten kids can be reformed and rehabbed
into model citizens. Today's detention hall monitors might disagree.
