Viscous means sticky, gluey and syrupy. So if something is viscous, you usually don't want to stick
your fingers in it â€” that goes for boogers and maple syrup alike.

Not quite a solid and not quite a liquid, scientists like to say that viscous things don't flow very
easily. They glop and slug around slowly, sticking to whatever they come in contact with. Think of
making a batch of Rice Krispie treats: One minute the marshmallows are solid little rounds; the next
minute they're melted into a web of sticky white goo that's somehow attached itself to the Rice
Krispies, the spoon, the countertops, your nose, the front door, and the dog.
