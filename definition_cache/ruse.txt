Movie bank robbers always seem to pull some kind of ruse, a deceptive trick or tactic like hiding
the money underneath the bank while they drive off in the getaway car to avoid capture by the
police.

You'd use a ruse if you were up to something sneaky and were trying to get away with it without
being discovered. The wife planning a surprise birthday party for her husband could send him out to
the supermarket as a ruse, a trick so she could sneak one hundred of his closest friends into the
house without him noticing.
