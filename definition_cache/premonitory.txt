Use the adjective premonitory to describe something that predicts something bad will happen, like a
premonitory sneezing fit that comes before you come down with an awful cold.

The adjective premonitory is related to the Latin word praemonere, from prae, meaning “before,”
and monere, meaning “warn.” The dark premonitory clouds that roll in before a storm can ruin
your day at the beach, or the premonitory feeling that a new friend isn't trustworthy are warnings
to pack up and get out before something disastrous happens.
