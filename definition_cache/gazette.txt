A newspaper or journal can be called a gazette. In fact, many English-language newspapers from
coast-to-coast include the name gazette in their title, from The Daily Hampshire Gazette in
Massachusetts to the Mariposa Gazette in California.

The noun gazette comes from the Italian word gazzetta. In the 1600s, there was a Venetian news sheet
that became known as a gazeta because it cost a gazeta, a small-valued Venetian coin. Other experts
suggest that the word comes from gazza, a kind of bird â&euro;&rdquo; specifically a chattering
magpie â&euro;&rdquo; that would spread news. A related word is gazetteer, which is a dictionary of
geographical names.
