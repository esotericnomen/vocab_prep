A warrior during the Middle Ages most often carried a lance, or a long, pointed spear, as a weapon.

Throughout history, soldiers mounted on horseback have often carried some variation of a lance
Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; something long and sharp for jabbing at enemy warriors. Lances were carried as far
back as ancient Roman armies and as recently as Plains Indians after they were introduced to horses
in the eighteenth century. The Latin root word, lancea , means light spear or Spanish spear.
