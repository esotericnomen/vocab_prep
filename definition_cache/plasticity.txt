Plasticity means changeability or moldability â€” clay has a lot of plasticity, but a rock has
almost none.

It helps to think of plastic when learning what plasticity means. See how plastic can be molded into
all sorts of things, and even when it's in a totally solid form, it's not hard like stone?
Plasticity refers to things that can still change their shape or function. The brain is something
with high plasticity: if you have a brain injury, other parts of the brain can change to pick up the
slack. Anything that is capable of evolving or being reshaped has plasticity.
