A vagabond is someone who moves around a lot. Picture Boxcar Willie, bandana on a stick thrown over
his shoulder, going wherever the breeze takes him.

Vagabond can also be an adjective, a nomadic tribe is a vagabond one, or the person who moved eight
times in two years is living a vagabond life. It's from the Latin word vagabundus (from vagari,
wander) which means inclined to wander. So Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; if you were born a ramblin' man, you
might just be a vagabond.
