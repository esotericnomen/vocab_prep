It would be nice to transcend the narrow limits of this brief definition, and go to greater lengths
to describe this word's glories! Transcend means to move upward and beyond something.

No doubt you know about the words transcontinental or maybe trans fats? The prefix trans is used to
mean beyond, across and transcend takes this even farther by adding in a sense of upwardness with
the stem cend. A pop artist with a lot of talent might transcend the genre of pop. You can't assume
a person's opinion on national security by party affiliation Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; it often transcends
party lines.
