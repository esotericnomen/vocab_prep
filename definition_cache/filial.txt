If you describe something as filial, you're saying it's offspring-related.  Depending on who your
parents are, your filial duties might include taking out the trash, or washing dishes, or ruling
empires.

The word filial comes from the Latin words filius, which means son, and filia, or daughter. In other
words, filial is the filius of filius. One way of remembering the word is to the think of a filly, a
young horse.  The two words aren't related, but it's fun to put them in the same sentence: The
filly's filial love made the mare a happy mom.
