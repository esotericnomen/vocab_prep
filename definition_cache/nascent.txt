Nascent describes the birth or beginning of something, for example a civilization, a trend, an idea,
or an action.  It can also imply a future promise, like the nascent government of a new country.

You’re in the future looking back at the first time you learned the definition of the word
nascent.  Your nascent efforts to use the word felt awkward, but you quickly felt comfortable with
it, especially after you learned how to pronounce it: “NAY-sent.”  Now you use the word all the
time: the nascent hopes of your little sister; your nascent hula hooping gang; and a nascent
confidence in your vocabulary.
