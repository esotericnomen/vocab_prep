To imbue is to fill up with or become soaked in an idea or emotion, as a sponge takes in water. One
visit to Africa might be enough to imbue ambitions in a medical student to return to heal the sick.

You can use imbue in a similar way as saturate, or soak through, to describe a filling or absorbing.
A hue is a color, and it rhymes with imbue. When you're imbued with something, you are, in a way,
colored by it. If you imbue a dish sponge with oily orange water from a spaghetti bowl, the color
and the oil soak in. To fill people with qualities or emotions is, for example, to imbue them with
strength or optimism.
