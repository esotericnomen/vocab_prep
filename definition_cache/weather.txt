Weather is the atmospheric conditions, including the temperature, wind, snow, rain, or anything else
happening outside. People tend to talk about the weather when they can't think of anything else to
talk about.

In some places, people say, Don't like the weather? Wait an hour and it'll change. Every day,
experts try to predict the weather, but they never get it exactly right. You can also use weather to
mean endure something, as in I weathered the storm at work. That's not a real storm, but a stormy
situation. Even though the weather drives us all crazy at times, at least it gives us something to
blab about.
