If you are enterprising, you are creative and show initiative. Were you the kid who bought candy
before school and sold it during school at a profit? If so, you were an enterprising little one.

Though it has the word, enterprise, in it and is often used to describe people who set up businesses
to fill a need, enterprising can be used for any kind of display of creative initiative. Kids who
decide on their own to build a skate park are enterprising, as is a dance company that is able to
perform a piece on a shoestring budget.
