Use the adjective tensile to describe materials that can be shaped, such as the tensile clay that a
potter crafts into a bowl or vase.

Tensile rhymes with pencil. It might remind you of the word tense, and in fact, tensile can also
mean having to do with tension. Think about a tensile material, like wire. It will stretch and
stretch until it reaches its limit. Drawn tight, with no slack, the wire has tensile stress.
