If something is limp, loose, droopy, and wrinkly, you can call it flaccid, which rhymes with acid.
Think elephant skin, soggy asparagus, and the type of feeble handshakes frowned on in job
interviews.

We get the word flaccid from the Latin flaccus, which meant flabby. The meaning is pretty much the
same today, though it applies to  more than physical flab. Flaccid pops up in conversation to
describe lackluster leadership, dull conversation, and even feeble attempts at word definitions. If
a politician's election campaign is flaccid, it will surprise no one that he only receives two votes
Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; one from his grandmother and the other from someone who accidentally checked the
wrong box on the ballot.
