The French word ennui describes a feeling that combines tiredness and boredom. Ennui is one version
of the blahs.

Though it sounds it little fancy â&euro;&rdquo; maybe because it comes from French â&euro;&rdquo;
ennui is a common feeling that everybody experiences: being bored and tired. School and work fill
lots of people with ennui. A terrible TV show could create ennui. If you feel like your life is
going nowhere, ennui could set in. When you're feeling ennui, you might as well take a nap, because
you're too drowsy and uninterested to do much of anything else.
