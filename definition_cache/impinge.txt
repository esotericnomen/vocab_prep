Whether you have a habit of standing too close when talking to others or bringing luggage on a
crowded rush-hour subway car, you'll find people don't like it when you impinge on their personal
space.

When you impinge, you intrude on something, whether it’s someone else’s space, time, or rights.
Think of it as moving in on someone’s territory. The word also can be used in the sense of
affecting something, usually negatively, often by restricting it. For example, constantly inviting
your friend to go shopping and meet you in nice restaurants might impinge on her desire to save
money.
