To waver is to move back and forth, like when you waver, one minute thinking you'll stay home,
planning to go meet your friends the next, until you finally make your decision.

Waver comes from the Old English word wæfre, which means “restless.” When the wind blows, it
makes the leaves and flowers waver, or move, in that same direction. A person who wavers is much the
same — affected by any influence or change. He or she isn't sure what to do or may be too shy to
express a preference until time is just about up and a decision must be made.
