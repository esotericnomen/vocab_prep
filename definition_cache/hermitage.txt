Your summer cabin deep in the woods where you go to think about how funny life is sometimes? If you
want to sound fancy, it could be called a hermitage, a dwelling removed from civilization.

The noun hermitage has origins in the French word hermite, meaning “hermit,” a person who lives
alone, far from society. Hermitage can describe the place where a hermit lives, or a dwelling
occupied by an isolated religious group that prefers solitude. But the word is likely to be used
more broadly to describe a secluded or remote dwelling, a place of solitude, where you won’t run
into a neighbor while mowing the lawn in the backyard.
