Sherbet is a frozen dessert made of fruit juice and sugar. Though it looks like ice cream, sherbet
is a little different since it's made with little or no milk or cream.

Since sherbet is typically made with fruit, it often comes in shockingly bright colors like pink,
orange, or green and has a refreshing taste. This delicious summer treat has been around a long
time, in some form at least Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; the word sherbet came into English in the 17th century
from the Turkish word zerbet, meaning drink made from diluted fruit juice and sugar. Make sure you
don't add an extra r in sherbet: the ending is spelled bet.
