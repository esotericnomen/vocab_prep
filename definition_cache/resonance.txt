If you have a loud, deep voice, then your voice has resonance, and if your words are powerful and
meaningful, then your words have resonance, too. Something with resonance has a deep tone or a
powerful lasting effect.

Resonance is the quality of being “resonant,” which can mean “strong and deep in tone” or
“having a lasting effect.” If your voice has resonance, you might consider a profession that
involves public speaking. Perhaps you'll become a politician and deliver speeches that have a
lasting effect, or resonance, with your audience. Rooms that intensify sound, like many gymnasiums,
can also be said to have resonance.
