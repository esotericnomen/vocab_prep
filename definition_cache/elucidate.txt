If you elucidate something, you explain it very clearly. If you don't understand fractions, a visit
to the pie shop may elucidate the subject for you.

Elucidate is from Late Latin elucidare, from the Latin prefix e- thoroughly plus  lucidus clear,
bright. This Latin adjective is the source of English lucid, which describes someone who thinks
clearly or something that is clear enough to understand.
