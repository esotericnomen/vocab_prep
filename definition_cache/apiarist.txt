An apiarist is a fancy word for a beekeeper.

An apiarist enjoys working with an unusual kind of pet, the honeybee.  Because bees and other
pollinators are so important to a healthy environment scientists encourage “bee-spotting” to
improve fruits and vegetables.  The -ist suffix is a Greek form that means “a person connected
with.”  So, a good apiarist is probably a strong environmentalist.
