When you squelch something, you're putting an end to it. You can squelch an idea or a rebellion.

This word has several meanings, but it's usually a verb for crushing things. A mean remark could
squelch your self-confidence, and a powerful military could squelch an invading country. Squelching
can also mean to make a squelch-like sucking sound Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; or to slop, slosh, splash, and
squish through the mud. There's also a type of electric circuit that cuts off when the signal is
weak: that's a squelch circuit, which squelches the connection.
