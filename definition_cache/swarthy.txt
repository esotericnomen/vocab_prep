Swarthy means dark skinned. If you like tall, dark and handsome men, you find a swarthy complexion
attractive.

Not everyone with dark skin is swarthy. The word is usually used to describe someone whose skin is
weather beaten and darkened by the sun, or has an olive complexion. But, the famous 19th century
American poet Walt Whitman, who was of English and Dutch stock, seemed to be describing himself in
his poem Behold This Swarthy Face, so swarthy may be in the eyes of the beholder.
