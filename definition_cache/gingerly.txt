If something needs to be done with great care and caution, you should do it gingerly. Like gingerly
holding a newborn baby or gingerly creeping down the creaky stairs when you're trying to sneak out.

Before it came to mean “extremely cautiously” in 1600, gingerly meant “elegantly, daintily.”
In fact, it stems from the Latin word gentius, meaning “(well)-born.” But today it has less to
do with elegance and more to do with a delicate touch, usually used to avoid hurting something or
someone. For example, you might want to gingerly hug your friend with the broken rib to avoid making
her wince in pain.
