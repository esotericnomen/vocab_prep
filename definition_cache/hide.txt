You can hide your feelings or you can hide your mom’s birthday present. You can even hide yourself
if you need to avoid someone. Whatever it is, when you hide something, you put it out of sight.

Hide can mean that you keep something secret, like the way you really feel about your dad’s
meatloaf. You can also hide something physical. If you spill juice on your white sofa, you can hide
the stain with a pillow. Sometimes people hide also — that means the person stays out of sight. A
bankrobber will hide from the police, or you might hide from your mom to avoid doing the dishes.
