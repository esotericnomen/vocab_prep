Bikes on which you recline rather than sit upright are recumbent. Recumbent means to leaning back in
a reclining position.

Recumbent starts like recline, which is an easy way to remember it. Your dad's position in his
favorite La-Z-Boy reclining chair? Recumbent. Your position when you lay back on lounge chair at the
pool? Also recumbent Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; and in both cases, these are both positions of comfort.
