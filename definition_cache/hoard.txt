To hoard is to save something (or lots of things) for future use. Squirrels hoard nuts for the
winter. Old ladies tend to hoard canned food and used plastic bags.

People have been using the word hoard for both to hide and treasure for centuries; as both a verb
and as a noun. Some hoard valuables, such as money, jewelry, and family antiques. Others build up a
hoard, or cache, of things that aren't worth money but are important to them Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; like
comic books or match books.
