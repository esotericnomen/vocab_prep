A layman might have a small amount of knowledge about something, but she isn't officially trained in
the subject. If you need brain surgery, don't consult a layman; stick to a professional brain
surgeon.

Use the noun layman to describe your brother, who is an amateur bird watcher rather than a
professional ornithologist. The word layman is most often used to contrast with expert or
professional. Another way to use it is to distinguish between a member of the clergy â&euro;&rdquo;
a priest or minister, for example â&euro;&rdquo; and an ordinary church member, or layman.
