Use the noun martinet to describe someone is a stickler when it comes to following rules, such as
the teacher who won't accept homework if it is written in a color other than blue.

Pronounce martinet with the accent on the last syllable: mar-ti-NET. Jean Martinet, the man for whom
the word was coined, would insist you say his name correctly. He was a legendary drillmaster for the
French army during the reign of Louis XIV. In 1779, a hundred years after Martinet's death, martinet
came to mean any officer who was as strict and demanding in adhering to the rules as Martinet
himself.
