An ecologist is a scientist who studies how animals and plants interact with their environment.  If
you spend hours watching television shows about animals, maybe you’ve got an ecologist inside you
trying to get out.

To be an ecologist, first you have to learn about ecology — the study of organisms and how they
relate to their environment. Ecology is a word that comes from the Greek oikos, meaning “house.”
Basically, ecologists study the environment like it’s a big house, and all the living creatures in
it are roommates.  Sounds like a lot of work, and it is.
