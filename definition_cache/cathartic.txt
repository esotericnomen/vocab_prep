A movie, play, or song that makes you cry is called cathartic. Most good writers try to create work
that causes you to experience a strong rush of emotion.

If you've been feeling like you need a good cry, you should watch a cathartic movie like Bambi
â&euro;&rdquo; or any film that's sure to make you weep. Things that are cathartic don't always
call up tears. Things that makes you scream, like a roller-coaster ride or a boxing match, are also
cathartic. Whatever causes you to release a sudden flood of feelings is cathartic. Some therapies
ask you to hit a pillow or break dishes, because those are cathartic activities.
