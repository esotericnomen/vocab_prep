A glimmer is a tiny glint of light or the sliver of an idea. Either way, it's a sign of a lot more
going on behind the scenes.

A glimmer of light is just a little bit of light, maybe sneaking through the curtains enough to make
a flicker on the floor. A glimmer of an idea is just a small inkling of an idea. When someone
doesn't understand something, you could make them feel worse by saying, You don't have a glimmer of
what I'm talking about, do you? When it comes to light, you can also say light is glimmering, or
gleaming. People often say stars are glimmering.
