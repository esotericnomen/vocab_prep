The noun gravity means being grave or very serious. In physics, gravity is the natural force that
causes things to fall toward the earth.

Someone who conducts themselves with an air of gravity is someone who takes what they are doing
seriously. You might be amused to see a three year old serving her dolls tea with an air of gravity
appropriate to the Queen of England. Gravity was borrowed through French from Latin gravitﾄ《,
from gravis heavy.
