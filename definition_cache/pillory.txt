A pillory is a wooden frame with cutouts for someone's head and hands. Long ago, people found guilty
of a crime could be sentenced to be locked in a pillory for a certain amount of time for punishment
but also for public humiliation.

The verb pillory means to be punished by being locked in a pillory, but references to this form of
punishment are historic and it is no longer used Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; you might see references today to
someone in a pillory in a cartoon. As a modern verb, pillory means both to criticize harshly and to
expose to public ridicule. Someone who is caught doing something immoral may be pilloried and people
who believe they have been unfairly criticized say they have been pilloried, but often only after
they've been exposed!
