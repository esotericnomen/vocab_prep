Anything that brings about a strong reaction can be said to provoke. You can provoke that lion if
you want. But if he responds by attacking, don't come running to me.

Let's consider some people who have been known to provoke. Lenny Bruce, was more than just a
comedian. He was a provocateur who used humor to deliver his controversial diatribes. Humor was his
way to provoke people to think. Madonna made her name not only by producing a memorable catalogue of
great pop songs, she proved herself to be a master at provoking people through her outrageous attire
and lyrics. The moral of this story? It's possible to provoke both positive and negative responses.
