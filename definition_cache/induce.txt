To induce is to move or lead someone to action. A promise of a lollipop can induce a toddler to do
just about anything, even sit down and be polite to Aunt Edna. Older kids need something more
substantial.

Some people believe that if you offer someone a large enough sum of money, you could induce them to
do almost anything. But a movie heroine might say to the villain, Nothing could induce me to marry
you. Not all the money in the world. Not if you were the last man on Earth! Induce also means to
stimulate the occurrence of something, such as medications used to induce vomiting, or to induce a
pregnant woman to go into labor.
