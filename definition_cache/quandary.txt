How to define the word quandary? Wow, this is quite a dilemma. What to do, what to do? Hmmm. Looks
like this moment itself is a quandary: a tough situation that will be really hard to resolve.

If you’re uncertain what to do because all of your options seem unpleasant, you’re probably in a
quandary. Some voters find themselves in a quandary when they dislike all of the candidates. A more
common quandary is when you plan two events at the same time and can’t decide which one to attend.
Some synonyms are predicament, dilemma, plight, and pickle — and choosing which word to use is a
quandary in itself.
