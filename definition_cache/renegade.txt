A renegade is a person who has deserted their cause or defied convention; they're rebels and
sometimes outlaws, or even traitors.

A long, long time ago, a renegade was a Christian person who decided to become Muslim. That
definition is pretty outdated, as these days a renegade is anyone who breaks laws or expectations to
do their own thing or join the other side. It might sound kind of cool to be a renegade, like some
rogue action hero. But in general, renegade actions are frowned, not smiled, upon.
