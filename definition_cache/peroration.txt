If you attend a political convention, be prepared to hear a peroration â€” a long, lofty speech. If
the speech really drags on, you might find yourself hoping for its peroration, as peroration can
also refer to a speech's conclusion.

Peroration comes from the Latin root orare, meaning to speak. This ancestry places peroration in the
same word family as oration, meaning a formal speech, and perorate, meaning to speak at length. A
peroration is usually a step above your run-of-the-mill speech, or even a typical oration, as it
involves an extended spoken spectacle filled with elaborate and persuasive language.
