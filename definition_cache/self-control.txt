Self-control is the quality that allows you to stop yourself from doing things you want to do but
that might not be in your best interest. For example, without self-control, you might burp and curse
nonstop.

Have you ever had a potato chip or two and pretty soon you√¢&euro;&trade;ve eaten the whole bag?
Eating a whole bag of chips shows little self-control. Not charging an expensive thing you want to a
credit card takes self-control. Getting up early for work takes self-control. Without self-control,
it's hard to get far in life. Self-control is similar to self-discipline.
