It's possible to perpetrate a good deed, but not likely. That's because perpetrate means to commit
or be responsible for something â€” usually something mischievous or bad.

If you manage to slip a whoopee cushion under your teacher's rear without her seeing it, then you've
perpetrated a classic prank. But if you use your wily ways to break into the bank's safe, then
you've just turned yourself into a felony-class perpetrator. So do yourself a favor and stick to
perpetrating lesser crimes.
