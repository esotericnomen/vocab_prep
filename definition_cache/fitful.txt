An adjective that sounds a little like what it means, fitful means stopping and starting, on-again
off-again, switching suddenly. I had a fitful night's sleep: I woke up several times throughout the
night.

A fit is a disturbance that happens without warning, like a tantrum, tremor, or spasm. If something
is fitful, it's full of fits. A night at the opera is a night of fitful pleasures: the arias are
cool, but the rest of the show is boring. I've made only fitful progress trying to lose weight,
because I lose only a few pounds at a time, and they almost always come right back:  my progress is
fitful because it comes in fits and starts.
