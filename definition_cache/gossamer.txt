Gossamer is something super fine and delicate â€” like a spider web or the material of a wedding
veil.

The original gossamer, from which these meanings come from, is the fine, filmy substance spiders
excrete to weave their webs. A dress can be gossamer-like, if its fabric is so sheer as to be see-
through, or almost. Your chances of going to a good college are gossamer thin if you've never
cracked a book in high school.
