If you make the winning bid on an item, you offer the highest price and get to take it home.
Congratulations, and enjoy your new paper weight!

Bid comes from an Old English word meaning â&euro;&oelig;to offer,â&euro;? which is right in line
with its meaning today. To bid is the act of offering a bid, or more generally to try to get
something. With several companies bidding for your services, you have a lot to consider. Tip: go
where the weather's warmest.
