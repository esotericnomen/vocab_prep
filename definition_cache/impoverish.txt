To impoverish is to take away a person's livelihood. When a drought ruins a farmer's crop and he has
nothing to harvest, his bad luck may leave him and his family impoverished, or poor.

The Latin prefix in- is changed to im when in front of a word starting with the letter p-, but its
meaning in or into stays the same. With roots in the French word povre meaning poor, impoverish
means to make poor or drive someone into poverty. The 2010 earthquake in Haiti left over a million
people impoverished, destroying everything they owned.
