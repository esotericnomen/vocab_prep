When you slog, you toil at something, working hard and often slowly to get a difficult job done. You
might slog with your shovel through the pile of snow in your driveway.

A worker might slog through a pile of papers on her desk, or slog long and hard on a construction
crew. In either case, the job requires persistence and determination. Another way to slog is to walk
with difficulty, the way someone might slog along a muddy road to the gas station after getting a
flat tire. The original meaning of slog was hit hard, possibly as a variation of slug.
