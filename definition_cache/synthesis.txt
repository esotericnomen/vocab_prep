Synthesis is the act of combining elements to form something new. If you describe your bedroom decor
as a synthesis of Andy Warhol and Punk Rock, we'll know you mean a mixture of these two styles.

Synthesis is just as comfortable in the concrete realm as it is in the abstract. Scientists use it
to talk about what happens when chemicals combine Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; think of photosynthesis: the
process by which plants synthesize light, carbon dioxide, and water to produce food. If you call a
movie Batman meets Titanic, then that's synthesis as well. Political science students can remember
synthesis via the famous thesis-antithesis-synthesis concept that suggests societies change when a
widely accepted idea (a thesis) is challenged by a new, contradictory idea (an antithesis), and then
resolved via synthesis, or a combining of the two to produce something new.
