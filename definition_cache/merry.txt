To be merry is to be happy, especially in a fun, festive way. Parties and celebrations are merry,
and so are the fun people who attend them. This old fashioned word for “happy” is popular in
December when people say, “Merry Christmas.”

To be merry is to be happy, jaunty, and ready to frolic. A group of people laughing as they walk
down the street is a merry gang. Anything merry is festive, often involving games, celebrations, and
parties. A merry-go-round makes kids happy as it spins them around. Smiling and laughing are signs
of being merry. If you go along your merry way, you walk away happily, maybe even skipping.
