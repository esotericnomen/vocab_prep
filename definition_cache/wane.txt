Things that wax and wane grow larger and smaller, like the moon. Things that wane simply grow
smaller. My initial enthusiasm for helping waned when I saw the pile of envelopes that needed
licking.

You may have heard the expression on the wane. It means a fad, or a fashion, or a disease, that is
on its way out the door. The face mask fad at school was on the wane as new reports of kids infected
with a dreaded new fly virus waned.
