Cogitate is a fancy was of saying think hard on. If you spend a lot of time figuring out exactly how
your French teacher does her hair, you are cogitating in order to avoid conjugating.

Cogitate can be used both transitively or intransitively, which means you can cogitate on something,
like your history project or your why your computer never seems to work the way you want it to. Or
you can simply sit in your room and cogitate.
