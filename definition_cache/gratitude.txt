Gratitude means thanks and appreciation. It's the warm feeling you get when you remember the person
who told you to drop your 1980s hairstyle and get with the new millennium already.

Though they both recognize the instrumental roles others have played in our lives, gratitude is
different from indebtedness. Gratitude, which rhymes with attitude, comes from the Latin word
gratus, which means thankful, pleasing. When you feel gratitude, you're pleased by what someone did
for you and also pleased by the results. Unlike indebtedness, you're not anxious about having to pay
it back. But it's still great to tell the recipient of your gratitude how much they mean to you.
