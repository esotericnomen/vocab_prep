Kinship is a family relationship. You might describe the wonderful, close kinship you have with your
favorite cousin.

Your kin is your family, so it's easy to see that kinship describes family bonds, like the kinship
between members of the same Scottish clan or the kinship an uncle feels in the midst of a dozen
crazy nieces and nephews. Kinship can also describe a close family-like relationship, like the
kinship of the teachers at your school who have worked together for many years and who all care
deeply about students and learning.
