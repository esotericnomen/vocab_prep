A wont is a custom or habit, like my wont to drink at least ten cups of coffee a day. (In this
particular example, some people might call my wont an addiction.)

Wont is a tricky word, in terms of pronunciation; some people argue it sounds like want, while
others insist it's pronounced like won't. Perhaps the confusion over pronunciation explains why this
word is used relatively infrequently in everyday speech. It's most people's wont to use a synonym
like custom or habit.
