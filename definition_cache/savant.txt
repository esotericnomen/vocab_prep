You know that girl in your school with a GPA over 100? She is a savant in the making. A savant is
someone over-the-top smart, a scholar. It might take a savant only five minutes to do an entire math
test.

Savant is the French word for learned  and it goes back to the Latin word to be wise, sapere. There
are savants who are wise and learned, and then there are idiot savants, who are brilliant in very
specific areas, but not in others, like an idiot savant who knows absolutely everything about the
American Civil War but has no ability with learning a foreign language.
