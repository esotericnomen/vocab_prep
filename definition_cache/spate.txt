A spate is a large number. If a spate of new coffee shops open in your neighborhood, it’ll be easy
for you to stay wide awake.  You’ll have easy access to plenty of caffeine.

Though it’s now used to describe a large number or unusually large amount of something, the word
spate originally described a sudden flood of water, such as a river overflowing after a downpour.
Thinking about being overwhelmed by a sudden rush of water will help you remember to use spate when
you encounter an unexpected overflow of anything, whether it’s books, robberies, celebrity break-
ups, or corporate mergers.
