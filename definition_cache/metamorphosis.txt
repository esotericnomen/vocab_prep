In Kafka's novel entitled Metamorphosis, a man wakes up to find he has turned into a cockroach. That
kind of complete and startling change pretty much sums up the word.

When a caterpillar becomes a butterfly, it goes through a metamorphosis. An idea can undergo
metamorphosis, or metamorphosize, too as can feelings. After you spend a full summer with your
grandmother, your feelings about the woman may undergo a complete metamorphosis. While you were once
afraid of the old woman, you now love her dearly.
