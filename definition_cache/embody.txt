To embody a role is to fill it completely. If a high schooler seems to embody the character of
Macbeth, his performance might make the audience forget they're watching a dorky 15-year-old with
braces.

If you embody someone, you put him or her in-body, as when an actor gives a complete and compelling
representation of a character. You can also use embody to describe character traits you see in a
person, like, “He embodies truth,” or, “She is the embodiment of goodness.”
