Offensive describes rude or hurtful behavior, or a military or sports incursion into on opponent's
territory. In any context, on the offensive means on the attack.

Although offense and defense are opposites, offensive and defensive aren't always. Defensive can
mean anxiously challenging of all criticism. Offensive can mean not just attacking someone or
something, but belching, insulting people, or otherwise not respecting common standards of behavior.
