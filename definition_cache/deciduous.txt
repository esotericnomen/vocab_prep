Hemlock, blue spruce, and white pine are all evergreens. These trees have leaves throughout the
year. Oak, maple, and elm are examples of deciduous trees. They lose their foliage in the fall and
grow new leaves in the spring.

Trees, shrubs, and herbaceous perennials that shed their leaves for part of the year are categorized
by botanists as deciduous. In temperate and polar regions, these plants are generally bare during
the cold of winter. In other parts of the world, deciduous plants lose their leaves during the dry
part of the year. The word deciduous can also be used to describe parts of the body, such as a
deer's antlers or human baby teeth, that are cast off seasonally or at a particular period of
development.
