An exhibition is a collection of items for public display, like an exhibition of children’s
artwork, antique vases, or memorabilia from a science fiction movie series.

In the 19th century, exhibition was used to refer to a collection of objects, while exhibit
designated a single item in an exhibition. Nowadays, exhibition and exhibit are often used
interchangeably. Exhibition comes from the Latin ex-, meaning out, and habere, meaning hold — as
objects in an exhibition are held out, or shown, to the public. The h in hold out might help you
remember to include the h when spelling exhibition.
