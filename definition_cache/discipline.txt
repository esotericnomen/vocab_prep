When you have discipline, you have self-control. When you discipline children, you are either
teaching them to be well-behaved, or you are punishing and correcting them.

The origins of this word offer great clues about its current meanings. The Old French descepline
referred to punishment and suffering. The Latin disciplina meant teaching, learning. The Old English
version referred to a branch of knowledge or field of study (so if you're really good at word
origins, you might want to make etymology your discipline). Developing discipline as a form of
training is a military concept that's more than 500 years old.
