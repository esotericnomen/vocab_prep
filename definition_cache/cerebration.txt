Cerebration is a noun that means the thought process. When you need more time to answer a
complicated question, just say your cerebration isn't complete yet.

When you see the “cere” bit in this word, it might remind you of the word cerebrum, meaning
brain, or related words like cerebral or cerebellum. All of these are linked to cerebrum, which even
in Latin times was the word for brain. Cerebration is also a brainy word, a noun that’s used to
indicate the act of thinking. For people who enjoy pondering, cerebration is a celebration.
