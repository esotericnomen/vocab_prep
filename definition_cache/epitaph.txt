Epitaph is an inscription on a gravestone. Famous for his comedic jabs at the City of Brotherly
Love, writer W.C. Fields once said he wanted I'd rather be living in Philadelphia as the epitaph on
his tombstone.

Once you trace this word back to its origins, you'll never forget its meaning. Forms of it show up
in Middle English, Old French, Latin, and, before that, Greek: epi- upon and taphos tomb. This gives
us a mini history lesson on burial traditions. For thousands of years various societies have carved
poetic, weepy, and witty words onto the monuments marking the final resting places of famous and
infamous citizens.
