That seductive gleam on that Porsche behind the dealer's window? It's called a burnish, a gloss only
achieved by loads of polishing. Likewise, you can burnish resume, by polishing it until it's
perfect.

A caution about usage: burnish in the physical sense is usually reserved for inanimate objects
â&euro;&rdquo; a woman will not be happy to hear that her appearance is burnished to perfection.
But your car will thank you. Also, one of the most common non-physical things to be burnished? A
reputation. People are forever burnishing them â&euro;&rdquo; and its opposite, besmirching them
(i.e., making them dirty).
