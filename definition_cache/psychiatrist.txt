A psychiatrist is a doctor who specializes in emotional, behavioral, or mental disorders. Sigmund
Freud is the founder of the field of psychiatry, pioneering psychoanalytic treatment.

The noun psychiatrist has Greek roots in psykhe, meaning mind, and iatreia, meaning healing, so the
word psychiatrist is literally one who heals the mind. As opposed to a psychologist, who also offers
psychotherapy, a psychiatrist is a medical doctor and, as such, can prescribe medication for things
like depression and anxiety.
