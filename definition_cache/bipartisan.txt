If something is bipartisan, it has the support of two political parties that normally don’t agree
on much. You might read about a bipartisan plan to improve the school system where you live.

The word bipartisan is easy to figure out when you break it apart: bi-, meaning “two,” plus
partisan, meaning supporter of a party. So something that’s bipartisan involves two parties
finding enough common ground to support the same thing. A key aspect of something that’s
bipartisan is that the two parties involved typically hold opposing views about the best way to do
things, so a bipartisan agreement is one that likely involved a lot of effort, compromise, and
cooperation.
