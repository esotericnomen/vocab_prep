An emetic is a medicine or potion that makes you vomit, which you might be given if you've taken
poison or some other harmful substance.

You can also use the word emetic in a more figurative sense to describe anything that makes you feel
sick Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; the motion of a boat rocked by a storm could easily be an emetic, and the tuna
sandwich the guy sitting next to you on the bus has just unwrapped might also be an emetic for
everyone sitting nearby.
