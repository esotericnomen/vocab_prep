The brain is the most complex organ in the body, located inside the protective skull. The word can
also be used as a verb in the phrase to brain, which means to injure or kill someone by hitting them
in the head.

The human brain has inspired many idioms, or colorful phrases. Thinking intently (or obsessively)
about something means that you've got it on the brain, and to pick someone's brain means to get
their ideas on something. A puzzle is a brainteaser, someone smart is called a brain, and the person
who runs something is said to be the brains of the operation.
