To comprise is to make up or form. John, Paul, George, and Ringo comprise the Beatles, and the
periodic table is comprised of 118 elements.

Comprise is a term for describing what something includes or contains. It does not work, however, in
the active sense. While you can include your friends in your holiday plans, you can't comprise them.
However, when describing who tagged along on the ski trip, you can say that the chalet's cozy
bedrooms comprised a who's-who of your favorite people.
