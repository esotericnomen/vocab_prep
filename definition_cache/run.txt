When you run, you move along quickly, and for a long time if you're running a marathon. You can also
run a campaign or a business — you make them function.

There are plenty of meanings for run. If you're plotting your escape from the Tower of London, you
can make a run for it, and if you're a baseball player, you're a hero if you make a home run. When
your play opens on Broadway, you hope it will have many performances — a long run — and if
you're lucky, the New York Times will run a rave review.
