What do ministers, priests, rabbis, and children have in common? They all might attend a school that
has the word seminary in its name. A seminary is a school, especially one where people train to be
religious leaders.

Seminary comes from the Latin word seminarium, meaning plant nursery, which can be interpreted as,
breeding ground. Like a greenhouse that provides ideal conditions for seeds to grow into hearty
plants, a seminary was first a place for young men to become priests. Seminary typically describes
religious institutions but it can apply to nonreligious schools as well.
