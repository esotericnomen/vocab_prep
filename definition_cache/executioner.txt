An executioner is a government official who kills people sentenced to death. Executioners kill
legally.

There are many people who kill, such as murderers, soldiers, and hunters. Another is the
executioner, whose job is to kill. If a king or legal system has decided that someone will be put to
death, it's the executioner's job to kill them. Over time, executioners have used hanging,
beheading, lethal injections, the electric chair, and many other ways of executing (killing).
Without a doubt, being an executioner is one of the grimmest jobs in the world.
