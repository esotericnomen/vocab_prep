A gaffe is mistake that embarrasses you in front of others. If you run into a friend out with her
grey-haired father, and you blurt out, Oh, hi, you must be Tara's grandfather! then you've made a
gaffe.

Gaffe rhymes with laugh, and you'll be lucky if that's how people respond to your social blunder. A
gaffe seems to occur most often when you literally don't know your audience Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; you make
a joke about the mayor; you didn't know you were talking to his sister. That's definitely a gaffe.
And who knew your hosts come from a culture that takes offense if you refuse to try every dish?
