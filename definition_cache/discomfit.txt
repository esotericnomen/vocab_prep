To discomfit someone is to make them feel uncomfortable or upset. An easy way to discomfit another
person is to use the age-old, childish trick of ignoring them. (Of course, we’re sure you would
never do that, right? Right?)

If you make someone blush, sweat, and generally want to disappear, you’ve discomfited her.
Centuries ago, discomfit was used to mean “destroy completely in battle” — an experience that
surely left the defeated armies feeling something more than mere discomfort. Some scholars have
suggested that the contemporary meaning of discomfit arose due to confusion with the word
discomfort. Don’t be discomfited by choosing the wrong word; use this word to mean
“embarrass.”
