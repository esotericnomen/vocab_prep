Combustible means able to catch fire, like matches or the extremely dry forest floors that people
sometimes forget are combustible — until they go up in flames.

When the adjective combustible first entered the English language in the sixteenth century, it was
used to describe things that burn easily. The word soon came to apply not only to objects that
ignite but also to tempers that are prone to catch fire easily. If you’ve ever been around a
person who has a combustible temper, you can understand the connection.
