If you attend school, you probably have a favorite class â€” a series of lectures or discussions
where you can learn about a particular subject, like English, math, or economics.

The characteristic of being high quality or displaying elegance is also called class. Your snobby
friend might glance around your favorite diner and say, Let's go somewhere else. This place has no
class. In society, class refers to a ranking system based on socio-economics, birth, education
level, or a combination of those things. Your ancestors might have been working class, until your
grandfather struck it rich.
