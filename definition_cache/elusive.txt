Things that are elusive hard to find, pin down, or remember. They slip right out of your grasp.

Ever try to catch a mouse? It's not easy, because mice are quick and elusive â&euro;&rdquo; they're
tough to catch. Rabbits are speedy, so they're elusive too. Also, things that are tough to
understand or describe are elusive â&euro;&rdquo; like the concepts of love and beauty. If you had
an idea and then forgot it, the idea is elusive: it slipped away. Anything you can't get hold of,
with your hands or with your brain, is elusive.
