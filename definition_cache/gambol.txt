To gambol is to run around playing excitedly. There are some really fun-sounding synonyms for
gambol, such as frolic, romp, and cavort, and though it sounds like gamble, when you gambol with an
ol you never lose â€” you just have a great time!

If you've ever sprinted around, jumping up and down, yelling woo-hoo!, you already know how to
gambol. Being really excited or even just slap-happy makes people gambol, and it's so energizing
that animals do it too. Dogs gambol when they rise on two legs to greet each other, and squirrels
gambol when they chase each other up and down trees. And when springtime comes after a long winter,
it seems to make every living thing gambol with extra life.
