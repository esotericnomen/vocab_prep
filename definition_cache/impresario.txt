An impresario is a promoter: someone who books, promotes, and organizes shows such as concerts.

Impresario comes from an Italian word for a businessperson, and in English it especially refers to
someone in the promotion business. In the music business, Bill Graham was a famous impresario who
arranged concerts for huge bands such as The Rolling Stones and Pink Floyd. An impresario signs a
band â&euro;&rdquo; or other entertainment â&euro;&rdquo; and makes a deal with the venue.
Impresarios then arrange advertising and promotion to alert fans and arrange for tickets to be sold.
Impresarios make shows happen.
