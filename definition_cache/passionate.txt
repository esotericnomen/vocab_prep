Something that is passionate packs emotion, and possibly romantic emotion. A passionate plea will
tug on your heart strings and a passionate kiss will sweep you off your feet. If you want to stay
unmoved, stay away from the passionate.

If you're passionate about soccer, you can't get enough of it -- you've got soccer pennants
plastered on your walls, your TV is permanently tuned to the soccer channel, and you probably wear
soccer jerseys under your button-down shirt. Passion can also come from intense feelings of love for
a person. Be careful -- you could be swept up in a passionate embrace.
