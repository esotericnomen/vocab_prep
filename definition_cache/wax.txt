The verb wax is most often found in the company of its opposite, wane. To wax is to grow larger or
increase, whereas wane means to grow smaller or decrease.

As the moon grows towards fullness, it waxes. It wanes, or diminishes in size, as the new moon
approaches. This is the most common context for the verb wax, but it is also used to describe other
phenomena that grow or increase, particularly those that are cyclical. Figuratively, if you wax
eloquent, lyrical or poetic about something, you talk about it at great length and with growing
enthusiasm. The noun wax refers to chemical compounds that can be shaped and molded, for example
into candles, when warm.
