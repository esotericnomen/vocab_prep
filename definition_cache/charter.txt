What do rock gods do when they travel? They charter their own plane, of course. Charter means you
rent or lease a particular service or object. Anyone can charter something, though lesser mortals
tend to limit themselves to buses.

Charter comes from the Latin charta, meaning paper, card or map. As a noun, charter refers to a
written document outlining -- or mapping -- the rights and obligations of a company or organization,
or even, in older days, a town or entire colony. New York City was given a charter, for example, by
the British monarch in the 17th century, guaranteeing it certain rights in exchange for goods and
services. Today corporations still have charters governing their behavior.
