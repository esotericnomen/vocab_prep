Her big eyes and plump lips are distinctive features that make her a great model. These are just

You might recognize the Latin prefix dis in the adjective distinctive. Dis often means apart or
away. Think of this when trying to remember the word distinctive. Someone with distinctive features
has features that set them apart from others. Yes, its stepped-back architecture and distinctive
spire are among the Empire State Building's distinctive features, but its most distinctive feature
has to be its height: for decades there wasn't another building in New York that came close!
