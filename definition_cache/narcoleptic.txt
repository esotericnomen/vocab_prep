Someone who's narcoleptic has a disorder that makes them fall asleep very abruptly in the middle of
the day. A narcoleptic bus driver could be dangerous.

Narcoleptic can be an adjective or a noun, describing the condition of narcolepsy or a person who
suffers from it. A narcoleptic has a sleep disorder that makes him exhausted, even after a full
night's sleep. Some narcoleptics drop off to sleep in the middle of a sentence, while others just
become very sleepy throughout the day. A French doctor coined the word narcolepsie from the Greek
roots narke, numbness or stupor, and lepsis, attack or seizure.
