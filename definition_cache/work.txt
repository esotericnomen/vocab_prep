The word work has many shades of meaning, but most involve putting in an effort of some sort. You're
not going to become an Olympic ice skater overnight. You'll need to do a serious amount of work to
get there.

When you say you have to go to work, work is a noun meaning your workplace. The actual tasks you
perform at your workplace â&euro;&rdquo; what you get paid for â&euro;&rdquo; are also called
work. Your work might consist of answering the phone or baking bread or doing the accounting. Work
can also be a verb describing doing some kind of activity, often one associated with your job. It's
a bummer to work on Saturday when you already worked all week.
