Among other things, blue is a color and a dreary mood. If the blue sky and ocean have turned gray
and stormy, you might be blue because your day at the beach is ruined.

Whether it's a primary color or a saddened mood, blue is used often as an adjective for people and
things. Blue is a mix of green and purple shades, and it's the favorite color of many. The color
blue might bring thoughts of first-place blue ribbons or police officers in blue uniforms, and it
colors many flags of the world. Blue is everywhere, but there isn't a lot of blue food unless it's
colored with dye. Even blueberries are mostly purple.
