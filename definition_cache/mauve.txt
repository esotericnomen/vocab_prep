Mauve is a paler tone of the color purple, and for some strange reason a beloved color for mothers
of the bride.

Mauve is often considered a somewhat wishy-washy color, inoffensive and bland. After all, the
American novelist Alice Walker didn't entitle her great 1982 novel about black women's' lives in the
American South The Color Mauve; she called it The Color Purple Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; far more suggestive
of the powerful, violence-soaked drama it is.
