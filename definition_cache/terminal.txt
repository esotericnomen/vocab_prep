Terminal is a word with many meanings. Depending on how it's used, it can describe a place where
passengers end their journey, a computer screen and keyboard, or a life-ending disease.

As a noun, terminal describes a bus or train station at the end of the line. When your aunt takes
the bus into town, you pick her up at the terminal. Her visit becomes very sad when your aunt tells
you she's been diagnosed with an illness that's terminal Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; an adjective meaning she
hasn't long to live. This is surprising news, since you've always believed your aunt is a
hypochondriac. Now you have to go to your computer terminal and look up her disease.
