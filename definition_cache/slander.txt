If you call your teacher a dirty toad, you're going to get into trouble––she'll call you out on
the slander. Slander is the act of making a false, negative spoken statement about someone.

In law, the word slander is contrasted with libel, which is the act of making a false written
statement about someone. The noun slander is from Old French esclandre, escandle scandal, from Late
Latin scandalum stumbling block, offense.
