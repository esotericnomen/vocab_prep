Overblown describes fears or concerns that are excessive, such as a overblown worry that people will
notice a spot of dirt on your shoe and decide not to be your friend anymore.

Overblown is a word gardeners use to describe their flowers that, having bloomed, now hang heavy on
their stems. You can use it to describe other things that are past their prime like an overblown
fashion trend everyone is tired of. Another meaning is an extreme display of vanity, like the
overblown decorating style of a famous actor's home Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; complete with photos,
memorabilia from past films, and award trophies everywhere you look.
