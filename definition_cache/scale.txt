How much do you love pizza? Rate it on a scale of one to ten, with one being blech and ten being
amazing. A scale is a series that climbs up or down in a step-wise fashion. To scale something is to
climb it, as in scale a ladder, where you work your way up step by step.

Think of a musical scale: do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do, and then think of a scale you weigh yourself
on––it counts up the pounds one after another after another. Scale can be a ratio too––when
maps are drawn to scale, that means one mile of real road might translate to one inch of road on the
map. Even fish scales can be understood this way––they repeat the same shape row after row after
row.
