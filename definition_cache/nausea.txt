When you feel like you might throw up, that's nausea. I know you're feeling sea sick, but if our
boat sinks, nausea will be the least of your problems.

Nausea gets its root from the Greek word for ship, naus, so it might have originally meant sea
sickness in particular.  Remembering this origin might help you spell nausea correctly too, since it
ends with â&euro;&oelig;sea.â&euro;?  But nausea can strike on dry land just as well, from eating
the wrong thing, catching the flu, reading on a moving bus . . . just thinking of it all makes me
sick to my stomach.
