Granulated means to form or reduce into grains. You've probably seen the word on a box of granulated
sugar and not thought twice about the fact that, besides its granular form, sugar exists as a liquid
and also inside sugar cane.

Sugar, of course, is not a grain. A grain is rice, wheat, quinoa,
cornâ&euro;&ldquo;â&euro;&ldquo;seeds that form the basis of most people's diets. Sugar forms
grains when it's refined, appearing in its crystallized form to have a grain-like, or granulated,
appearance.
