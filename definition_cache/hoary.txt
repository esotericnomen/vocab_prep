Use the adjective hoary to describe something that is old and worn out — like the hoary jokes your
great uncle Albert clings to.

The word hoary can also be used to describe something that is white or gray with age. Santa is
usually depicted with a hoary beard and hoary hair, although sometimes mall Santas have to fake this
with wigs and artificial beards. Hoary can also mean covered with white down — The hoary leaves
felt like velvet to the touch.
