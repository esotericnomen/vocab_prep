When something absolutely has to be done and cannot be put off, use the adjective imperative.

Imperative is from Latin imperare to command, and its original use was for a verb form expressing a
command: Do it! is an imperative sentence. It's still used that way, but it's more commonly applied
to something so pressing it cannot be put off: Hiring new workers has become imperative.  It has
more immediate force than pressing but less than urgent.
