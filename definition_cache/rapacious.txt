Something rapacious is out to devour — anything, and little can stand in its way. A rapacious
landlord is out for more rent, and a rapacious eater is only satisfied at the all-you-can-eat
buffet.

A 17th-century word, from the Latin rapere, to snatch, rapacious originally described the people and
animals who often preyed on weaker creatures and devoured them, by eating them or by ruining them
through some scandal. Modern-day companies even get the label rapacious when their appetites for
profit seem to devour lesser interests, like the environment and employee benefits.
