Use the word cherubic to describe someone with a round face and an air of sweetness, whether
you’re talking about a cute cooing baby or your innocent-looking, round-faced 40-year-old brother.

The word cherubic, pronounced CHAIR-uh-bick, is used to describe someone who looks like a cherub, a
baby-like angel you’ve probably seen in Renaissance paintings. Today, you don’t have to be
divine, winged, naked, or even a child to be described as cherubic. The word describes those who
have a rosy, childlike innocence and a sweet, pleasing roundness.
