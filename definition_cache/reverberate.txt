If you give a loud shout in a cavernous place, like a gym, or a church, the sound of your voice will
reverberate throughout the room. Reverberate means sound waves traveling back and forth, as in an
echo.

Often we use reverberate to talk about sound, or sometimes light. If a noise echoes for a long time,
we can say the space reverberates with that noise. You may have heard of a reverb effect in audio
processing, which is basically a long echo. We also use the word metaphorically to describe the
impact of huge events. For example, the 2008 mortgage crisis in the US reverberated throughout the
world√¢&euro;&trade;s economy, causing a global recession.
