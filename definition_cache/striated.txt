If a field is plowed into furrows, it's striated––or, technically, it's marked with striae,
which are stripes or grooves.

When you see striate, think of stripes. When you draw a row of stripes in clay with the tines of a
fork, you're striating it. A striated rock surface might show evidence of the movement of glaciers
thousands of years ago. Striated muscle has a striped appearance.
