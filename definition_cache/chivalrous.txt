A man who is courteous and attentive to women can be described as chivalrous: “The chivalrous
stranger picked up the packages Veronica dropped and held the door open while she entered the
apartment building.”

The word chivalrous originally described gallantry, valor, honor, and courtesy, associated with the
medieval code of knighthood. Medieval knights are no longer with us, but chivalrous has survived in
modern usage to describe a man — or a behavior — showing courtesy or attentiveness toward women.
So the guy holding the door open for you with a flourish may or may not be your “knight in shining
armor, but his chivalrous act gives him something in common with the medieval knights of lore.
