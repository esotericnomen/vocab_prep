Try to remember that uncertain means equivocal and certain means unequivocal. That's a tricky
movement the un- is making, and a lot of people get stumped.

From the Latin aequus 'equal, the same' + vocare to call, equivocal describes when something is too
close to call. Whose hand first touched the last brownie on the plate? We asked everyone but the
answers were equivocal.
