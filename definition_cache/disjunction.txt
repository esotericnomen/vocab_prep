A disjunction is a broken connection. If you expect to be a doctor but you haven't taken any science
courses since high school biology, you would have a disjunction between your expectations and your
training.

The -junct- in disjunction is the same Latin root that gives us yoke, the harness that joins two
oxen together. So if you have a disjunction, things are not joined together — there's a
disconnect. If you order a pizza and the waiter brings you caviar, that's a disjunction. In logic, a
disjunction is made by joining two sentences with or — I'm tired, or I'm hungry — while a
conjunction joins two sentences with and — I'm tired, and I'm hungry.
