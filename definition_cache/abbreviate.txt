To abbreviate is to shorten. Words are often abbreviated, like when we say sked instead of schedule.

Though we most often think about words being abbreviated â&euro;&rdquo; especially terms like OMG
and LOL for oh my God and laugh out loud â&euro;&rdquo; lots of things can be abbreviated. You just
have to shorten them. Sudden rain might abbreviate a baseball game. A bomb threat would abbreviate a
school day. Anytime something is being shortened or cut, abbreviation is going on.
