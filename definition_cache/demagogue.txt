A demagogue is someone who becomes a leader largely because of skills as a speaker or who appeals to
emotions and prejudices.

Though the Greek root for demagogue literally means a leader of the people, the word has for
centuries had a negative connotation: it actually means a leader who has manipulated the emotions
and prejudices of the rabble. The reason for the negative connotation is that in ancient Athens, the
people were considered to be an uncivilized mob. Two of the most famous historical demagogues are
said to be Adolf Hitler and Josef Stalin.
