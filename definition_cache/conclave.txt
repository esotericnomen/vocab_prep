A private or secret meeting is a conclave. What are some reasons you might hold a conclave? You
might be convening the executive committee on the board of a company, or you might be planning a
surprise party.

In Catholicism, a conclave is specifically a meeting of Roman Catholic cardinals who are locked in a
room in seclusion when they need to choose a new pope. The word conclave comes from the Latin and
originally meant a locked room. The school's band boosters held a conclave to discuss the harsh
district budget cuts and how those cuts might affect all the other music programs at school.
