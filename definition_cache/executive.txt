An executive is a powerful person who is responsible for making things run smoothly.  If you become
an executive, you might be in charge of an organization, a business, or even an entire country.

The executive of a company has the best office and works on ways to make their business more
successful.  The Medieval Latin root of executive is exsequi, which means â&euro;&oelig;carry
out,â&euro;? and so an executive carries out plans and actions.  Executive is also an adjective
that describes having the power to make decisions.  The president of the United States is the
executive branch of the government and is responsible for executing laws that will improve the
country for its citizens.
