Something that has been felled has been brought down, like a tree that has been felled by a powerful
storm.

The word fell wears many hats in addition to being the past tense of fall. As a noun, a fell can be
a stitching on the hem of a piece of clothing like pants, or an animal skin that has the fur intact.
In Shakespeare’s Macbeth, the character MacDuff is stricken when he learns that his family has
been killed “in one fell swoop.” Here the adjective fell means vicious and cruel.
