Deranged means insane. You've probably read headlines about deranged murderers, but someone might
also be called deranged for bizarre behavior like wearing a bathing suit while skiing.

Crazed, insane, demented, unbalanced, and unhinged are all synonyms for deranged. The literal
meaning for deranged was originally “out of order, so think of it as describing someone whose
thoughts are not in order. The madwoman in Bronte’s Jane Eyre is a classic deranged character:
“In the deep shade, at the farther end of the room, a figure ran backwards and forwards. What it
was, whether beast or human being, one could not, at first sight tell.”
