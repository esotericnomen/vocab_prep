When you inhibit something, you block it or hold it back. If you put plants in a dark room, you
inhibit their growth. A teacher who mocks their students for giving wrong answers inhibits their
willingness to speak up in class.

When you look at the word inhibit, think hinder. Though it sounds like it might be a bad thing to
inhibit something else, there is no judgment built into the word. A drug that inhibits the growth of
cancer cells would generally be considered a very good thing. While you may wish cancer cells to be
inhibited, you probably don't wish it upon your friend's sense of humor or your country's economic
growth.
