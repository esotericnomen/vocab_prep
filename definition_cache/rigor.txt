When a private school boasts of its academic rigor, it means its students learn a lot and work
really hard. Rigor means thoroughness and exhaustiveness––the gold standard for a good teacher.

You may have heard of rigor mortis––which is a medical term describing the stiffness of a body
after death. Rigor used to mean stiffness outside of the corpse context, i.e., sternness. The word
changes meaning along with our changing standards for what we want teachers to be.
