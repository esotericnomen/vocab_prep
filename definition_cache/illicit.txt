Illicit means not allowed by law or custom. An illicit drug trade is one that happens under the
radar of the law.

Illicit usually refers to something that is not morally proper or acceptable, such as an illicit
affair with a married man, or illicit sex. Illicit is from Latin illicitus, from the prefix in- not
plus licitus lawful.
