In wartime, you'll hear the word casualty used often for someone killed or injured. But casualty can
also refer to deaths or injuries suffered in an accident or some other unfortunate event.

The term casualties of war has been around for a while and refers to the ugly downside of military
victory. Anyone who loses life or limb, either in the fighting or as a civilian, is called a
casualty. If you're feeling poetic, though, you can extend the meaning to include, say, the children
of a divorce: while they don't die and aren't physically injured, their emotional suffering
qualifies them to be called casualties of their parents' fighting. Driving drunk, too, results in
casualties.
