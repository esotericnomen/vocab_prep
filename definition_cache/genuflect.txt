If you are genuflecting, you are on your knees â€” either physically or in spirit. Politicians are
experts at genuflecting to whatever idea or person is most popular at the time.

In the old days, when you came in front of your social superiors, you were expected to genuflect:
that is, bend your knee and bow submissively. You did it before kings and nobles, and everyone did
it in church before God. In our more egalitarian age, genuflecting has taken on a rather insincere
and servile meaning. Best not to genuflect, but simply to admire.
