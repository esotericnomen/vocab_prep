If you're nimble, you can move quickly and with ease. That spryness can be both physical and mental,
so even if your granny isn't very nimble on her feet, she can probably still whip you in chess.

A toddler might recognize the word nimble from the nursery rhyme: Jack be nimble / Jack be quick /
Jack jump over / The candlestick, but may not be nimble enough to deduce the meaning. Nimble, from
the 14th century Old English nĂŚmel, meaning quick to grasp, can refer to one's mental quickness
or physical agility.
