Use the word dangerous to describe anything that can potentially cause serious harm, like a snarling
pit bull or an icy, treacherous road.

The earliest meaning of the word dangerous was difficult or arrogant. When Geoffrey Chaucer wrote
The Canterbury Tales in the 1300s, he used dangerous to mean hard to please. Gradually the meaning
changed, so that by the late fifteenth century, dangerous meant liable to cause hurt or risky. Just
as popular were two other danger-related words that we don't use anymore today: dangersome and
dangerful, which at the time could be used interchangeably with dangerous.
