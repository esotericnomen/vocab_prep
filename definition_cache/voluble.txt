Voluble describes someone who talks a lot, like your aunt who can’t stop telling you to cut your
hair or a political candidate who makes twenty speeches on the day before the election.

Have you ever found it especially hard to interrupt someone who talks a lot when he or she gets on a
roll? If so, it won’t surprise you that the adjective voluble traces back to the Latin word
volvere, meaning “to roll.” The word voluble describes talking continuously, fluently, at great
length, in a steady flow. You’ll know it when you meet voluble talkers: they just keep rolling on
and on.
