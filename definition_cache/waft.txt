When your grandmother cooks her famous spaghetti sauce, many wonderful smells may waft from the
kitchen. In other words, the air will gently carry this familiar aroma throughout the house.

Though the verb waft usually involves movement through air, it has watery roots. A wafter was a
convoy ship in the 16th century, and these words may have derived from the similar looking wave.
Waft can refer to scents, sounds, and even smoke. So, if your grandmother√¢&euro;&trade;s sauce
begins to burn, smoke could waft from the kitchen as well.
