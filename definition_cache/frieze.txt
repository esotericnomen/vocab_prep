A frieze is a decorative band, usually, but not always, above a doorframe or on the wall near the
ceiling. You may find a frieze of sculptured angels too formal for the trim of your bedroom wall.

You might not think of a frieze in the same category as a painting or a statue, but it can be a true
work of art. One famous frieze is painted in a large circle on the inside of the United States
Capitol building; it shows famous events in American history. Another is at the Parthenon, a temple
from ancient Greece. Don√¢&euro;&trade;t confuse frieze with the more common term freeze, though
they are pronounced the same way.
