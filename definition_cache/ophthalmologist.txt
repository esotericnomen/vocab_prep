If you can't see the board from your desk, it might be time to visit an ophthalmologist, or eye
doctor, to see if you need glasses.

An ophthalmologist is a doctor whose specialty is diseases and conditions of the eyes, especially
things that relate to vision. She's the doctor who examines your eyes and writes the prescription
for your contact lenses. The Greek root word is ophthalmos, which means eye. Ophthalmologist is a
tricky word to spell, particularly because many people tend to skip both the ph and the first l when
they pronounce it.
