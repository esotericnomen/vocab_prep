An optometrist specializes in testing the eyes and helping correct vision with glasses or contact
lenses. If you can’t read anything below the giant E on the doctor's wall chart, don’t worry: an
optometrist can help improve how you see.

Words starting with opto- are related to vision, and an optometrist is trained in finding problems
with the eyes and recommending treatment or correction. Optometry is the science of studying the
eyes or vision, and an optometrist is specialized in this study. Two words that are sometimes
confused are optometrist and optician. While an optometrist is someone who examines and treats the
eyes, an optician works with the optometrist to make the corrective glasses or contact lenses a
patient needs.
