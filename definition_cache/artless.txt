Yes, artless could mean lacking in art, but more often it means lacking in superficiality or deceit.
An artless person could never make a living as a con artist.

Originally meaning unskillful or uncultured, artless evolved into meaning not skilled or cultured in
the art of deceit. If you are artless, you are natural and uncontrived. Young people, animals, the
socially inept Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; these can all be artless in the way they express themselves. They
seem to mean exactly what they say.
