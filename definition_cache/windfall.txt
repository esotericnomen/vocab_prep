Lucky you! You just won the lottery and your windfall will make life very comfortable for you and
your family. A windfall is a crazy bit of unexpected good fortune.

First used in the fifteenth century, the word windfall originally referred to fruit that the wind
blew from the trees. Like a prize was there for whomever found it Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; no need for the
ladder and effort of picking it from the tall trees. The word eventually came to mean any unexpected
and easily-gained good fortune, typically one involving money, such as the windfall profit from a
lucky stock purchase.
