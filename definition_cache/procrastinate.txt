Procrastinates means putting off doing something until a future time. When people sit down to write
term papers, they can find all kinds of clever ways to procrastinate: reorganizing the paperclips,
calling everyone they know, typing I am bored fifty times in a row.

The verb procrastinate is from Latin prōcrāstināre, from prō- forward plus crāstinus of
tomorrow, from crās tomorrow. Some synonyms are defer, postpone, and delay, though these words
often apply to more positive reasons for inaction. The reason for procrastination is often assumed
to be laziness, or just that the task or action is unpleasant and difficult to begin.
