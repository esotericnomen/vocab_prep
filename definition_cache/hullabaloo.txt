Hullabaloo is a lovely term for a fuss or commotion, usually over something of little or no
importance, like a celebrity's new hair style.

Save hullabaloo for the trivial fuss. Anything of real importance -- a war, a murder, for example --
merits a more serious term like disturbance or outcry. Hullabaloo allegedly comes from the sound of
lots of people saying Hullo! Hullo! In other words, it's an onomatopoeic word, that is to say it
sounds like its meaning, like hiss or tick tock or oink. Curious fact: there's no plural to
hullabaloo: hullabaloos is not a word.
