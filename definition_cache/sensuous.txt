Anything that is pleasing to the senses can be called sensuous. The feel of a soft cashmere sweater
on your skin, the taste of dark chocolate, even the smell of your favorite person â€” all of these
can be sensuous experiences.

Sensuous describes anything that feels, tastes, smells, looks, or sounds good. Eating delicious food
or relaxing in a warm bath are sensuous activities. But something intellectually satisfying, like
doing a crossword puzzle or solving a math problem, is not exactly sensuous, even if you really like
doing it. Use sensuous to describe stuff that makes your five senses happy.
