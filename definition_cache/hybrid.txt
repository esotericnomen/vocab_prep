A hybrid is a mixture of two different things, resulting in something that has a little bit of both.
Like the rare zeedonk, a hybrid of a donkey and a zebra.

The word hybrid gets thrown around often these days Ã¢&euro;&rdquo;  ever heard of hybrid cars that
run on both electricity and fuel? Or hybrid films that are half animation, half live action? But
hybrid is really most at home in the realm of genetics and crossbreeding. It actually comes to us
from the Latin hybrida, meaning the offspring of two dissimilar animals, specifically a tame sow and
a wild boar.
