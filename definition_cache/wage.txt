If your job pays a good wage, it means that you earn a lot of money for the hard work you do. If
you're not happy with your wage, you might have to wage war on your boss.

Wage is one of those words whose verb and noun forms have entirely different meanings. A worker's
wage is how much money she makes. But when you wage something, you carry it out: for example, a
warmonger is someone whose primary goal is to wage wars. The word is of Germanic origin, and it's
related to both gage and wed, with their underlying meanings of to pledge.
