A protégé is a person who receives special protection and promotion from someone more established
in a field. If your boss introduces you as his newest protégé, you're off to a good start in your
career.

Essentially, a protégé is a teacher’s pet, someone who is given special status or favors. Often,
the word is used for someone who has special standout talent and is taken up as an upcoming star or
powerhouse. The word’s original associations, however, have nothing to do with talent and
everything to do with how a person treats the protégé — the source of the word means
“protection.”
