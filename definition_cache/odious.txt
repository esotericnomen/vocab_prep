If something is odious it's hateful. If you become a historian of slavery, you'll learn all the
details of that odious trade.

Odious is from the Latin noun odium, which means hatred. It is a strong word, so don't call someone
odious unless you want to accuse someone of being loathsome or vile. Actions can also be called
odious. A typical use is Shakespeare's in Othello: You told a lie, an odious damned lie. Some
synonyms are hateful, contemptible, detestable, and abominable.
