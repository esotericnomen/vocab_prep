Repulsion is getting grossed out. If the thought of great green globs of greasy grimy gopher guts
makes you recoil in horror, then you've experienced repulsion, or an intense aversion to something.

Where there's repulsion, there's disgust. Maybe gagging. Perhaps a few screams. In physics,
repulsion describes how two magnets with the same charge jump away from each other, kind of like how
most of us leap from the table when mom puts down a plate of Brussels sprouts.
