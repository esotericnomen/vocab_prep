Cows graze on grass people graze on snacks and finger-foods, like when you keep grabbing a handful
of chips every time you pass by the table at a get-together.

Graze means to feed on grass as sheep, horses, cows, do in a meadow — they eat a little at a time,
but constantly. People sometimes graze too, munching on small snacks all day long instead of having
a real meal. It also means “to touch lightly,” like when I pitch a baseball to you — and I
accidentally hit your arm. With luck, the ball only grazed you, meaning you aren't hurt at all.
