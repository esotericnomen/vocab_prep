Negative means focused on what is bad or lacking. A negative ad tells you bad things about the
competition. A negative person loves to complain.

In math, a negative number is less than zero. People who see the glass half empty have a negative
outlook. Ask your mom for ice cream and receive an answer in the negative? Don't be too negative
back to her, or it'll be a while before you have another chance at ice cream.
