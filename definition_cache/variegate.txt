To variegate is to make something more irregular, especially its color. You can variegate your yard
by planting different colors of blooming flowers all over it.

When you variegate your life in some way, you make it more interesting and varied. While it's more
common to see the adjective variegated, particularly when people talk about dappled or streaked
color, you can use the verb to talk about diversifying or mixing things. You can variegate your
education, for example, by studying many different subjects. The Latin root, variegare, means
diversify with different colors.
