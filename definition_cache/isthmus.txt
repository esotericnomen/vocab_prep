An isthmus is a land bridge, a narrow strip of land that stretches across a body of water to connect
two larger land masses.

The Greek isthmos means neck, so you can see how isthmus came to mean the connecting strip between
land masses. If you look at an example, say the Isthmus of Panama, you can see how that neck-like
bit of land separates the Caribbean Sea from the North Pacific Ocean as it connects North and South
America. Think of an isthmus as kind of like a turkey neck that connects the bird's body and head
(at least until Thanksgiving).
