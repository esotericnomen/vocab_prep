If there is a forceful flowing inward or coming in, you can say there is an influx. Every fall, the
college town sees an influx of students and the population jumps 30 percent.

Although anything flowing inward can be called an influx, there are several things this word is
commonly used to refer to: water, people, and cash. The dam burst, causing an influx of water to the
already swollen river. You just managed to avoid the influx of people mobbing the store looking to
be the first to buy the newest gaming system. Try to avoid a financial plan like this: once you win
the lottery, you'll use the influx of cash to pay off debts.
