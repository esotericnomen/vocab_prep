If you are provident, that means you plan carefully for the future. You have your Christmas lights
up in early December, you have a well-stocked pantry, and you have some savings tucked away just in
case.

The word provident traces back to the Latin word providere, meaning foresee, provide. The word can
be used to describe someone who looks into the future — foresees the future, in a sense — and
makes decisions based on future needs. It’s often used to describe a thrifty individual who denies
himself something today in order to save up for tomorrow, but it can describe actions as well —
such as a provident decision that ends up preventing ruin down the road.
