Use the adjective blighted to describe something that has a condition that makes it weak or unable
to grow, like a blighted lawn with more brown patches than green.

Language experts canâ&euro;&trade;t agree on the exact origins of the word blighted, but when it
entered English in the sixteenth century it was used to describe a skin condition. Today,
youâ&euro;&trade;ll hear the word applied to plants that are affected by a condition that causes
them to wither and die, like a blighted tomato crop, or to describe the neglect and decay of places,
such as blighted buildings that pose safety hazards.
