Indissoluble describes things that are really hard to destroy or dissolve and that last a long time,
like steel and hard plastic or strong friendships. At five syllables, the word in-dis-sol-u-ble
itself even lasts a long time in your mouth.

With roots dating back to the 15th century, indissoluble is a pretty tough adjective â&euro;&rdquo;
it has survived hundreds of years. You can put a brownie in water and it will dissolve in no time,
but a hockey puck in the same water is indissoluble, it wonâ&euro;&trade;t dissolve. An expression
for indissoluble relationships might be nothing can tear us apart, because there is so much strength
in the bond. A strong law or legal contract also is indissoluble, though the paper it's written on
is not.
