Hubbub is a fun, rhyming word for an uproar, a brouhaha, or another crazy situation that has gone
completely higgledy-piggledy.

No one would say, What's the hubbub? at the library, unless it was the loudest, most bonkers day
ever in a place that is usually quiet. A hubbub is chaotic, disorganized, loud, and distracting.
Sometimes, hubbub can mean a controversy, as in What's the hubbub over this new law? If you like
peace and quiet, stay away from hubbubs Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; a word that sounds as loud and unruly as its
meaning.
