If you usually do something, that’s what you do on a normal day. Tonight you might be making a
seven-course meal to celebrate your birthday, even though usually you just get take-out pizza.

Usual comes from the word use, and implies the most common use. A screwdriver usually drives screws
into something, or takes them out. Unusually, you have strung your screwdriver on a chain and are
wearing it as a necklace. You can also say usually to describe the normal state of things: On New
Year’s Eve, this usually quiet street erupts with noise.
