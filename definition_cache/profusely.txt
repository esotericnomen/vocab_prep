Profusely is another way of saying excessively. If you sweat profusely whenever your crush walks
into a room, you might reconsider your ban on deodorant before asking him out.

Profuse is an adjective meaning, basically, a lot. Add the -ly and there's the adverb profusely,
used to describe something that's giving off a lot — of blood, sweat, and tears for example. You
might bleed profusely after you cut your thumb and cry profusely when your sweetie doesn't even
offer you a Band-Aid. Other words with similar meanings include abundantly, extravagantly, lavishly,
and richly. The French author Francois de la Rochefoucauld said, “Nothing is given so profusely as
advice.”
