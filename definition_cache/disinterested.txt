If you can't decide whether to purchase the shirt with orange polka dots or the purple paisley-
patterned one, you might seek input from a disinterested, or unbiased, party (who will probably tell
you not to buy either one).

Depending on whom you ask, disinterested is either one of the most commonly misused words in the
English language, or a perfect example of usage experts and English teachers being way too uptight.
While everyone agrees that disinterested can mean “unbiased,” the debate rages on as to whether
it can also mean “uninterested” or “indifferent.” Sticklers are vehemently opposed to this
secondary meaning. (Of course, you’ll also find the disinterested — or uninterested? — folks
who couldn’t care less.)
