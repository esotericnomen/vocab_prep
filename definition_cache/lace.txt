Your grandmother's kitchen curtains might be made from lace, a delicate fabric with twists and loops
forming patterns of holes.

Lace is often used for fancy dresses, special doilies and tablecloths, and decorative accents. You
can also use the noun lace to describe the cord your tie your sneakers with, and the verb lace can
mean twist or braid or intertwine: The two friends lace their arms around each other and skip across
the playground. Lace is surprisingly related to lasso, a loop of rope carried by a cowboy
Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; both words are rooted in the Latin laqueus, noose or snare.
