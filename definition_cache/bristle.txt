A bristle is a stiff hair — the kind men shave off their face or the kind badgers have all over.
Bristle also means to get angry. Tell an animal rights activist you use a badger's bristle shaving
brush and you'll get the idea.

The emotional meaning of to bristle comes from the fact that most animal bristles used by man are
so-called erectile hairs — the ones that stand up on the neck or along the back of animal when
it's angry or surprised. A common word associated with bristle is hackle, another name for such
erectile animal hairs. Thus the saying to get one's hackles up, which is pretty much identical to
bristling.
