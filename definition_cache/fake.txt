You should have known that copy of the Declaration of Independence was a fake when you saw it was
signed by Jon Hancrock instead of John Hancock. Something that's fake isn't authentic.

A person who falsely claims to be, feel, or do something can be said to be fake. When your friend
acts sweet but spreads rumors about you behind your back, you can call her a fake. As a verb, fake
means to take an action with the intent to deceive. If you've ever tried to fake a grade on your
report card, you know that it's especially hard to change an F to an A.
