A torso is no more than the trunk of the human body — minus arms, legs, and heads. Joggers or
early morning dog walkers frequently find torsos. And then the police are called.

A statue of a torso, usually ancient Greek or Roman, is that of the trunk of a human body. But even
here, violence is implied, as originally the statue did have arms, legs and a head, of course.
Better to be a bust — a statue of the trunk with head attached.
