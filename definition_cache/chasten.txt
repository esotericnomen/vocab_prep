To chasten someone is to correct him or her, often with the use of some pretty steep punishment.
Chasten can also mean to restrain. Either of these actions may be necessary when someone isn't
behaving like they're supposed to.

The verb chasten is often used with the verb to be as in be chastened. If students are caught
writing graffiti on the bathroom wall, you can expect them to be chastened by both the school and
their parents. Chasten is related to the word chastise, meaning to punish severely. Both words can
be traced back to the Latin root castus, meaning morally pure. So keep yourself on the straight and
narrow when it comes to morality and you can avoid being chastened.
