A good place to see a display of lachrymose sorrow is at a funeral â€” people sobbing openly or
sniffling quietly into their hankies. To be lachrymose, in other words, is to be tearful.

Lachrymose is not a word used much in everyday speech; you wouldn't say, for example, I feel a bit
lachrymose today. No, you'd probably say, I feel a bit weepy today. Lachrymose is generally confined
to use as a written critical term, often meaning much the same as sentimental. Books and plays and
films can all be lachrymose, if their intent is to induce shameless sniveling.
