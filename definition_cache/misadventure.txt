Ever climb a ladder and then, when you’re at the top, the ladder tips over, leaving you stranded
up there?  That’s the start of a misadventure, an unfortunate situation that happens because of
bad luck.

Kids are always having misadventures. Falling into a pit of mud, getting stuck between slats in a
fence, a monkey stealing the shirt off your back: all classic misadventures. The word is rooted in
the French word mesaventure, which translates to “turn out badly.” Some misadventures are only
embarrassing, while others are exhausting and sad. The worst part? You can’t prevent a
misadventure, because they happen by chance.
