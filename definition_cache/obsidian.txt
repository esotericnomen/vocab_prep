Obsidian is a type of black or dark glass formed from cooling lava. So if you find a shiny, hard,
dark piece of glass next time you’re hanging around a volcano, it’s probably a piece of
obsidian.

The word obsidian essentially means “stone of Obsius.” So who was Obsius? According to an
ancient Roman writer, he was the guy who first found this type of stone in Ethiopia. You’ll find
obsidian used as a modifier a lot. Think of an obsidian arrowhead, blade or mirror. Sometimes it is
used as a fancy way of describing people’s eyes in romance novels as in, “Her eyes were dark and
shining, two obsidian orbs.”
