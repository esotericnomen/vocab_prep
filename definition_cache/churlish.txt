A churlish person is one whose middle name might as well be Rude. He’s the one who was never
taught to mind his manners and avoid telling vulgar jokes at the dinner table.

Churlish has its origins in late Old English, but its modern-day meaning of “deliberately rude”
developed in the 14th century. It’s a fitting adjective to describe boorish or surly behavior. It
can also describe a material that is difficult to work with, such as hard wood that’s resistant to
quick whittling. Our prolific pal Shakespeare coined the phrase, “as valiant as the lion, churlish
as the bear.”
