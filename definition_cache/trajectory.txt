If you stay on your current trajectory of constant partying, dining out, and yacht rentals, you'll
end up broke. A trajectory is the path of an object through space, or the path of life that a person
chooses.

Trajectory comes from the Latin trajectoria, which means throw across.  The prefix tra- is short for
trans-, which means across (think transport and transit) and the ject comes from jacere, which means
throw and is also the root of the word jet.  If you wanted to describe the path of a jet through the
sky, you could refer to the jet's trajectory.
