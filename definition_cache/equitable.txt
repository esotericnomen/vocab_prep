If you work on a group project in class, you want an equitable share of the credit, you want as much
credit as you deserve for your work. Equitable distribution means each party gets the share of
something that they deserve.

When you look at equitable, you might think you see the word, equal, but it doesn't mean fair in the
sense of exactly the same. If you worked ten hours at a lemonade stand and your friend worked five,
you'd want an equitable share of the profits rather than an equal share. Equitable would take into
account the amount of work you did, equal would not.
