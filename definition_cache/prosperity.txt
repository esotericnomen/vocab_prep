Use prosperity to refer to the state of being successful. In the US, the decades following World War
II were characterized by rising prosperity, with large numbers moving into the middle class.

Prosperity usually means the type of success that comes from having a lot of money. Our modern
English word derives from Middle English prosperite, borrowed through Old French from Latin
prosperus favorable. The Latin word also means fortunate, and the word prosperity does have an
element of good luck.
