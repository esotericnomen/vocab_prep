Ravel is an interesting verb, in that it can mean both tangle and untangle. So if you work to ravel
yarn into a neat ball, your cat may come along and try to ravel it again.

The first syllable in ravel is accented and gets the short a sound, as in apple: RA-vle How can a
word mean both one thing and its opposite? In the case of ravel, the answer is sewing: As threads
come unwoven from a cloth, they become tangled on each other. Since untangling is never far from
tangling, ravel covers both meanings.
