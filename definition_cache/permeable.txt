Something that is permeable can be passed through, especially by liquids or gases. I wish I hadn't
worn my permeable sweater to the picnic when the weatherman called for thunderstorms. The rain
seeped right through the fabric, soaking me to the skin.

A permeable surface allows materials like liquids to pass through Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; either in or out.
Inside the body, the walls of cells are permeable membranes that allow fluids and nutrients to get
in and nourish the cells. A permeable shirt is good to wear in the summer, because it helps release
the sweat sticking to the skin.
