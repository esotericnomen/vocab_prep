To be impenitent, is to have no remorse or regrets. Try not to be impenitent about that pint of Ben
&amp; Jerry's ice cream you ate in one sitting. Everyone deserves a treat once in a while!

When you repent, you're regretting or feeling sorry about something you've done. But take its root
word penitire meaning to regret and slap the suffix im- meaning not in front of it and you've got
the opposite: impenitent, or to not regret. A murderer who is impenitent about his crime feels no
shame about what he's done.
