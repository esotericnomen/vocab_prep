Vituperation is a noun that refers to critical, abusive language. It's always a messy scene when a
political debate slips into vituperation.

Vituperation is from the Latin root words vitium, meaning a fault or defect, and parare, meaning
provide, which combined to make vituperare meaning disparage. Vituperation can also be used to refer
to feelings of bitter resentment and deep-seated antipathy toward another -- like your vituperation
toward the meter maid who just placed that ticket on your windshield.
