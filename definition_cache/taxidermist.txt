Those creepy stuffed and mounted raccoons in your grandparents' house were crafted by a taxidermist,
a person who is skilled at making lifelike displays from the bodies of dead animals.

Taxidermy is the art of preserving, arranging, and displaying animal bodies so they can be hung on
hunters' walls or set up in natural history museums. A person who practices taxidermy is called a
taxidermist. Some taxidermists are trained professionals and others do it as a hobby, preserving the
animal's skin, shaping it on a wooden or wire form, and adding specially made glass eyes.
