If you are willing to submit to someone's request, then you are compliant. Parents like it when
their teenagers are compliant and follow the rules. Teenagers, on the other hand, are probably not
as compliant as parents would like to think!

The adjective compliant can also describe something that is agreeable. The lawyers made sure that
the man's will was fully compliant with state law, so that his children could not contest his desire
to leave his entire estate to his dog, Fluffy. Or: That software is not compliant with your
operating system; you'll have to buy a different version.
