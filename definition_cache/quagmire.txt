A quagmire is a dangerous place, like the muddy shoreline of a pond. The more you try to climb out
of a quagmire, the more you seem to slip. That's because as you step on the mud, it oozes
everywhere.

Long ago, quag was a synonym for bog or marsh, a swampy area where water seems to sit instead of
drain out. Mire is another word to describe such a place. As a verb mire means stuck, like someone
who is mired in quicksand or mired in work â&euro;&rdquo; both prevent you from going anywhere. In
a quagmire, you get stuck physically â&euro;&rdquo; or, using its other meaning, in a situation
that is hard to escape because there is no easy solution.
