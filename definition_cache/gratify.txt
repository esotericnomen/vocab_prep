To gratify is to give satisfaction. So if you've managed to get straight A's in school, what you did
was gratify your parents â€” and it probably felt pretty gratifying to you too.

There's a strange taint to the word gratify. Sure, it means to do one's best to please, like the
little straight-A student that you are, but there's also a hint of indulgence about the word. How
often have you heard the phrase gratify one's desires used disapprovingly? Slightly hoggish, a bit
self-indulgent, that's gratify for you.
