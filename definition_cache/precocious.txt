That high school hoops phenom who plays like an NBA pro? The sixth grader who's already asking
questions about organic chemistry? They're both precocious â€” meaning they're way beyond their
years in skill or knowledge.

When you look at the Latin roots of precocious, it all makes sense. When pre (meaning before) joins
coquere (meaning to ripen), you have something that is ripening prematurely. And in the case of
precocious, you are usually describing young people who have some adult-like quality about them.
Maybe it's their vast vocabulary, maybe it's their ease with Calculus, or maybe it's just applying
lipstick.
