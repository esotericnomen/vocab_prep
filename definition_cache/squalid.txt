Squalid things appear neglected, or morally repulsive in nature, like a frat house after a semester
of hard partying and zero cleanup.

Squalid comes from the Latin word squalare, meaning to â&euro;&oelig;be covered with a rough, scaly
layer.â&euro;? A few word evolutions later and we have squalid, a word that describes something
distasteful, dirty, unattractive, and as unkempt in appearance as the dry, scaly skin of an
armadillo, or a room filled with pizza boxes, flickering light bulbs, and stained wallpaper. Squalid
behavior is dirty, too, like cheating on a test and lying about it.
