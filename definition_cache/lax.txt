That dad who buys beer for his teenage kids? His parenting style might be described as lax. A
paperclip chain used as a bike lock? That would be an example of lax security.

While contemplating the word lax, you may note that it's the same as the first syllable in laxative.
This is not a coincidence: lax entered English as a noun describing a substance taken or
administered to relax the bowels. Interestingly, the modern definition of lax is closer to the Latin
source word, laxus Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; an adjective meaning loose. Now, lax can refer to any phenomenon
that is insufficiently stringent or so slack as to be basically ineffectual. For example, The entire
class performed incredibly well on the test, largely due to the sleepy professor's lax supervision.
