The adjective popular describes something that is well-liked or admired by a lot of people.
Sometimes when you read a bestselling novel, you wonder why it's so popular.

Popular comes from the Latin word populus, which means people. Anything that is popular is liked by
many people. When you're talking about popular music or art, you may sometimes shorten the word
popular to pop, as in pop music or pop culture. Popular also describes things by or for the people,
or the general population, such as the popular vote or a popular revolt.
