If you are a werewolf, your animal transformation is synchronous with the lunar cycle. When
something is synchronous, it occurs in time or at the same time with something else.

In synchronous, you see syn- meaning together, and -chron- meaning time. If things such as swimming
moves are synchronous, they are said to be in sync. Jewel thieves and undercover operatives
synchronize their watches so that the team ensures synchronous actions. If the police question you
about a crime and your alibi is that you were out dancing, it means that the occurrences of the
crime and your dance were synchronous, so you could not be the perpetrator.
