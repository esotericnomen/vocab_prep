Fairness is the quality of making judgments that are free from discrimination. Judges, umpires, and
teachers should all strive to practice fairness.

Fairness comes from the Old English fĂŚger, meaning pleasing, attractive. This makes sense given
that the word is also used to describe physical beauty.  Fairness can refer to someone's good looks,
or if someone is very pale and blond, you might notice the fairness of her complexion. When someone
shows fairness is making a decision, he is pleasing all parties involved and offering a solution
that is attractive to everyone.
