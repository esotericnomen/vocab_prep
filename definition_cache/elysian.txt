The adjective elysian describes a blissful state, like the one most people hope to enjoy on a
Hawaiian vacation.

The word elysian comes from the idyllic Greek mythological place called Elysian Fields. While it
might seem at first like a place a tourist might want to see, donâ&euro;&trade;t try to book
airline tickets! Although the term is now often equated with a paradise, the Greek Elysian Fields
were a heavenly resting place to go in the  afterlife. The concept was probably originally conceived
to encourage valor in soldiers during battle. Nowadays, people tend to use elysian to describe any
heavenly scene â&euro;&rdquo; even a golf resort or a spa.
