Something that is brackish is unpleasant and harsh, like the coffee you left on too long or the
water in a muddy pond.

The adjective brackish has roots in the Dutch word brac, meaning salty, and the word is used
literally to describe water that is salty. Youâ&euro;&trade;ll often find brackish water in areas
where salty seawater mixes with freshwater, such as the brackish water of a Louisiana bayou. The
word can be used more generally, however, to describe something that is distasteful and harsh, not
just salty. When used in this way youâ&euro;&trade;ll still most likely hear the term applied to
liquids, such as a brackish tea that makes you wrinkle your nose when you taste it.
