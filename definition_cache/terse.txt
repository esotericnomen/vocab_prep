Terse means brief, or using very few words. If your teacher tells you to make your writing in your
essay style terse and to the point, he's saying use as few words as you can and be simple and clear.

A terse reply or command may seem rude or unfriendlyâ&euro;&ldquo;â&euro;&ldquo;but the word terse
itself doesn't mean unfriendly or rude. Synonyms are succinct or concise, though these words have a
more positive tone. The adjective terse is from Latin tersus clean, neat, from tergere to rub off,
wipe, polish. Polished language is neatly concise.
