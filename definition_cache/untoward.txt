The adjective untoward describes something offensive or inappropriate, like the rumors of untoward
behavior that can shatter a Hollywood icon's reputation.

Untoward also describes things that are not good for you, such as untoward advice from someone your
parents always said was a bad influence. Think about what you do when you move toward something: you
get closer to it. Suppose you're moving toward a goal. You are, as they say, on the right path. But
when you add the prefix un- you reverse that, and you're no longer on the path to that goal
Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; you're untoward.
