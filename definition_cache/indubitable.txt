Indubitable is a really fancy — five syllable, no less — way of saying utterly obvious, or clear

Indubitably is very closely related to undoubtedly, and has essentially the same meaning. But if you
want to throw in a certain educated, old-school touch to your vocabulary, go with indubitably
instead. You'll sound smarter. After all, if it was good enough for Sherlock Holmes, it's good
enough for you — Indubitably, my dear Watson... was his frequent preface to his less-quick-on-the-
uptake sidekick.
