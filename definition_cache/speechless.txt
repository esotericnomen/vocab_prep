If you’re speechless, you can’t talk, usually because something surprising and crazy happened.
You might be rendered speechless if you win the lottery or find a whale on your front lawn.

When you’re speechless, you’re at a loss for words. For example, people often say things like I
was speechless when I received the news about my brother! or The music left me speechless! It’s an
exaggeration. People use speechless in these cases to show how stunned or moved they were, even
though they were probably still capable of speech. I'm speechless often really means I'm shocked!
