If you're a lumberjack, the word hew is nothing new. You hew things every day with one swift swing
of the axe, chopping and shaping wood.

It's said that Paul Bunyan hewed the Grand Canyon by dragging his giant mythical axe behind him. But
usually things are hewn with a little more purpose Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; with each chop and cut designed
to shape, sculpt, or craft a final product. Take the axe out of the picture though, and this word
takes on a different meaning. If you're trying to adhere to rules, stick to a budget, or conform to
a certain tradition, you can use hew, too.
