If you refuse to compromise with your sister about whose turn it is to do the dishes, your mother
might accuse you both of intransigence. Intransigence is a stubborn refusal to change your views.

Inside of intransigence you see the Latin transigere which means to come to an understanding. People
who show intransigence refuse to do this. Nations are often accused of intransigence when they
refuse to comply with international standards or will.
