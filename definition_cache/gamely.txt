To do something gamely is to do it in an enthusiastic, plucky manner. If you study vocabulary in a
gamely manner (and we know you always do), you make it a point to have a great time learning new
words.

When you're game for something, you're excited and ready to do it. Likewise, to act gamely is to
have a positive, upbeat approach to something. If you gamely agree to help your friend cram for a
test, you might show up with snacks and good music Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; just to make things a little more
fun. When you behave gamely, you're bringing good vibes. A coach who runs practice in a gamely
manner is likely to inspire confidence in the team.
