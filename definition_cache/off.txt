The adverb off means away or distant. You might run off from the dinner table after an argument with
your family about what to watch on TV later.

You might dash off, moving away from where you started, or turn off your original route during a
trip. There are several other meanings of off, including not scheduled, as when you're off work, and
not running, like when you turn off your leaf blower so you won't scare your neighbor's dog. Food
can be off too, when it's gone a little bit bad or spoiled. The colloquial to off someone, or kill
them, is from 1930.
