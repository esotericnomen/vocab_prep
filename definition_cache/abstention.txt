Abstention is when someone deliberately avoids doing something, especially something that might be
harmful.

You might decide to live for a year without buying anything besides food Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; you could
call the act of doing this abstention from the consumer lifestyle. Other kinds of abstention might
include resisting junk food or quitting smoking. To abstain is to hold back or shun something. The
root of both words is the Latin abstinere, withhold, keep back, or keep off.
