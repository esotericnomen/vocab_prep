You don't want gangrene, that's for sure. It's the infection that can develop around a wound that
kills the tissue, turning it into a terrible stinking sore.

In the days before antibiotics even the smallest scratch could lead to gangrene, and doctors would
often cut off a finger or even a limb and then seal it with a red hot poker rather than risk the
infection spreading. Special surgeons known as sawbones were famed for the speed they could amputate
a limb to avoid gangrene setting in. Enough to stop you ever being nostalgic about the good old
days.
