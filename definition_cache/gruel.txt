Gruel is a truly unpleasant food â€” weak and runny, consisting of oatmeal or cornmeal boiled in
milk or water. It's the kind of slop prisoners and other inmates of institutions were historically
forced to eat.

Gruel was made most famous by Dickens's Oliver Twist, the little orphan boy in the workhouse, who
was so hungry he even asked for seconds of it: Please sir, I want some more. Gruel's reputation, not
great to begin with, never recovered. From this delightful substance comes the adjective grueling,
describing an experience that's exhausting and punishing. To get one's gruel was 1700s slang meaning
to receive one's punishment. Even back then gruel had a bad rap.
