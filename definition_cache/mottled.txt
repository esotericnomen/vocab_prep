Something that is mottled has spots or patches with different shades or colors, like the reddish
blotches that can appear on your skin if itâ€™s exposed to extreme temperatures.

Experts believe the adjective mottled comes from the noun motley, which refers to something varied
in appearance or nature, like a motley crew with its wild mix of people and styles. Mottled carries
a similar sense, in that it refers to a surface appearance characterized by varied patches of color.
If something is mottled, it has random spots or patches, like the mottled coat of a dapple gray
horse.
