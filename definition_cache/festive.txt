Festive describes an event that’s full of joy, smiles, and excitement. A birthday party without
presents, decorations, or friends would be the opposite of festive.

People having a great time — that’s a sure sign that the occasion is festive.  An awesome party,
New Year’s Eve, the last day of school, Fridays: happy times where the air feels electric,
that’s festive.  It can also describe your mood, like when you feel full of energy and ready to
dance.  Sharing the same Latin root (festivus) as the words festival and feast, festive events often
involve good food and great people.  And a piñata always helps.
