To lurk is to creep around, hide out, and wait to attack. Your teamâ€™s strategy for winning capture
the flag might be to lurk in the bushes for an hour until the opposing side thinks you gave up and
went home.

The verb lurk means to move furtively or sneak around, usually while you wait to pounce. Tigers lurk
through the jungle, stalking their prey, and creepy characters are always lurking in the shadows in
horror movies. Perhaps that's why you'll often hear people describe not-so-safe places by saying
that danger lurks at every turn.  Other words for lurk include creep, prowl, and snoop.
