Succulent means juicy and is often used to describe food. Think a succulent piece of meat, or
berries so succulent you’re left sucking juice off your fingertips when you eat them.

You can think of the word suck as hiding inside succulent––an orange you could pierce with a
straw and suck the juice out of is succulent indeed. Or remember Desert Survival 101––find a
cactus, an aloe, or another of the water-retaining plants known as succulents and drink from them.
