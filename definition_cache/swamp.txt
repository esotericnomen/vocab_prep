A swamp is an area that floods every year because the land is low. Watch out for alligators if you
visit  Atchafalaya National Wildlife Refuge in Louisiana, the largest swamp in the United States.

Anyone who has spent time in a busy restaurant kitchen has heard harried chefs cry, I'm in the
weeds! Such people are in a different kind of swamp â&euro;&rdquo; the challenging environment in
which too many things need to be done in too short a time. Another way of saying this is, I'm
swamped. Here swamp is a verb that describes being stuck in a seemingly endless situation
â&euro;&rdquo; you feel like you're stuck in the squishy mud of a real swamp.
