If you obsess about your health and imagine you have the symptoms of a disease (or diseases), you
may well be a hypochondriac and should seek therapy.

The original Greek hypochondriakos referred to the region of the abdomen, an area that ancient
doctors believed to be the seat of misery or melancholia. It stands to reason, then, that
hypochondriacs are usually unhappy, simply because they always imagine they're sick.
