A vulture is a type of bird — with a bald head and neck — that feeds on dead animals.

One of the most fearsome birds is the vulture: this bird of prey feeds on almost nothing but dead
flesh. Unlike other animals that hunt, vultures go after animals that were killed by other animals
or died naturally. Vultures are scavengers looking for corpses. And because of their morbid tastes,
vultures are often associated with horror movies and scenes of carnage.
