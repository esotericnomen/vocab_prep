A noble is a titled peer of the realm or an aristocrat. As an adjective, noble describes someone
with high or elevated character, or who is impressive in appearance.

From feudal times, we have known nobles as the heirs to thrones or as the holders of aristocratic
title. British aristocracy, for example, produces many people of various noble titles, including
dukes, earls, princes, kings, and queens. As various royal histories tell us, however, many of these
nobles in title weren't quite so noble in character.
