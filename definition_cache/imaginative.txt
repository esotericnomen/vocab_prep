To be imaginative is to be inventive and original. If you enjoy coming up with stories, writing
songs, or just thinking about things in new ways, you’re an imaginative person.

Great painters, musicians, and writers are imaginative.  However, being imaginative isn’t just
limited to the arts. When you're imaginative, you can develop a unique solution to a problem or
issue. For example, an imaginative engineer might develop a new, more efficient way to construct a
bridge. An idea or object that’s fresh and original — like that bridge the engineer designed —
can also be described as imaginative.
