If everyone at the lunch meeting is vying for the last roast beef sandwich, but you grab it first,
you preempt your colleagues from getting it. Let them eat liverwurst. Preempt means to displace or
take something before others can.

Preempt combines the Latin prefix prae- before with emere to buy. Think old-fashioned land grabs,
midnight madness sales, and seating at concerts. It can also mean to replace one thing with another
that√¢&euro;&trade;s more important. For instance, if the president is speaking or the football game
is running long, brace yourself; the network just might preempt your favorite show.
