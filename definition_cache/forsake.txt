To forsake another person is to leave them entirely, usually in a moment of need.

Forsake may mean simply giving something up, such as a way of life or a homeland, for something
better or more appropriate. But it is often a mean word, suggesting leaving something or someone
behind when they need you to stay. One way to remember the meaning of this verb â&euro;&rdquo; to
abandon or desert â&euro;&rdquo; is to remember this little sentence: For heaven's sake, don't
leave me, or heaven is lost! Lose the heaven, and you have forsake.
