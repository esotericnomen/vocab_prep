When you allude to something, you don't identify it or mention it specifically. If you allude to the
fact that a cop is sitting right behind you, your friends might stop talking about their plans to
rob a bank.

Allude is from Latin allūdere to play with, joke from the prefix ad- toward plus lūdere to play.
The corresponding noun is allusion, which is often used of an indirect reference in literature:
Helen, a fitting name for a woman of great beauty, is an allusion to Helen of Troy.
