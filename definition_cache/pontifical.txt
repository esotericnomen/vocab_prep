If you ever listen to talk radio you'll hear some fairly pontifical talk going on â€” that is,
puffed up, vain, overblown speech from someone convinced he alone is right. What he's doing is
pontificating.

Pontifical also has a strictly religious meaning, in the sense of anything related to the Pope since
the Pope is also known as the Pontiff, or supreme head of the Roman Catholic church. Because
Catholic doctrine regards the Pope as being incapable of being wrong, his pontifical utterances are
therefore deemed quite infallible.
