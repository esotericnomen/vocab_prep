A chasm is a deep divide, either literal or figurative, such as a giant chasm in an ice cap or the
growing chasm between two friends who haven't spoken in a long time.

The first syllable in chasm sounds like cat without the t sound: CA-zum. It comes from the Greek
word khasma, meaning yawning hollow, gulf and was originally used to describe a split in a land
formation, such as a deep crack caused by an earthquake. The word still retains that sense, but
today can also mean a profound division between people or beliefs, such as a chasm between
Republicans and Democrats.
