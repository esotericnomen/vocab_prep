A shudder is an involuntary vibration, usually in your body, or the shaking itself. A cold breeze or
an unpleasant memory might make you shudder.

A shudder isn't always a bad thing. It can mean a pleasurable sensation or tingle that goes through
your body, like a shudder of excitement you feel when you see your favorite star on the street. As a
verb, shudder means to shake and shiver. Being really cold or seeing something that scares you
â&euro;&rdquo; a ghost! â&euro;&rdquo; can make you shudder. The phrase shudder to think means
just the thought of something upsets you enough to shudder.
