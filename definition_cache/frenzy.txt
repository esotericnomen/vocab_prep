In a frenzy, people go into a state of hysteria. Stay away from hungry sharks or kids at a 16th
birthday party when the pizza arrives if you don't want to get caught up in a feeding frenzy.

Frenzy is derived from the Latin word phreneticus meaning delirious. If you're in a frenzy, you're
certainly delirious. You can be in a frenzy because something made you mad, happy, or even just
hungry Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; whatever makes you so crazy you're not thinking clearly. Frenzy is often used
when talking about a group of people (or animals) who get worked up at the same time about the same
thing, like sharks near tasty fish or teenagers near pizza.
