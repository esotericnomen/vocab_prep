To gild something is to cover it with gold. You gild an object in order to decorate it — or just
to show off your wealth.

From forks to picture frames, gilding can make objects seem ritzy, glamorous, and more valuable.
However, some things in life just don’t need a coat of gold. If someone says you are “gilding
the lily,” they mean that you are trying to improve on something that is already perfect.
