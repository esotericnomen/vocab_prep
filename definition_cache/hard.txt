Hard is the opposite of easy. If you're just beginning an exercise routine, don't push yourself too
hard in the beginning, to avoid injury.

Hard can mean difficult, but it can also mean rigid. A hard surface is one that doesn’t give way,
like stone. If things are tough for you, you might tell someone you’re having a hard day. If
someone gives you hard liquor, watch out — that’s the strong stuff. If you’re a teacher, you
want to make your examinations hard enough to be challenging, but not impossible. If you’re
stubborn, people might call you hardheaded.
