Deception is a trick or scheme used to get what you want, like the deception you used to get your
sister to agree to do all your chores for a month.

Deception occurs when you deceive, a word that comes from the Latin de- meaning from and capere,
meaning to take. When you deceive someone, the result may be taking -- like items you don't really
need from people willing to give them, believing they are helping you. You may have heard the phrase
take someone for a ride. That's a way of describing deception.
