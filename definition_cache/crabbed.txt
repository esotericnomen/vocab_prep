If your friend fell out of bed, spilled hot tea on his socks, and tripped in the snow, you might
expect him to be crabbed. Crabbed describes someone who is grumpy, or irritable, or has a generally
crotchety attitude.

The word crabbed originally meant “resembling a crab” and also takes part of its meaning from
the sour-tasting crab apple. You can think of crabbed as describing what someone would be like if
they were made into a crab. The word is used less often than its synonym crabby, but the meaning of
crabbed is just as easy to understand: if you were covered in sand all day, you’d probably feel
crabbed too!
