Pity the poor peon. He exists at the very bottom of the food chain of servitude, beneath wage-
slaves, underlings, drudges, or even minions. His boss doesn't even know he exists.

Peon was a Mexican word originally, meaning an agricultural worker in servitude to his landlord.
Today, peon has a more comic ring to it and is usually used in fun Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; though if you are
a personal assistant to a tyrannical Hollywood star, for example, it's probably no laughing matter.
