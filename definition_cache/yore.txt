If you know someone who dreams of a time long ago, when knights roamed the countryside and engaged
in daring and romantic quests, you could say that person longs for “days of yore.”

Yore, meaning a time long ago, is used in the same manner as yesteryear, days gone by, and olden
times. Yore has a sentimental or nostalgic tone to it, implying that the olden times being described
are in some way superior to the present day. You might hear someone say, “This tragedy wouldn’t
have happened in days of yore,” or “The car designs of yore were more imaginative than anything
being built today.”
