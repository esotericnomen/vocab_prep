Something so unusual that it must be from some unfamiliar place is exotic. An exotic pet might be a
panda, instead of a hamster. An exotic trip might be a journey to the Galapagos Islands, instead of
to Orlando's Sea World.

Animals and people, or sensory things like food and smells, are often called exotic when they are
from far-away lands. In the 16th century, exotic came into use Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; from Latin and Greek
words for foreign, which came, in turn, from exo-, meaning outside. By the 17th century it was also
being used to describe things that are striking or unusual. Even when the words strange and alien
are sometimes used as synonyms.
