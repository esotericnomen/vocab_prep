Gothic novels, horror movies, and crime dramas don't shy away from showing gruesome scenes of death,
pictures that inspire fright and repulsion. Synonyms include ghastly, grisly, loathsome, and
macabre.

Once upon a time, English contained a variety of words related to gruesome. The verb grue  meant to
shudder, just as its Middle Dutch source gruwen did. Grueful and grueing also conveyed the sense of
shivering with horror and disgust. All of these variations have been lost leaving us only with
gruesome. Texting while driving has caused many gruesome accidents that you might not want to hear
the gruesome details of. Although if you like gruesome movies, you might want to know.
