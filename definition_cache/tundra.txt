The tundra is a vast treeless plain near the Arctic Circle where the subsoil is permanently frozen.
Despite the stark cold, many animals thrive on the tundra, including insects, migrating birds, and
foxes.

A tundra is a great description of any stark icy cold place â&euro;&rdquo; say, the walk to class
on a college campus during February â&euro;&rdquo; but it is an actual geographic location, near
the Arctic circle in North America, Russia, and Scandinavia. Smaller tundras can exist near the
South Pole but it's often too cold there. The word comes from the Finnish tunturria which means
barren land. Santa's reindeer live on the tundra and go by the name of caribou in North America. Of
course, none of them can fly.
