Dishonor is a state of shame and disgrace. If you were caught lip-syncing to a recording during a
singing contest, you’d probably feel a sense of dishonor.

Honor has to do with respect, so dishonor involves a lack of respect. If you dishonor something,
you’ve brought shame to it. Athletes who cheat during a game have dishonored themselves and their
teams. You can also say a shameful act brings dishonor. When a politician is involved in a scandal,
it brings dishonor to his or her reputation.
