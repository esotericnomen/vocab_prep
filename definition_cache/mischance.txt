Mischance describes a moment of bad luck, like when you have the mischance of slipping on the ice or
catching a cold or losing your car keys.

A mischance is a mishap or misadventure, or it can be plain old bad luck, like being in the wrong
place at the wrong time. The word comes from an Old French word, mescheoir, where mes-, means
adversely and -cheoir means befall. A series of mischances might add up to a failed business, a lost
Super Bowl, or just a really, really bad day.
