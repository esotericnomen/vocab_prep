Watch out when a situation becomes volatile â€” it is likely to change for the worse suddenly. You
fight and then make up with your partner often if you two have a volatile relationship.

Volatile from Latin volatilis fleeting, transitory always gives the sense of sudden, radical change.
Think of it as the opposite of stable. A person who is volatile loses his or her temper suddenly and
violently. A volatile political situation could erupt into civil war. When the stock market is
volatile, it fluctuates greatly.  And in scientific language, a volatile oil evaporates quickly.
