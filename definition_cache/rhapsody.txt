A rhapsody is an impassioned speech or sentiment. Your rhapsody about the desserts at your city's
new restaurant has all of your friends drooling and dying to try them.

A rhapsody is also part of an epic poem that is suitable for reciting. The word comes from the Greek
word rhapsodios, which means a person who recites epic poems, and whose root is rhaptein, meaning to
stitch. A rhapsody is also a musical piece noted for its improvisational nature and irregular form.
Perhaps the most famous of this type of music is George Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue, composed in
1924.
