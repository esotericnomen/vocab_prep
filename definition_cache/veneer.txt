You know how some furniture looks like solid oak or maple until it gets chipped and reveals itself
to be nothing more than some cheap particle-board covered with a thin layer of fancy wood?  That
thin layer is called a veneer.

A veneer can be anything that makes something look more elegant or attractive than it is. Originally
it was a furniture word, but over time its meaning expanded.  If someone smiles at you while making
some passive-aggressive remark, like, Gee, you actually look really nice today, you could say that
her inner meanness is showing through her veneer of sweetness.
