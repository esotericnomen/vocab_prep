When you macerate something, you soften it by soaking it in a liquid, often while you're cooking or
preparing food.

To macerate strawberries, all you have to do is sprinkle sugar on them, which draws out their juices
so they become soft and sweet and deliciously saucy. Macerate is sometimes also used to mean cause
to grow thin or weak, or in other words, to make someone feel like a soft, squishy strawberry.
