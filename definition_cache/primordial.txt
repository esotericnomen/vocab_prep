Primordial, an adjective, describes something that has been around forever, like cockroaches.

Primordial comes the Latin words primus, meaning first and ordiri, to begin. So it is easy to see
that this adjective means first of all, original. When something is primordial, it has existed since
the earliest time, like the primordial mud some scientists believe was the source of all life on
Earth. Remember that is it a scientific term Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; don't call your teacher primordial just
because she's been teaching at your school since it opened.
