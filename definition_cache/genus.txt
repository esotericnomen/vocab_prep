A genus is a class or group of something. In biology, it's a taxonomic group covering more than one
species.

This is a term used by biologists to classify more than one species under a larger umbrella. In
biology, the word family describes the broadest group category, then genus, and then species. For
example, primates are a family, and humans are a species within that family, but we're not in the
same genus as macaques: macaques have their own genus. Dogs and wolves are so closely related
they√¢&euro;&trade;re in the same genus. The plural of genus is genera.
