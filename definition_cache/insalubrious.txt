Insalubrious is a formal way to say something is bad for your health. Whether it’s the smog in the
city, the atmosphere at your workplace, or a load of coal tar — they all sound insalubrious.

The word insalubrious came into English in the seventeenth century from the Latin word insalubris, a
combination of in-, meaning not, and salubris, meaning healthful. That makes for a decidedly
unhealthy combination, and the word even has a slightly disreputable sound to it, like you’ve been
out doing something you shouldn’t be doing. But at the same time it’s slightly formal, in part
because it’s somewhat unusual in modern usage. Use it as a fancy way to describe something
unhealthy that’s also a little bit common — like Las Vegas or fried chicken.
