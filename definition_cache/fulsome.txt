Compliments usually make you feel pretty good, but fulsome compliments, which are exaggerated and
usually insincere, may have the opposite effect.

Hundreds of years ago fulsome used to mean abundant, but now it's more often used to describe an
ingratiating manner or an excess of flattery that might provoke an onlooker to mime gagging. If you
find fulsome to be a rather clunky word, there are several fun (if vaguely stomach-churning)
synonyms, including buttery, oily, oleaginous, and smarmy.
