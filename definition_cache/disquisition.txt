Disquisition is a long and elaborate word to describe a long and elaborate analysis of a given
topic. If you launch into a disquisition about toe jam at a party, you'll soon be talking to a wall.

If you write a paper that looks at every single aspect of a topic, that essay can be called a
disquisition. If you have a strong interest in something, chances are your friends and family have
heard you give passionate disquisitions on it. A disquisition is an incredibly thorough reporting on
a topic. Think if it as a discourse or a discussion of an inquisition or long investigation.
