Your opinion is your view, belief, or judgment. If you are opinionated, you obstinately hold on to
your opinions, and you don't hesitate to let other people know what those opinions are.

Opinionated is based on the word opinion, which itself comes from the Latin word opinari, meaning to
think. If you and your sister are both extremely opinionated, it must have been hard growing up in
the same house Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; for you and for your parents. Someone who is not at all opinionated
can be just as frustrating to live with, though, if their response always seems to be, I don't care.
