Homely describes someone who's plain or unattractive, like your homely Aunt Agnes or her squish-
faced bulldog.

The adjective homely is a slightly more gentle word than ugly, with a meaning closer to plain than
hideous. It's almost always used to describe a less-than-attractive person, and occasionally an
animal. If you were British, you'd use homely to mean cozy and homelike, but in the United States
you'd say homey. Be careful not to confuse homey with homely, or you could accidentally hurt
someone's feelings.
