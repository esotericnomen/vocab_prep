A nonconformist is someone who doesn’t conform to other people’s ideas of how things should be.
Activists, artists, street performers, your wacky uncle Marvin — anyone who marches to the beat of
a different drummer is a nonconformist.

Nonconformist is one of those words that has both a noun and an adjective form. The noun describes
someone who acts apart from the masses, and the adjective describes people or other things that have
those same nonconformist qualities. If your actions mark you as a nonconformist, chances are you'll
take a nonconformist approach when it comes to planning your next vacation.
