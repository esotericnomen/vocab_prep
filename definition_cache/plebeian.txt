In Roman times, the lower class of people was the plebeian class. Today, if something is plebeian,
it is of the common people.

When you hear the word plebeian used to describe a form of art or taste, it means that while
something is liked by a lot of people, it may not be of the highest quality or taste. Both soap
operas and reality television shows have been described as plebeian forms of entertainment. A member
of the plebeian class is known as a pleb, which is pronounced pleeb.
