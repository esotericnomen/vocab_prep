You can use maudlin to describe something that brings tears to your eyes, or makes you feel very
emotional. Tearjerkers like Forrest Gump and Titanic can be described as maudlin.

Maudlin was a form of the name Mary Magdalene, a character from the Bible represented in paintings
as a weeping sinner asking forgiveness from Jesus. Maudlin is often paired with sentimental, or even
schlocky, to describe cry-fests, as in I can't watch another second of that overly-sentimental,
maudlin soap opera. Turn that schlock off.
