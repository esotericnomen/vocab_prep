If you have an office job, it means that you go to work in an office, or a professional business
place, every day.

Your office is the place you work, meeting with colleagues, sitting at a desk, and wearing sneakers
on Casual Friday. The President of the United States has an office too, but it's a different kind:
his or her office is a position of power. All government officials can be described as holding or
taking office, which is when they assume the control and responsibilities that come with their
important jobs.
