When you're at a lecture and you feel restless, you've got to sublimate the desire to move around.
That means you force the desire to be more subtle so you can continue listening — even if you
don't want to.

Psychologists use the verb sublimate to describe the process of channeling intense energy into
something useful or appropriate. Freud sublimated his desire to live at home with his mother, and he
moved into his own apartment. Sublimate is related to the word sublime — both words come from the
Latin word sublimare, which means to raise up or to exalt. So Freud's finally getting his own place
is, arguably, a superior — a more exalted — living situation.
