Obscene describes something that is morally offensive in a sexual way. If you pick up the phone and
hear heavy breathing, you're the recipient of an obscene phone call.

Certain films, books, magazines, and other forms of entertainment are considered obscene because
they portray sex in a very frank way that some people find vulgar and lewd. Obscene material is
considered taboo in polite society. Obscene can also be used to describe something repulsive -- like
when your friend ate an obscene number of snails at the Bastille Day bash.
