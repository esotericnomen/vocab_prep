A tenant is someone who lives in a place owned by someone else, usually paying rent. If you play
your music loud and let the cat pee in the corner, your landlord will not think that you're a very
good tenant.

Tenant is often used to mean renter, but it can mean anyone who has the right to live in a
particular place, either because he signed a lease, which is a rental agreement, because he owns the
land, or because government gave him a title to it. If you live in a big apartment building, you
should be aware of your rights as a tenant, which usually include things like having heat in the
winter and proper fire escapes.
