A word that comes up a lot in discussions of both food and people pairings, compatible speaks to a
person or thing’s ability to exist agreeably with something or someone else.

Use the word compatible to describe two things that work well together, like your Wii and your big
screen TV, or peanut butter and jelly. You may have heard that opposites attract, but initial
attraction doesn’t necessarily mean that opposites will be compatible in the long-term. Advised
Russian novelist and philosopher Leo Tolstoy, “What counts in making a happy marriage is not so
much how compatible you are, but how you deal with incompatibility.”
