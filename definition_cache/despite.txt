Despite is used as a preposition when something happens even though it might have been prevented by
something else. You might go see a movie despite hearing a review calling it worse than Showgirls
and Ishtar combined.

Despite is just one letter away from despise, and they actually share a root: the Latin verb
despicere, meaning to look down on scornfully. Despite came to mean contempt or scorn in English,
though that use as a noun has mostly dropped out of use. The phrase in despite of gradually got
shortened to the preposition despite and lost its scornful quality. If you accomplish something
despite the obstacles in your way, there's no need to feel spiteful about it.
