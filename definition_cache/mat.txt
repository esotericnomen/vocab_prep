When you walk into someone else's house, it's polite to wipe your feet on the mat â€” the pad that
covers part of the floor inside the front door.

A mat is a kind of floor covering, often smaller than a rug or carpet. You might buy a sea grass mat
to put in your bedroom, or a door mat for your apartment entryway. You can also use the word mat as
a verb, to mean tangle or snarl: The dog managed to mat the fur on his belly by rolling around on
the beach. The Old English matte came from the Latin word matta, mat made of rushes.
