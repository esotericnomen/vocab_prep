When you take an oath about something, you swear to it, affirming its truth. Ironically, if you
utter an oath, such as a curse word or obscenity, you also swear.  Do you swear to put a quarter in
this jar for every time you swear?

The two separate meanings of swear come from branches of the same etymological tree. Both meanings
have ties to Old Norse sverja, but sometime in the Middle English, the word became on one hand
sweren with the meaning to promise, while another version, swerian, became to curse. Both might come
from the idea of an oath being connected to a deity, but while one referred to truth, the other went
to the dark side, negatively invoking a sacred name.
