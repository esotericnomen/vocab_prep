Some people claim to have premonitions, such as a dream about a friend they haven't seen in years
the night before the friend dies. A premonition is a warning that comes in advance, or a feeling
that something is going to happen.

Like the synonym foreboding, a premonition usually refers to something bad or harmful. This noun is
from Middle French premonicion, from Late Latin praemonitio, from Latin praemonere to warn in
advance, from the prefix prae- before plus monere to warn.
