Scientists believe that one of the causes of the obesity epidemic sweeping the US is our sedentary
lifestyle. Sedentary means sitting a lot and refers to a person or job that is not very physically
active.

This adjective has a specialized meaning when referring to certain types of birds that stay in one
area and do not migrate. Sedentary is from French sédentaire, from Old French, from Latin
sedentārius, from sedēre to sit.
