A teacher who shows a clear preference for a particular student might be accused of favoritism, or
favoring one person over others.

The noun favoritism can simply describe the habit of preferring one particular person or group of
people, but it often implies that it's done at the expense of other people. Your grandmother
practices favoritism if she clearly likes one of her grandchildren best, and a politician is guilty
of favoritism if she gives tax breaks to one group but not to others. The word favorite is at the
root of favoritism, from the Latin root favere, to show kindness to.
