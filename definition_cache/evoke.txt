The verb evoke most commonly means to bring a feeling, memory, or picture into the mind. When you
visit your old elementary school, the smells, sounds, and colors there can evoke memories from the
past.

Similarly, a certain reaction can be evoked by words or actions, as in His comments evoked anger in
the community. A near synonym is elicit, as in No matter how many different ways the detective
questioned the suspect, he could not elicit any response. Evoke was borrowed from Latin evocare,
from the prefix e- out, plus vocare to call.
