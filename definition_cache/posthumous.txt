If something happens after someone dies, it is described as posthumous — like the posthumous
interest in the music of a singer who died a nobody.

The adjective posthumous comes from Latin — post means after and humare, to bury. (You might also
think of humus, which means dirt or earth.) So something that is posthumous happens after a person
is dead, like the posthumous discovery that your humble neighbor who lived very modestly was
actually a multi-millionaire, or the posthumous publication of a book that the writer finished just
before she died.
