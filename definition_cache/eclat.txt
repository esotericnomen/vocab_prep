When you do something with eclat, you do it with great style or an amazing effect. A skilled
magician performs all of her tricks with eclat.

Eclat is the gusto or flair with which you make an entrance at a party or sing a song at your school
talent show. It's also a certain measure of success, especially the type that other people consider
you to have -- your skill on the soccer field might lend you a certain amount of eclat among your
classmates, for example. The word eclat comes from the French ĂŠclat, which means splinter or
fragment, but also flash of brilliance.
