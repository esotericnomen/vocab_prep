Unrequited is used almost exclusively in the context of romantic love. If you love someone and they
don't love you back––that, my friend, is a case of unrequited love.

Unrequited love is so painful, most people feel they are the first person in history to experience
it, but the word unrequited has in fact been around since the 1520s, when it was invented, like many
good words, to talk about money. It derived from re- 'back' + the Middle English quite 'pay up.'
