What do Santa Claus, Bigfoot, and unicorns have in common?  Aside from the fact that they’re
completely real, they’re also hirsute: very, very hairy creatures.

All mammals have hair, but the ones that have way more than others, you might call them hirsute.
There are hirsute people, like lumberjacks with a jungle of chest hair, bearded ladies at a circus,
or just someone with a scraggly hairdo.  The word is pronounced “HER-suit,” so if you see a
woman wearing a furry jacket with matching pants, you could say, “Her suit is hirsute.”  Just
make sure it’s actually a suit and not her real hair.
