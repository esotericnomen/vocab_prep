The adjective offhand describes a remark or comment that is made without previous thought or
preparation. If you are at a wedding, you may want to make a few offhand but nice remarks about the
bride and groom.

As an adjective, offhand can mean careless, brusque, or inconsiderate. You may frequently have to
remind young children that offhand comments about people's looks or intelligence can hurt their
feelings. Offhand can also be used as an adverb, meaning without thought or planning. You may not be
able to say offhand, but do you have any idea how many people are in your class at school?
