A maverick is a rebel, someone who shows a lot of independence. A maverick on a motorcycle might
blaze his own trail, or show a maverick touch in a rough sport by wearing a helmet with the word Mom
inside a heart.

Samuel A. Maverick owned a lot of cattle, and he let them roam around Texas without a brand, or
identification mark, seared into their skins. Samuel was a maverick for going against the common
practice of tracking his animals, and his last name became part of the English language as both an
adjective and a noun in the 19th century. Someone who acts very independently is a maverick, and
individual actions that stand out are maverick, as in her maverick jumping style on the ice was both
wild and delicate.
