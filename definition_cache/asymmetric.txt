You describe something as asymmetric when it lacks the mirror-image quality of symmetry. That dress
your sister sewed for you may appear stylishly asymmetric, but really the reason the sleeves are
different lengths is because she doesnâ€™t know how to use a tape measure.

The a- prefix comes from Latin and makes a word into its opposite, so asymmetric is the opposite of
symmetric. Asymmetric often describes an intentional part of a design, like a shirt with an
asymmetric neckline. But it can also describe something that is the result of a mistake, injustice,
or deformity, like asymmetric growth in a body, which may be a sign of disease.
