Requisition is a very official-sounding word that usually means to take or seize.  We're sorry that
your luxury suite has been requisitioned by the mayor's office.  No, we have no idea what he's doing
in there.

Requisition looks a little like request and, in fact, it comes from the Old French word meaning
exactly that.  It can still be used that way, like when you make a requisition for a new office desk
because the old one has three broken drawers.  If a police officer requisitions your car for use in
a high speed chase, it will initially require less paperwork.
