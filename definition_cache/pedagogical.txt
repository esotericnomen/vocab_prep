Anything that relates to teaching is pedagogical. If your teacher has pedagogical dreams all night
long, even in sleep, his mind is in the classroom.

The adjective pedagogical, pronounced peh-duh-GAH-gi-cal, comes from the Greek word paidagōgikos
meaning “teacher.” If it's pedagogical, it concerns teaching, from lesson plans to approaches to
teaching, even how the classroom looks — in rooms where the teacher's pedagogical philosophy is
that students learn better when they work collaboratively, desks may be pushed together so four
students can sit in their groups.
