Use the verb persevere when you want to persist in anything and continue despite difficulties or
obstacles.

The verb persevere comes from the Latin root persevereus which means continue steadfastly, persist
and that word comes from two others, per- for very and severus for strict. So, today, the
connotation of the word is to persist in a methodical way despite obstacles or distractions. You can
see the relationship between persevere and perseverate, which means to persistently repeat
something, and that word is a medical term used to describe stuttering.
