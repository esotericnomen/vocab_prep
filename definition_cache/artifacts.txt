An artifact is a man-made object that has some kind of cultural significance. If you find a 12th
century vase, it's an artifact of that time. Don't drop it!

Artifact is a combination of two Latin words, arte, meaning by skill and factum which means to make.
Usually when you use the word artifact, you are describing something crafted that was used for a
particular purpose during a much earlier time.
