Anything that needs to be mailed, sent off, or quickly shipped needs to be dispatched. Letters,
official reports, teams of police — if it has somewhere to be, you can dispatch it to get there.

Sometimes spelled despatch, this word was first used in the early 1500s as a verb meaning “to send
off in a hurry.” These days we get hurried dispatches in noun and verb form, from journalists
sending in their war zone stories to emergency squads getting dispatched to the scene of an
accident. And in its most sinister sense, dispatch means to kill off without delay.
