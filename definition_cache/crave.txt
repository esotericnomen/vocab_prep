To crave something is to have a great desire for it, as one might crave love, fame, or French fries.

Crave is typically used in the context of emotional or physical desires rather than practical needs.
For example, most people crave a hug or a cup of hot cocoa every now and then, but it’s unusual to
crave a new filing cabinet or tie rack — although if that’s how you feel, don’t let us
interfere. Interestingly, crave comes from an Old English word meaning “demand.” Perhaps our
ancestors were more assertive about getting what they wanted.
