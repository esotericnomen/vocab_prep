When you carve a statue from a block of marble, you use a tool called a chisel to cut out the shape.
Chisel is the name of the tool and also the name of the action.

A chisel has a flat, sharp end. To carve using a chisel, you hit the back of it with a hammer or
another blunt instrument. Chisel can also mean to cheat. If someone chisels you out of your
allowance, they shaved it away from you bit by bit.
