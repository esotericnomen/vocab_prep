A beautiful sunset, a rainbow, a wonderful dream right before your alarm clock goes off — all of
these could be described as evanescent, which means “fleeting” or “temporary.”

Evanescent comes from the Latin ex, meaning out of, and vanescere, meaning to vanish. When
pronouncing this word, emphasize the third syllable and note that the c is silent. You might want to
practice saying evanescent a few times right now; if you stumble over pronunciation when you need
this word the most, whatever you’re describing — be it a shooting star or a whiff of fragrant
perfume — will be gone.
