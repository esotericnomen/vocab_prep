A raisin is a dehydrated or sun-dried grape. Raisins are sweet and chewy, and they're often found in
oatmeal cookies and granola.

Raisins are one of the most common kind of dried fruit Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; they turn up everywhere from
a preschooler's snack box to a fancy bakery's scones and cinnamon rolls. The most common way to make
a raisin is to dry grapes in the sun, though it's quicker for producers to use dehydrating machines.
The word raisin dates to the thirteenth century, from the Latin racemus, which means cluster of
grapes or berries.
