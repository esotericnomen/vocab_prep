Use the adjective inarticulate to describe poor communication skills, like at your most inarticulate
moments when you nervously fumble to find the right word and completely forget to make your most
important point.

Inarticulate sounds — a grunt, cry, scream, snort, wail, howl, moan, sob, snicker — are heard
but not easily understood. If something is inarticulate, it is hard to get the meaning, like an
inarticulate speech whose main idea can't be found. Creative works can also be inarticulate, when it
isn't clear what — if anything — they are trying to express, like a painter whose gallery show
that is called inarticulate by a critic: You can't grasp what the artist is trying to say.
