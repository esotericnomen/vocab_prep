Pied means colorfully jumbled. If you're looking at kittens, you may see solid black ones, solid
white, or ones with lots of different patches of color. You'd call a patchy one pied.

Pied was first used to refer to magpies√¢&euro;&trade; black and white plumage. Later, pied came to
refer to an order of friars known for their black and white robes, and even later, pied came to
refer to a jumble of typefaces in a printed document. Now, pied can indicate anything having two or
more colors. Someone with multicolored articles of clothing can be said to be pied, as in the Pied
Piper of Hamlin.
