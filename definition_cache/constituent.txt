Constituent means part of a whole, as in we'll break this down into its constituent parts. The word
comes up often in political contexts: constituents are the people politicians have been elected to
represent.

To understand constituent, look at constitute, which means to make up. A politician's electorate is
constituted of individual constituent voters. Chex Party Mix is constituted of a delightful mix of
constituent parts: Chex cereal, pretzels, cheese doodles and those little orange stick things no one
has a name for.
