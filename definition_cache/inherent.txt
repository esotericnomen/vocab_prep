Use the adjective inherent for qualities that are considered permanent or cannot be separated from
an essential character.

We use the adjective inherent to describe attributes that are part of the essential nature of
something. It's different from you being tall, rather than being a description, it has to be a
quality and this quality is unchangeable. So, for example, if you have never been able to eat
spinach, you have an inherent dislike of it.
