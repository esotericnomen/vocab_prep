A spartan existence is kind of like being a monk. Your room is bare, you live simply and eat
sparingly, and your sheets are probably scratchy.

In ancient Greece, there were two great city states: Athens and Sparta. Athens had the artists, the
good food, the great parties. Sparta had the warriors â&euro;&rdquo; the guys who went to bed early
and drilled all day. They lived in bare rooms and didnâ&euro;&trade;t get sick days or time off. A
spartan life is a life of discipline and self-denial. Some people like it like that. Go figure.
