To nonplus is to baffle or confuse someone to the point that they have nothing to say. Something
weird and mysterious can nonplus you, like a play that is performed entirely by chickens.

If you know a little French or Latin, you'll recognize that non plus means no more. When something
bewildering nonpluses you, there's no more you can say or do about it. A goal of getting poor
grades, running with a bad crowd, and refusing to eat would leave your parents nonplussed. Sometimes
people misuse nonplus to mean unimpressed, but that's not correct: to nonplus is to puzzle, confuse,
and dumbfound.
