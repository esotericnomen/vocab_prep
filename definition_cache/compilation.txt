A compilation is a collection. You might have enough fascinating stories about compasses to publish
your own compilation of the best. You'd have to find some other compass enthusiasts to buy it
though.

Coming from the 15th century Latin compilationem “that which is compiled,” a compilation is a
grouping or anthology of similar items. A music compilation brings together different artists and
songs on a playlist. One can gather essays on a similar topic to organize a compilation for a book.
And as President Franklin D. Roosevelt noted, the Constitution itself is the most marvelously
elastic compilation of rules of government ever written.”
