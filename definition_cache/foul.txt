Foul is most commonly used as an adjective to describe a bad smell. As a verb, foul usually means
“make dirty or messy.” You might foul your room to the point where it smells a bit foul.

In general, foul can be used as an adjective meaning bad. Foul luck is bad luck; a foul day is a bad
day. As a verb, foul can mean break the rules. It’s used this way in sports, like when you commit
a foul on the basketball court. The phrase foul play can be used in the context of sports or more
generally, to indicate unfair or violent behavior. Avoid confusing foul with fowl, which refers to
birds, especially chickens.
