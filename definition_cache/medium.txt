Think of the word medium as something in between. In clothing, we have small, medium, and large; in
communications, it's what signals travel through from broadcast to receiver; and in spiritual terms,
it’s a person who converses with the dead.

The word medium — from the Latin adjective medius, middle — has several meanings that all center
on the idea of being in between. From the air that carries the broadcast signal, to the person who
transmits messages from the dead, to the measurement of the doneness of your steak, medium means
something that lies between two other points, people, or levels.
