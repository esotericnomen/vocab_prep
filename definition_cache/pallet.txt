Pallet is a busy noun, but itâ€™s mainly a slab or framework of wood used for carrying things. The
most common type of pallet is the kind used to move cargo.

After the earthquake in Haiti, hundreds of pallets of food, medicine, and bottles of fresh water
were delivered to Port-au-Prince by air. Many pallets are designed with slots at the bottom to
accept a forklift's forks. If you're a talented carpenter, you might be able to turn the wood from a
used pallet into a table, a chest of drawers, a tree house, or perhaps a little bed to lie down on
after all that hard work.
