Suavity is the art of making people like and want to be around you, like the celebrity whose suavity
helped him land great movie roles â€” even though he wasn't the most talented actor to audition.

Suavity, pronounced SWAH-vuh-tee, depends on saying all the right things to get in good with
everyone around. So, though it is a graceful and often helpful thing to have suavity, it also might
be a little less than real: In avoiding any topic that might get the conversation moving in a more
lively and even heated direction, those who possess great suavity may also make things a little
boring, fake, even. Talking about the weather and where everyone went on vacation does get a bit
old.
