To meander means to wander aimlessly on a winding roundabout course. If you want some time to
yourself after school, you might meander home taking the time to window shop and look around.

Meander comes from a river in modern-day Turkey, the Maiandros, which winds and wanders on its
course. Today, a stream or a path meanders, as does a person who walks somewhere in a roundabout
fashion. If your speech meanders, you don't keep to the point. It's hard to understand what your
teacher is trying to impart if he keeps meandering off with anecdotes and digressions. Pronounce
meander with three syllables not two Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; me-AN-der.
