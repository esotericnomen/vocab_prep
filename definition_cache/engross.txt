Engross is a verb that means to consume all of your attention or time. Once you engross yourself in
the culture of high salaries and unlimited spending accounts, it's hard to go back to cooking at a
sandwich shop.

Engross first came into English in the 1400s from the Old French word en gros, meaning in bulk, at
wholesale. By the 1700s the word had taken on the meaning of absorb the whole attention. Immersing
yourself fully in something can be good or bad. If you're studying Shakespeare, you want the plays
to engross you so you don't lose focus. But if your video games engross you so much that you forget
to shower or eat, that's a problem.
