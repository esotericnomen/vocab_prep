It doesn't sound as cute as puppy, but whelp means the same thing: a baby dog or wolf. This can also
be a verb, as in The mama poodle whelped six whelps.

Besides applying to canines such as wolves and coyotes, whelp is sometimes used to describe a young
person. This usually isn't a compliment. If an older person calls a young person a whelp or says, I
don't know what's wrong with you whelps these days!, you can be sure they're not impressed by
youngsters. To someone who studies animals, whelp is just the word for a puppy or for birthing. Like
so many other words, the meaning depends on who's saying it and why.
