Proponent means someone who is in favor of something. You might be a proponent of longer vacations,
but your parents are proponents of a longer school year.

If you’re in favor of long school vacations, you’re pro or for long vacations. The prefix pro-
also carries the meaning of “forward,” “ahead,” or “before.” All of these senses are at
work in proponent: someone who suggests (puts forward) an idea or who is in favor of an idea. A
proponent proposes an idea or advocates for a proposal or a proposition.
