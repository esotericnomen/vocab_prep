The adjective venturesome describes someone who is willing to take risks, someone brave. If you have
a venturesome child, you may worry because she's the one you find on top of the playhouse instead of
inside it.

The root word of venturesome is venture, and venture is short for aventure, which is a form of
adventure, which we understand to be an interesting or exciting experience. Some people are more
venturesome than others. You may thrive on mountain climbing or going to the top of the Eiffel
Tower, or your idea of adventure may be occasionally trying a strawberry jelly with your peanut
butter instead of grape.
