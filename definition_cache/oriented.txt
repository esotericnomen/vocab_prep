To be oriented is to be positioned in a direction relative to something or someplace else, and it's
often used with the prepositions toward or away from. In order to find our way home, we should be
oriented toward the north.

You can be oriented towards or away from all sorts of things, not only geographic ones. For example,
if you like sports, you might be called sports-oriented. If politics is your thing, then you're
politically oriented.    For millennia, people have used the North Star to orient themselves,
because it's always in the same place in the sky.
