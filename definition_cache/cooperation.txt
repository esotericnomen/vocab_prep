Working together is cooperation. Thanks to the cooperation of the parents, teachers, and students,
the end of year school dance rocked the house without rocking the boat.

If you break apart cooperation you see co which means together and operation which is a project or
job. When you practice cooperation you are working together on a job or project. Cooperation can
sometimes be hard to come by, which is why when someone does a lot of it, it's nice to say thank
you.
