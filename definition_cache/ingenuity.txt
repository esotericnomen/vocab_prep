Ingenuity is the ability to think creatively about a situation or to solve problems in a clever way.
If you want to build a boat out of toothpicks and yarn, you’ll need a lot of ingenuity.

The Latin word for “mind, intellect” is a root of ingenuity, and it takes a bright and fast-
thinking intellect to use ingenuity in a situation. Athletes show ingenuity all the time, finding
exciting ways to outwit their opponents and to achieve victory. Master criminals rely on their
ingenuity in order to evade the law when they are chased. Ingenuity is all about imagination, and an
imaginative mind knows that every obstacle can be overcome with a little ingenuity.
