If someone tells you you’re the quintessential rock musician, that means they think that
everything about you screams “rock and roll.” Quintessential means embodying or possessing the
essence of something.

Some people think that baseball is the quintessential American sport. (Others might think it's stock
car racing.) We also call something quintessential if it’s absolutely necessary. A quintessential
part of a lasting friendship is mutual respect. Good computer skills are quintessential if you want
to become the world’s greatest hacker.
