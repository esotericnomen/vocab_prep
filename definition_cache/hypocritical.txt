Hypocritical involves acting in a way that goes against your stated beliefs. If you drive drunk
despite the fact that you are the president of Students Against Drunk Driving, you are truly
hypocritical.

often when discussing political and religious figures who are sometimes caught engaging in behavior
that goes against their professed beliefs. A person who engages in hypocritical behavior could be
