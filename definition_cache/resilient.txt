When something is strong and able to recover from damage quickly, call it resilient. If you're rough
on your toys, the ones that don't break are resilient.

Formed from the Latin verb resilÊúùre to leap back, a resilient person is able to recover from an
illness or a bad experience quickly. Politicians who are resilient to media criticism do not let
critical journalists affect their focus, performance or relationship to their constituents. An
object can be resilient also, but in this case, it is not damaged easily, or it returns to its
original good shape quickly.
