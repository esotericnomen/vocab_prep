“Darn you!” “Go bury your head in the sand.” “You ugly nincompoop!” Each of those nasty
curses is a malediction (and, I’m sure, nothing you would ever say to another human being).

A malediction is a curse. Not like the kind a witch puts on someone, but close. More like what the
schoolyard bully says to hurt someone’s feelings. On purpose. Malediction has male in it, but
it’s not a slur against men or boys. Mal comes from the Latin for evil and diction, and as you may
remember, has to do with what we say. So a malediction is an evil statement directed at someone
else. Pretty nasty, if you ask me.
