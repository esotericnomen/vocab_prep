Someone who is self-indulgent gives themselves a lot of treats. Parents who are indulgent cave to
ever desire their child expresses. Indulgent means lenient, or overly generous.

Indulgent is a word that, here in Puritanical North America, is hard to know how to take. Is it okay
to â&euro;&oelig;indulge yourselfâ&euro;? as so many spa advertisements suggest? Or is indulgent
always associated with excess? You can indulge fantasies of figuring out the answer, or you can give
in to an indulgent shrug and move on to another word.
