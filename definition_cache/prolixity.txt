If someone likes to talk but they're really boring, they've got prolixity. It's not something to be
proud of.

Prolixity means about the same thing as long-windedness. If someone is yammering on and on and on
— that's an example of prolixity. Part of prolixity seems good: we'd all like to be able to put
words together easily. On the other hand, none of us want to be boring. That's a major downside to
prolixity. Prolixity is similar to wordiness — using too many words, or too many long words —
when a few would get the job done.
