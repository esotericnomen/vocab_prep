If you belch, interrupt a conversation, or leave the table during dinner, you’re expected to say
“Pardon me.” Once you’ve requested your companions’ pardon, or forgiveness, you can assume
you have it; you don’t need to wait for their response.

The word pardon often occurs in the phrases “Pardon me” and “I beg your pardon.” (While “I
beg your pardon” literally means “I request your forgiveness,” it’s used to indicate that
the speaker did not hear what was just said.) Outside of these everyday phrases, pardon is typically
used in formal or legal situations. If the president pardons a criminal, for example, the criminal
is forgiven in the sense that he or she no longer has to serve the penalty for the crime.
