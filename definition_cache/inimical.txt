Censorship is inimical to freedom. So, most teenagers would argue, are curfews. To be inimical is to
be harmful, antagonistic, or opposed to — like smoking two packs a day is to healthy lungs.

Inimical comes from the Latin word inimicus, meaning enemy. It suggests acting like someone's
enemy––being adverse, damaging, or downright hostile. It can refer to anything from emotions and
actions to public policy. Be careful not to mix it up with inimitable, which means too good to be
copied.
