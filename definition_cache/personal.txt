When something's personal, it's all about you. A personal decision is one you make on your own and
it’s probably about something that concerns you, too. Your personal possessions are things that
belong to you.

No doubt you've noticed the word person, in personal. The word comes from the Latin personalis, of a
person. Personal can be your personal habits — how often your brush your teeth, whether you like
broccoli — or your personal space, or a personal attack — mean-spirited criticism aimed at
somebody in particular. The Personals section in your local newspaper is where people place ads
hoping to find true love or with other personal messages.
