If you are someone who still loves the old joke: Your epidermis is showing, natation is a word for
you. It means floating but sounds like a terrible disease.

If you want to get really fancy, use this word in its two adjective forms: invite friends to swim in
your pool by suggesting a natatorial adventure? Or refer to your bathing suit as natatory attire.
Although it sounds academic, natation is the simple act of flotation.
