If you've got a whole slew of complaints to get off your chest or requests to make,  you've got
yourself a litany — a long, drawn-out list.

From Greek origins meaning entreaty or supplication, litany often refers to certain long responsive
petitions offered to God, particularly by practitioners of the Christian faith. For some reason,
litany is usually used in reference to negative things — such as a litany of complaints or a
litany of injuries.
