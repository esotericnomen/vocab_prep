A flounder is a flat fish with both eyes on one side of its head; and, as a verb, to flounder is to
wobble around like a fish out of water.

To flounder is to be unsteady or uncertain. It's probably from the Dutch word floddern, to flop
about, or it's a mix of founder (to fail) and blunder (do something clumsy). If you flounder in the
ocean, you need a surfer dude to scoop you up. You don't have to be in water, though; you can
flounder any time you're a little wobbly Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; like after a long hike or during the last
hour of the SATs. Either way, when you flounder, you wish you were a flat fish at the bottom of the
sea.
