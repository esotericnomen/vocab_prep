Take the noun tenure for the period of time a person holds a position or office. Your tenure as a
student ends when you graduate high school â€” unless, of course, you go on to college.

Tenure from the Latin tenere means to hold and refers to the period of time a person works at a
particular job or in an office. A president might have to deal with a recession during his tenure in
the White House. In university jargon, if you have tenure, you have a permanent teaching position or
professorship. In this sense, tenure can also be used as a verb. You've got it made if you're
tenured at age 29.
