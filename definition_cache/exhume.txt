When you see your mysterious neighbor digging around in his backyard, you may wonder if he’s
trying to exhume something. Chances are he’s only digging up potatoes — when you exhume
something, it means you’re digging up a corpse.

The word exhume traces back to the Latin word exhumare, a combination of ex-, meaning “out of,”
and humus, or “ground.” That meaning holds true today: when you exhume something, you dig it up
out of the ground. The word almost always applies to the removing of a previously buried corpse,
such as law enforcement officials who exhume a body to perform an autopsy or collect evidence
related to an investigation.
