A week at the beach that goes perfectly is an idyllic vacation. Idyllic means so wonderful it seems
almost magical.

Are you having an idyllic childhood? You may not think so now, but in your old age, you may remember
your days as a youngster as simple and carefree. The clear, blue water of the Caribbean Sea, the
beautiful village perched on a cliffside, the sunny grassy field of wildflowers, these are all
Idylls â&euro;&rdquo; simple peaceful scenes â&euro;&rdquo; that you may or may not find idyllic.
