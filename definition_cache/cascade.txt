Think of a cascade as something suddenly falling, tumbling down in a rush.

The word cascade conjures up a vision of anything falling in a manner resembling a waterfall
Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; think of a cascade of shining hair, a sudden cascade of tears, or the cascade of
light during a meteor shower. The idea behind the word is of something falling in a progressive
manner or a series of steps. A downward progression of musical themes can be called a cascade, as
can the disastrous cascade of the tumbling price of a stock on Wall Street.
