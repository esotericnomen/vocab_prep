To mortify someone is to cause them extreme embarrassment. Your mother may not have been trying to
mortify you when she showed up at your senior prom with a bunch of unicorn balloons, but she did.

The root of the verb mortify is from the Latin word mors, which means “death.” To mortify
something used to mean to destroy its life, but now mortify is mostly used when you feel so ashamed
or embarrassed you “want to die.” To punish yourself through deprivation from food or another
desire, you can mortify that compulsion, but it’s probably best to just mortify your parents by
showing up at their work place with a new mohawk.
