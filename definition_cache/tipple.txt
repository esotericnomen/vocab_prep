Use the verb tipple when you want to show that someone drinks moderately but regularly. During
Prohibition in the 1920s it was illegal to tipple but today you can tipple almost anywhere â€” as
long as you are 21.

As a noun, a tipple is an alcoholic drink. Your usual tipple may be a glass of wine with dinner, but
at a summer barbecue your tipple may be beer. From tipple we also get the noun tippler, is a person
who drinks regularly but moderately. Experts aren't sure where the word tipple comes from, but it
may be from a Norwegian word, tipla, which means to drink slowly.
