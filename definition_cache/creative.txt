Do you like to make art? Do you like to write? Would you like to design clothes or buildings? Then
you are a creative person.

Creative has to do with new things coming into being: creative is the opposite of destructive. Art
class and art schools are good places to be creative. All the artists in a place are known as the
creative community. But being creative isn't just about art Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; to make anything new or
come up with any kind of an idea takes creativity and is therefore creative. Whenever you're making
something worthwhile, you're being creative.
