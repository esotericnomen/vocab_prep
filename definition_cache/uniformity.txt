Have you ever noticed that even though you and your friend have different history teachers, you are
both learning the same thing? That is because of the uniformity, or consistency, of the curriculum.

Think about the word uniform. When you see police officers or students in uniform, it makes them all
kind of look the same. If things don't change, you can say there is uniformity. Uniformity can be a
good or a bad thing. A uniformity in TV shows would be boring. On the other hand, you would like to
see uniformity among the standards of medical schools, so you know all doctors are qualified.
