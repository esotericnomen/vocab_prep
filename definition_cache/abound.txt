When things abound, there are a lot of them. In spring, birds, flowers, rain, and frisbees abound.

This word has to do with an abundance of something. In cities like Buffalo, NY, snow abounds. In
very hot weather, insects and suntan lotion abound. Dogs are happy at the park when squirrels abound
-- meaning there are a lot of squirrels. On the moon, rocks abound, but that's about it.
