Sensible means practical and reasonable. If you're wearing sensible shoes, they're sturdy,
comfortable, good for walking, and your feet don't hurt. If you're a sensible person, you're level-
headed and calm, and you make wise decisions.

Sensible may not sound exciting Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; who wants to be like a pair of galoshes, when you
can be stilettos? But sensible is the voice of reason, and when you're tooling along in your
convertible, you'll be grateful for the sensible 15-mile-per-hour speed limit posted at that sharp
turn where the road drops off into the canyon. Sensible comes from the Latin sensibilis, meaning
perceptible by the senses, a meaning that eventually evolved into having good sense, reasonable.
