A reckoning is a calculation or number you estimate. You might say, By my reckoning, there are now
seventeen kids in the bouncy house, which might be a few too many.

The act of counting or tallying can be called a reckoning, and so can a person's opinion on
something. You could describe an ancient astronomer's reckoning that the Earth was at the center of
the universe or your own reckoning that guests should never stay more than three days. The Old
English gerecenian is the root of reckoning, to count, recount, or relate.
