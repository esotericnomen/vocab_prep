Corrode means to eat away at and cause to deteriorate, like rust slowly taking over an old bike left
out in the rain.

Stemming from a Latin word that means to gnaw away, corrode is a verb that usually describes
destroying a metal by oxidation or by some other kind of chemical action. Acid is particularly
corrosive, or able to corrode things easily. The word corrode can also be used figuratively. Way
back when, the grandmas of the world thought rock music would corrode the minds of young people.
Thank goodness that didn't really pan out.
