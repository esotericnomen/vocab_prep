If a police officer falls in love with a witness in a case, it might be hard for him to stay
objective â€” that is, looking at things in a detached, impartial, fact-based way.

The opposite of objective is subjective, influenced by personal feelings or opinions. Of course, an
objective view isn't always preferable to a subjective one; it would be hard to imagine an art
critic who stayed objective. The word comes from the Latin ob against + jacere to throw; an
objective view is one that considers only things that have been thrown against your eyes, so to
speak. Objective has also been used as a noun meaning a goal, as in military objectives.
