A psychic reads minds and predicts the future. If you were a psychic, you wouldn't have bothered
reading this because you would have known what I was going to say.

Psychic can also describe something that has to do with your mind more than your body. You weren't
physically harmed when your favorite team lost the championship game, but the psychic pain was
considerable. Psychic comes from a Greek word meaning “breath” and “soul”: psychic matters
are often felt but not seen.
