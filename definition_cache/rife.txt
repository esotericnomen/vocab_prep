If your supervisor at work describes your new position as “rife with opportunities for
advancement,” then rejoice! That means your position offers many opportunities for advancement.

Not to be confused with the word ripe (“fully grown or developed”), the adjective rife means
“abundant” or “frequently occurring.” When used in a sentence, rife can follow the word that
it’s describing, as in “development was rife during his administration” or “speculation was
rife before the announcement.” More commonly, however, rife comes before the word it modifies and
is used with the preposition with, as in “the class was rife with enthusiasm” or “her story
was rife with inconsistencies.”
