Although the verb collate specifically means to put pages in a correct order, the word can be used
more generally to mean to put anything into the proper sequence.

Collating can mean the mindless job of putting papers in order before stapling them, or it can mean
the high-brow analytical job of critically comparing multiple texts. Both usually involve paper,
only the latter involves higher-order thinking. The genealogists collated data from several sources,
which made them realize, based on the dates, that Henry the VIII could not have been on the family
tree.
