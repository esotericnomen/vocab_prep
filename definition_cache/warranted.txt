If you watch cop shows, you know that a warrant is something police need to get into your house â€”
a permission slip from a judge.

It's a noun! It's a verb! It's a word that warrants our attention! As a noun, it's the piece of
paper they show you through the keyhole during an investigation. It's also a reason for doing
something, or a promise (think of the warranty on your new car, the promise that it'll work for a
certain amount of time). As a verb, it means to make something seem reasonable or necessary, such
when the ticking suitcase warrants bringing in the bomb squad, or when the teenager's sneaking in
late again warrants a stricter curfew.
