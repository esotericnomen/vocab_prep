Concentric describes something, like circles, that have a common center.

Concentric is from the Latin word concentricus, from com (together) plus centrum (center or circle).
So, concentric things have a center in common. If you play darts, you aim for the smallest red dot
of those colorful concentric circles. Although it's usually used to describe circles, ideas can also
be concentric if they have a common point, such as when your dreams revolve around a concentric
theme of flying. The opposite word is eccentric (not having a common center) like that oddball
neighbor you have nothing in common with.
