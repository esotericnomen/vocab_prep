If everything in your room is pink, your room is monochromatic — all of one color.

In physics, monochromatic describes light that has the same wavelength so it is one color. Broken
into Greek roots, the word shows its meaning: monos means one, and khroma means color. Things that
are truly monochromatic are rare — examine the green leaves of trees and you'll see lots of
different shades.
