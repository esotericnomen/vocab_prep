You might think a fiat is just an Italian car, but it actually means a legal, authoritative decision
that has absolute sanction.

From the Latin for let it be done, the word fiat is a binding edict issued by a person in command.
It  can gain an almost Biblical aura of authority, like a movie Pharaoh saying, So let it be
written, so let it be done. So let it be a fiat.
