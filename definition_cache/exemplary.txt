Exemplary people excel at what they do and are excellent examples to others. Something exemplary is
so good that it is an example for others to follow.

When something is the best it can be or reaches the highest point, it is exemplary and thus worth
imitating. Exemplary comes from the Latin exemplum, meaning sample or example. While some people and
things are held as examples of what not to do, an exemplary person or thing is always a positive
example. A country can have an exemplary record of preventing pollution, and a person may have an
exemplary reputation just for being all-around praiseworthy or noble.
