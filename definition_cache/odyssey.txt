Ever since Homer’s epic poem The Odyssey told the story of warrior Odysseus’ ten-year journey
home from Troy, odyssey has meant any epic journey.

As with the word journey, odyssey has both a literal meaning and a figurative one. A cross-country
drive in which your car breaks down can be an odyssey, but so can the journey from orientation to
finals that is the freshman year of college.
