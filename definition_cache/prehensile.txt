Prehensile means able to grasp and often refers to such body parts as claws, feet, and tails.
Elephants curl their prehensile noses around objects in order to pick them up.

Prehensile is an adjective that comes from a French word for “grasped.” Humans and other
primates (like monkeys, lemurs, and gorillas) have prehensile hands with curling fingers for
grasping — a definite advantage over dogs, for instance, who can’t use a pencil when poetic
inspiration strikes them. Prehensile can also mean greedy or grasping for riches.
