When something is a figment of your imagination, it means that you made it up. It's something that
might seem real, but is really not.

What does a fig- (not the fruit fig) have to do with something made up inside your head? It has to
do with Latin, as usual â&euro;&rdquo; both figment and fiction derive from the same Latin word.
But it might help to think of figment as a fig leaf â&euro;&rdquo; a figment is something flimsy
and easily blown away.
