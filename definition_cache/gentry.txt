The gentry are the powerful members of society. In the United Kingdom, where there are still kings
and queens and dukes and duchesses, the gentry are the people who rank just below the nobility.

Gentry can also refer to the important people in any field. The gentry of rock 'n' roll would
include icons like Chuck Berry and Elvis Presley. The gentry of Hollywood are the stars everyone
recognizes, the faces you constantly see on magazine covers, starring in movies, and making TV
appearances. The gentry of New York society are the people who make major donations to art museums
and hospitals and are A-list invitees to all the big fundraisers and cultural events.
