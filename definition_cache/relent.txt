Being unwilling to relent is a good qualification for a sales person. You have to keep trying to
make the sale and never give in until you've made it.

The root of relent is the Latin lentus, which means to slow down or soften, and the original meaning
(from the 15th century, no less) most likely had to do with the heart Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; as in to stop
resisting love. Now, however, relent can have all manner of relevant applications, but the meaning
is always the same: to let up, soften, yield or give in. Often, you'll hear the adjective relentless
used to describe someone who won't relent: The firemen refused to relent; they banged relentlessly
on the door until I woke up.
