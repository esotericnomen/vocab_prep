To sap something is to drain or deplete something over time.  If you sap a maple tree, you drain the
liquid inside it to make maple syrup.  But if you sap a person of strength, you've rendered him
defenseless.

Whether used as a noun or verb, sap is rarely a good thing. If your energy or will is sapped, it’s
not meant lightly; it means you have been exhausted of all your reserve energy, you’re reduced to
a shell. If someone calls you a sap, it suggests you lack strength and character. And if you get sap
— the sticky liquid inside a tree — on your hands, good luck getting it off in the middle of a
forest without a bar of soap and running water.  Yuck.
