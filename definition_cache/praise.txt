Praise means admiration or approval, and when you're on the receiving end of it, you feel great.

Whether it's used as a verb or a noun, praise means approval. If you enthusiastically praise your
dog, he's likely to wag his tail and expect a treat. What you've given him (in addition to the
treat) is praise, the noun. In a religious context, the verb praise is interchangeable with worship,
as when a minister says, Praise God.
