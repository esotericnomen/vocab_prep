Inconspicuous describes something that doesn't stand out or attract attention. The bad news? You
just got pizza sauce on your shirt. The good news? It landed in an inconspicuous spot, so no one
will notice.

Inconspicuous comes from the Latin word inconspicuus, or not visible, and the original meaning of
inconspicuous was invisible, until around 1828. Today, it describes anything that blends in or isn't
very noticeable. If you have ever tried to find your black luggage among all the other pieces of
black luggage at the airport, you know that sometimes, being inconspicuous makes things harder.
