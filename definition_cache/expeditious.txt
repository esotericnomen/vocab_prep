Anything expeditious is speedy and efficient. People like shortcuts because they are expeditious.

If you can do things quickly and well, then you're good at being expeditious. In math, there are
often many ways to get an answer: the quickest method is the most expeditious. There might be many
ways to get home from school, but the fastest is the most expeditious. But there's more to being
expeditious than just speed â€” you have to get a good result too. If you solve a problem quickly
but get it wrong, that's not very expeditious.
