If you meet up with any witches on Halloween, don’t drink the potion they offer you. This liquid
could be poisonous, magical, or it could simply taste very strange.

While a potion can be any drinkable liquid, it usually refers to medicinal concoctions or mysterious
brews, as found in fairy tales and fables. This noun is related to the Latin verb, potare, which
means, “to drink.” You might also notice its similarity to the adjective potable, another word
for “drinkable.” Some common types you may read about or hear about are “sleeping potions,”
“love potions,” and “magic potions.”
