A referendum is an official vote on a specific issue. It's often part of a larger election.

On many issues, our elected representatives argue, negotiate, and make a law, but sometimes there's
a referendum â&euro;&rdquo; the issue is put directly to the people for a vote as part of an
election. Past referendums have been on gay marriage and the legalization of marijuana. Usually, a
referendum is a yes or no question. Smaller groups can have referendums too â&euro;&rdquo; like a
school system deciding whether or not to have school uniforms or a longer school year.
