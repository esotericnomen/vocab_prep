A boor is a crude, rude person. Boors lack sophistication and manners.

Boors are worse than boring; theyâ&euro;&trade;re offensive and repulsive. To be a boor is to be an
obnoxious, unsophisticated oaf. A boor would swear in church. A boor would talk too loudly on the
train. A boor would get too drunk at a wedding reception. Boors lack manners and taste. When a boor
is around, other people want to leave. If you have self-control and culture, youâ&euro;&trade;ll
never be accused of being a boor.
