A bellhop is a person whose job involves carrying people's luggage in a hotel. When you check into a
fancy inn, the bellhop will take your suitcase up to your room for you.

You can also call a bellhop a bellboy, unless she's a woman, in which case bellhop makes more sense.
The main job of a bellhop is to help hotel customers transport their luggage to their rooms, or to
their cars when they're checking out. The word comes from the old fashioned hotel practice of the
desk clerk ringing a bell to summon the bellhop -- who would presumably hop to work, hurrying to
help with the patron's bags.
