A  laceration is a tear, cut, or gash. Your heart can also get a more figurative laceration when you
see your love kissing another. Either way, ouch.

A laceration implies that there is a tearing or jaggedness to the wound. A surgeon would not make a
laceration on a patient, but an incision. Lacerations are reserved for things like barbed wire,
errant nails, and fickle loves.
