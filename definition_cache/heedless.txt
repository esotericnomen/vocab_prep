Someone heedless is reckless or not paying attention. Heedless rhymes with needless, and someone
who's heedless acts as if needed things are needless. If you head out to surf in a tsunami, you're
heedless of the giant-wave warnings.

When you pay heed to something you pay attention to it or consider it, but if youâ&euro;&trade;re
heedless you do the opposite. Sometimes being heedless means being a risk-taker in an exciting way,
or it can just mean losing track of time, but often it describes being inconsiderate. If you keep
raising the volume when your brother asks you to turn down the music, youâ&euro;&trade;re heedless
of his need to study, and if you're heedless of the yellow tape that says Do not cross, you
disregard the law.
