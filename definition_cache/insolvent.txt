Piggy bank empty? Nothing but lint in your pockets? Then you're probably unable to meet any
financial obligations. In other words, you are insolvent.

Being insolvent isn't just about being poor. A person or business that's insolvent has no resources,
no assets and no way to pay any of the bills. This adjective insolvent is a synonym for bankrupt,
and surely the last thing anyone wants to be. The only way to solve the problem of insolvency? Start
saving your pennies again from scratch.
