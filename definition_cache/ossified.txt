Use the adjective ossified to describe someone who's become stuck in his ways. You might feel that
your uncle has become an ossified suburban soccer dad, set in his unbending view of the world and
comfortable lifestyle.

When your habits or views have solidified into inflexible patterns -- especially if those views are
conservative -- you can describe yourself as ossified. It's not a compliment to call someone
ossified, since it implies an inability to change or bend or even to consider another person's
viewpoint. The root is ossify, to turn into bone, from the Latin word for bone, os.
