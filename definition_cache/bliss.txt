Bliss is a state of complete happiness or joy. Marriage is often associated with this joyous
feeling: people who are married and still in love are described as living in wedded bliss.

Another common association is heaven or paradise, as in eternal bliss. Bliss is from Middle English
blisse, from Old English bliss, bl朝ths. The final -s in this Old English word is actually a suffix
and the word itself is related to bl朝the, the source of modern English blithe, which means happy.
