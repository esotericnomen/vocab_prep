When you're riding a horse and scream Whoa! to make it stop, you're pulling on the reins, which are
attached to a thing called the bridle, the buckled straps around a horse's head that help you
control its movements.

The word bridle comes from the Old English bridel meaning rein, curb, restraint, which is precisely
what the purpose of a bridle is â€” to help restrain a horse's movements when necessary. You can
bridle a horse, which is the act of putting a bridle on it. If you yank too hard on the reins, your
horse might bridle, or take offense to your aggressiveness, just like you might bridle if someone
insulted you.
