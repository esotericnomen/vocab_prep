The noun hazard means something dangerous, and the adjective hazardous refers to anything that
involves danger. A golf course with lots of sand traps is especially hazardous for golfers. That's
why those traps are called hazards.

If your car blows a tire in the middle of the night, make sure to turn on your hazard lights. Being
invisible to other drivers is hazardous to everyone, especially yourself. Life is, by definition,
hazardous. It's full of dangers, both obvious and otherwise. Acknowledge that fact and keep going
anyway. If you spend all your time focusing on what's hazardous, you end up missing all the
wonderful things in life.
