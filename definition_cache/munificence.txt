Munificence is the quality of being extremely generous, like showering your girlfriend with lots of
expensive gifts and candy on Valentine's Day.

Munificence comes from the Latin word, munificentia, which literally means present-making. Santa
Claus shows great munificence every year by bringing presents to children, even if sometimes they've
been naughty. Munificence can refer to any kind of generosity or ease in giving. A millionaire who
donates time and money to help support the less fortunate shows munificence. Of course, munificence
is easy for those with millions!
