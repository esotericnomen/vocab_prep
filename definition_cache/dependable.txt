Dependable means reliable, steady, trustworthy. If people can always count on you, that means you
are dependable.

The adjective dependable can also mean consistent in performance or behavior, like a dependable car
that always starts and rarely needs service or a dependable actor who always does a great job,
regardless of the role. Dependable can also be used to describe something that is financially sound,
like an investment that brings profit with little risk.
