Anything genetic has to do with your genes and DNA. You inherited your mom's eye color because it's
genetic.

Genetic traits run in families: biological families, anyway. Anything genetic is related to your
DNA, the material you inherited from your biological parents. Hair color, eye color, and other
physical traits are genetic, and so are some diseases. Scientists do genetic research to see how
knowing what√¢&euro;&trade;s in your genes could help keep you well. If you're healthy, one reason
is good genetics.
