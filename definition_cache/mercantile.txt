What do merchants want to do? Buy and sell things to make a profit. The adjective mercantile
describes these kinds of efforts and goals.

Many people have mercantile dreams of opening a store where they can sell things they love and
interact with people in their community. Sometimes, however, the word mercantile has negative
connotations. Exploiting factory workers, polluting the environment, wasting natural resources? All
these reflect the dark side of the mercantile pursuit of profit.
