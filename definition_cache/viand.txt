A viand is something really delicious. The grilled cheese sandwich at the diner near your house
that’s better than any other grilled cheese sandwich in a 400 mile radius? That’s a viand.

Viand comes from the Old French word viande, meaning “food.” A viand is something so good
you’ll think about it for weeks after you eat it. Your grandmother’s Thanksgiving turkey might
be a viand, or maybe the hot chocolate you drink after sledding is a viand. No matter what you
consider delicious, you’re lucky if you’re eating a viand.
