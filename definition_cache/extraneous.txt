Extraneous means coming from or belonging to the outside—extraneous noise is what you hear when
you're in a theater and a train passes by, extraneous wires bring your cable connection into the
house.

In Latin, extra means outside, as in extraordinary outside the ordinary, or extraterrestrial 'coming
from outside earth.' (Bonus points––ding! ding!––if you knew that terra is Latin for earth.)
The meaning of extraneous also extends to more abstract things that come from the outside:
extraneous details are ones that don't matter.
