Whorl describes something that looks like loops — a strand of curly hair that boings back up when
you pull in then let it go, a corkscrew, even the track of a roller coaster that spins you in every
direction.

Use whorl to describe a thing that swirls or curls — the loops of icing on a birthday cake, the
spiral curves of a mountain road, or a lock of curly hair. Whorl is also a good word to describe a
flower whose petals form layer after layer of circles. Don't confuse the noun whorl with its
homophone whirl, a verb that means to spin in a circle.
