The lumen is a unit of measurement for the brightness of light. If a light bulb is blindingly
bright, it produces a lot of lumens.

The lumen is a basic unit for measuring brightness, just as the gram is a basic unit for measuring
mass. A typical light bulb in your home might produce about 1000 lumens. Lumen is related to the
word luminous, which means “bright” or “radiant.”
