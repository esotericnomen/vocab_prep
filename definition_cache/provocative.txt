If something is provocative, it provokes a reaction. A provocative, or low cut blouse might make
people think you're sexy. A provocative statement, such as I hate babies, will get another kind of
reaction.

The action, thought, or feeling is often a desired one, called forth on purpose. In fact,
provocative is often used to describe actions or ways of dressing that cause sexual feelings. But
provocative things can also call forth something unwanted: She was angered by the provocative
remarks. This adjective was borrowed from French provocatif, from Late Latin provocativus calling
forth, from Latin provocare to call forth, challenge.
