To garner means to gather or earn. If you want to run for office without belonging to a political
party, you must garner enough signatures — usually a few thousand — to get onto the ballot.

The word garner comes from the Latin granarium which means store-house, usually for grain. The
current use of the word carries with it the sense of something being stored up. It’s not only that
you can gather enough yes-votes to overcome the opposition, there is the sense that all the things
you have garnered have some weight of their own. In its other use, garner means “earn” or merit.
Think of movie stars garnering Oscar nominations for their excellent work.
