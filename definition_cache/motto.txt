A motto is a slogan or favorite saying, like When life hands you lemons, make lemonade.

A motto is something you might see on a t-shirt or bumper sticker — a short sentence or phrase
that has meaning for that person. Some mottoes have to do with politics, religion, or another
belief. Sometimes People write their motto on a large banner or sign so others can see it. President
John F. Kennedy's motto was “Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for
your country.” Mottoes are similar to proverbs, slogans, and catchphrases.
