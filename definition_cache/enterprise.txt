Enterprise describes a readiness to act boldly to get something started, like the enterprise it
takes to start a charity with only a dream and a few dollars.

Another meaning of enterprise is a business venture, like a frozen yogurt enterprise. It requires a
lot of determination, hard work and the steady belief that people will love your yogurt. People will
say you show extraordinary enterprise for your willingness to take on such a challenging project,
meaning you have initiative and drive.
