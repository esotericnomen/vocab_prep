An oaf is the boring, ill-mannered person you hope doesn't show up at your party and send the other
guests running for the door.

There are many ways to be an oaf: you can be loud, insensitive, rude, or just plain stupid. The word
is related to the Old English word for elf, and originally meant a changeling â&euro;&rdquo; an
elf's child, a little darling not known for good manners â&euro;&rdquo; and you probably wouldn't
want one of them at your party either.
