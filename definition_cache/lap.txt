Your lap is the top of your thighs when you sit down, where your cat might sit. Lap can also refer
to a trip around a racetrack, or to the act of overtaking a competitor by a lap.

Lap is associated with a number of idioms. If something falls into your lap, you have gotten
something without making much effort. For example, maybe you discovered a rare fossil in your yard
while looking for your lost baseball. If you sold that fossil for a lot of money, you may find
yourself now sitting in the lap of luxury. That√¢&euro;&trade;s a wonderful place to be!
