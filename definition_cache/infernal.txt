Things that come from Hell, or seem like they do, are infernal. If your father tells you to stop
listening to that infernal music, he thinks your tunes are hellish on the ears.

The word infernal comes from infernus, the Latin word for underground. A related word is inferno
which means a really big fire, the kind that you might find in Hell. Although it might be used to
describe something really hot or something evil, infernal is usually used when someone is
complaining about something they really don't like such as the infernal dog next door that keeps
barking.
