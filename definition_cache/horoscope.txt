You can usually read your daily horoscope in the local newspaper. A horoscope is a forecast of your
future based on the month in which you were born.

Some people believe that a horoscope is a real way to divine the future; they think that traits and
circumstances are determined from the position of the planets at the exact moment of a person's
birth. Others enjoy reading their horoscopes just for fun. The word horoscope has a Greek root,
hĹ?roskopos, combining hĹ?ra, time or hour, and skopos, observer or watching. A horoscope, in
other words, is something that watches the hour of one's birth.
