Determination can be a decision, or the focus you need to get something done.

The sense of determination, as making up your mind about something, finds its roots in an Old French
word meaning Ã¢&euro;&oelig;decision, such as the judge's determination that the man was guilty, or
the panel's determination that the chocolate was too bitter. Usually the decision comes after much
consideration and research, like when Copernicus made the determination that the earth revolves
around the sun. The word has come to mean also grit, gumption, pluck, persistence: With hard work
and determination, they were able finish the school project on time.
