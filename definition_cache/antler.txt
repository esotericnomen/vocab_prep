An antler is one of a pair of horns that belong to most members of the deer family. An antler is
usually curved and has branches.

Antlers come in pairs: there are two antlers coming out of a deer√¢&euro;&trade;s head. Antlers are
branched like a tree limb, and some are very long and large. The elk is an animal with impressive
antlers. Antlers look intimidating and can be used as a weapon by the deer when head-butting. Only
the males have antlers in most species.
