A paradigm is a standard, perspective, or set of ideas. A paradigm is a way of looking at something.

A paradigm is a new way of looking or thinking about something is needed. This word comes up a lot
in the academic, scientific, and business worlds. A new paradigm in business could mean a new way of
reaching customers and making money. In education, relaying on lectures is a paradigm: if you
suddenly shifted to all group work, that would be a new paradigm. When you change paradigms, you're
changing how you think about something.
