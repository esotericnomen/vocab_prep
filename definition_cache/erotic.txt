Use erotic to describe a sexy, sexy person. What makes that person so sexy? Maybe his or her erotic
attitude or looks, meaning arousing.

The word erotic came into English from French — of course! — and can be traced back to the Greek
word erōtikos, from erōs or erōt-, meaning “sexual love.” The adjective erotic is often used
to describe a person’s carnal desires, but it can be used to characterize anything that’s sexual
in nature or that arouses sexual desires, such as the erotic themes in a racy movie, an erotic
dancer in a club, or erotic images in a painting.
