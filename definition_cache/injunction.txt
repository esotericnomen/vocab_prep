If your school begins building a swimming pool on land that does not belong to it, the city might
issue an injunction to stop it. An injunction is an official order issued by a judge.

In general injunctions are court ordered settlements or commands. In the United States, judges
cannot create laws, but they can require someone to do something or to stop doing something. If you
were wrongly fired from a job, a court may issue an injunction to your former employer, requiring
him or her to hire you back or pay your back salary.
