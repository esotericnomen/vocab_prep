People who go to church but don't believe in god? People who are vegetarians on a moral basis but
wear leather jackets? They are engaging in hypocrisy, or behavior that is different from what they
say they believe.

A hypocrite is a person who practices hypocrisy: what they say is not what they do. The noun
hypocrisy descends from the Greek hypokrisis acting on a stage, from hypokrinesthai to play a part,
pretend, from the prefix hypo- under plus  krinein to judge. Many times kids are enraged by their
parents' hypocrisy when parents make their children follow rules they don't follow themselves.
