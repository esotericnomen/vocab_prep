Things that are a total loss — really worthless or damaging — are dross. You could call that
gunk between your teeth that comes out when you floss, dross. No one wants it, and it's harmful if
it stays.

While dross is a noun for stuff that's physically left over or useless, like the nonmetallic stuff
left when metal gets refined, it's also used for people and forms of art. A really bad movie can be
called dross, and a low or despicable person can be dross. Debris, or trash, is another form of
dross. Searching the backyard for unexploded fireworks — the dross of Chinese New Year
celebrations — was a tradition for the kids and a safeguard for the dogs.
