Circuitous means indirect or roundabout. If you're in a hurry to get to the hospital where your wife
is having a baby, you want to take the straightest, fastest way, not a circuitous one!

Circuitous comes from the Latin word circuitus meaning basically a going around. If you're being
circuitous it's like you're going around and around in circles. It can also refer to someone's
manner or speech, if they are not being direct. For example, if you want someone to get you another
piece of cake but just you sit there looking longingly at your empty plate, saying More cake sure
would be nice, then you're being circuitous. And annoying.
