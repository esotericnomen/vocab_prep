It's pitch black in your room so you switch on the lamp, and your room is filled with light. Light
is a source of illumination, whether a natural one (like the sun) or an artificial one (like your
lamp).

Like light itself, the word can take a lot of different forms Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; it can be a noun, an
adjective, or a verb, and it can mean bright or not heavy.  No matter how you define it, though, the
word comes from the Old English word leoht.
