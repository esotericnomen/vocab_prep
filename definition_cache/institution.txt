Universities, banks, and hospitals are all institutions. Until you arrived at the bank, you'd
forgotten that financial institutions were closed for the holiday.  Thank goodness for the ATM!

The noun institution also refers to a long held custom or practice in society. Even if your parents
divorced when you were young, you might strongly believe in the institution of marriage.  Or you
might believe that once you enter the institution of marriage, your next stop will probably be a
mental institution.  Institution can also describe the act of putting something in place.  The
institution of new traffic rules â&euro;&rdquo; green means stop and red means go â&euro;&rdquo;
caused a bit of confusion.
