Repose is a formal or literary term used to mean the act of resting, or the state of being at rest.
Repose is also a state of mind: freedom from worry.

As a verb, repose means to rest or relax, or to rest on something for support: There she was,
reposing on the front porch. The verb is from Middle English, from Old French reposer, from Late
Latin repausÄ re to cause to rest, from the Latin prefix re- again plus pausÄ re to rest.
