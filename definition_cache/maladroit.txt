If you are clumsy, you are maladroit. But the word can mean all kinds of clumsy. Trip over your
words? You are verbally maladroit. Stumble in social situations? You're socially maladroit.

When someone is adroit, they are graceful and nimble; they show a lot of dexterity. Maladroit is the
opposite of that. It means clumsy, but with a hint of overall incompetence. If someone calls you
maladroit, or says that you are a maladroit, they're not being the least bit nice. They mean that
you've bungled something up with your fumbling.
