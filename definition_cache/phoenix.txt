If you want to see a phoenix, simply locate a unicorn or a centaur, and then you'll be in the right
neighborhood. A phoenix is a mythical bird known for rising from its ashes. Don't try that at home!

Accordingly to Arabian legend, the phoenix is a bird that periodically burns to death and is reborn
from its own ashes. For this reason, the phoenix often serves as a symbol of renewal and rebirth.
The name of Phoenix, Arizona, is a direct reference to this idea; Phoenix was built upon the ruins
of a civilization that had collapsed long before, apparently due to drought.
