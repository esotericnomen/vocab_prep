When a lot of bombs fall on a city or area, it is a bombardment. But a bombardment can also mean a
pummeling with lots of other things: questions, spit balls, or e-mails.

During the early stages of a war, the capital city of the country under attack may suffer a severe
bombardment meant to bring on a quick surrender. If there are many casualties or the citizens of the
country are treated brutally by the occupying force, military officials may find themselves under a
bombardment of questions and accusations about how the war was handled.
