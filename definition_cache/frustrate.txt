When you frustrate someone, you do your best to annoy, confuse, or even torment that poor person.
Maybe you constantly change your mind — that's sure to frustrate anyone who tries to make plans
with you.

If you have ever been frustrated while writing, you may have dropped your pen — or pushed away
your keyboard — and stared angrily out the window, thinking, How will I ever do this? Well, that
pent-up doubting that has made you stop is a sure sign you are frustrated. Plans, too, can be
frustrated, like the snow that frustrates our efforts to run our errands.
