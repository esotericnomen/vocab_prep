A continent is one of the seven largest landmasses found on Earth. Asia, Australia, and Africa are
three continents. Can you name the other four?

Some folks forget the continent of Antarctica, because so few humans live there窶馬one of them
permanently. And you might be surprised how many people think that Africa is a country and not a
continent. Due to a process known as continental drift, the extremely slow movement of the
continents across the face of the globe, our world looks very different from the way it did 100
million years ago.
