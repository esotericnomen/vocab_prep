When you're indignant, you're angry about an unfair situation. If you discovered that a teacher gave
ten extra points on a test to all students who sat in the front row, you'd be indignant.

Indignant is from Latin indignus unworthy, and it refers to anger based on unworthy or unfair
behavior rather than merely injury to one's own interests. You may be angry, even furious, if
someone shoves you, but you are indignant if the shove is directed at someone weak or helpless.  The
related noun is indignation, and something that arouses indignation is an indignity.
