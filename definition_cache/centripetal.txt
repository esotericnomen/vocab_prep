Centripetal is an adjective describing a force that brings things toward the center, not unlike the
force of a black hole.

Centripetal is often confused with the word centrifugal. They may begin the same way, but they mean
the exact opposite. Centrifugal is the force that moves things outward. You might remember that
centripetal means to move things in, because the petals on a flower all begin in the middle.
