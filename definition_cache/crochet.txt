You can crochet by winding loops of yarn around a crochet hook, creating little knots that form
patterns and — eventually — blankets, pillow covers, doilies, or hot pads.

If your brother wants to make an afghan out of rainbow-colored yarn, he should learn how to crochet,
or to make textiles by looping yarn with a special hook. Crocheting is similar to knitting, but
people who crochet use a different tool. The word crochet comes from French and is therefore
pronounced crow shay. The root word is croc, or hook.
