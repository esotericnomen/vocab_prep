Something graphic is visual. Graphic design is made of visual elements. A graphic novel tells its
story with pictures. And a story that is too graphic is too good at showing you things that are, for
example, shocking or violent.

Derived from the Greek graphikos, meaning drawn or written, graphic shows up often before words such
as design or art. There's debate over whether Norman Rockwell was a painter or just a graphic
artist. In certain cases, usually involving loaded issues such as violence or sex, graphic means
overly clear in a visual way. Gruesome slasher movies could be too graphic for some viewers, leaving
them feeling sick to their stomachs.
