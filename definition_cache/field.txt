This word has many meanings — such as a field of daffodils, a field of study, or a field of battle
in a war. Think of a field as an area, either physically or subject-wise.

A type of business or area of study is a field. All the subjects you study in school are different
fields of study. Baseball players field a ball, and you need nine players to field a team. All the
horses in a race are the field. Your field of vision is what you can see. Researchers go into the
field to collect data — for an education researcher, that’s a school. Most fields are specific
areas of one sort or another.
