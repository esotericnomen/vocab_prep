When something is deducible, it follows logically from a general principle, meaning you can figure
it out by working through it. Your school admits only geniuses? You've been admitted to your school?
It's deducible that you're a genius.

Something deducible is able to be deduced. Both words include the Latin roots meaning from (de-) and
lead (ducere).  So the deducible conclusion is one you're led to â&euro;&rdquo; by means of
reasoning â&euro;&rdquo; from a general principle. You might learn from experts the general
principle that all goats love to eat grass. You've got a pet goat in your backyard. It's deducible
that you'd better find some grass for your goat.
