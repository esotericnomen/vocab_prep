When you're casually talking about a man or a boy, you can call him a guy. It's an informal way to
refer to a person, especially a male.

A hundred years ago, you may have called your best friend a fellow or a chap. These days, you're
more likely to refer to him as a guy, and it's not uncommon to call a group of people guys, even if
some of them are women: Are you guys ready to go swimming? The word comes from Guy Fawkes, who
famously plotted to blow up Parliament in 1605 and is still burned in effigy yearly on the British
Guy Fawkes Day.
