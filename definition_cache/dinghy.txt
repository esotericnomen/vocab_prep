A long journey by sea requires a large ship, but if you’re out for an afternoon on the pond, you
may want to take the dinghy, a small boat.

A dinghy, pronounced DING-ee, is a lifeboat found on board of a ship in case of emergency, but it
can also be a rowboat used for fishing or just relaxing out on the water. The unusual spelling of
this word reflects its exotic origins, in the Hindi word ḍiṅgī. Be sure to remember to include
the silent “h” when you spell dinghy.
