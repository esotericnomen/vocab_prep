Fatuous means lacking intelligence. When your mother outlaws calling your brother stupid, use
fatuous instead.

Fatuous derives from the Latin fatuus meaning foolish. It sounds like it should have something to do
with being fat, but it actually has no relation to size. Fatuus itself comes from a root that also
gave us debate and this might be a good way to remember it. You want to debate someone who's
fatuous, because they are unintelligent, silly and even a bit conceited, so they probably won't be
very persuasive debaters. Just don't call them fatuous to their face. Even if they don't know what
it means, it's just not nice!
