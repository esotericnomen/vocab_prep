Have you ever cut out a bunch of pictures from magazines and pasted them together to make a big
picture? If you have, you have made a collage.

Collage came to English through French from the Greek word for glue, kolla, about 100 years ago. A
collage is not only made from magazine pictures. In the world of fine art, it refers to a work made
with various small objects sometimes with paint sometimes without. The word can also be used to mean
a collection of different things. If it's very loud in your house, you might come home to a collage
of sounds from the dog, the TV, your mom on the phone and your brother on the guitar. Years after
you graduate, high school might just seem like a collage of memories.
