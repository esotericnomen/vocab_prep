When you immure someone or something, you put it behind a wall, as in a jail or some other kind of
confining space.

You may recognize the -mur- in immure as the root for wall, as in mural, which is a painting on a
wall, or intramural, literally inside the walls, as, for instance, the walls of a school
Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; intramural sports are played among teams from the same school. You don't need a jail
to immure someone. Rapunzel was immured in her tower. At the end of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet,
the lovers are immured in the tomb.
