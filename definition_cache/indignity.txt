An indignity is something embarrassing. An indignity is usually something that happens to us rather
than something we do ourselves.

As you might guess from that negative prefix in-, an indignity is a word that takes dignity (or
self-esteem) away. If you find a fly in your soup, that's an indignity Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; not to
mention protein. If you're making a speech and you realize your fly is open, that's a major
indignity. Many people find waiting in line a long time to be an indignity. When you say This is an
indignity! you're really saying, I'm better than this, and I shouldn't have to deal with it.
Needless to say, life is full of indignities.
