Did you know Memorial Day Weekend is the biggest horticultural event of the year? It's the time many
people plant their flower and vegetable gardens. The adjective horticultural describes anything
related to gardening.

The Latin word for garden is hortus and cultura means planting and cultivation. You might be
familiar with the word horticulture as a formal way to describe the science of growing plants of all
kinds. Horticultural is just the adjective form of that word. If you√¢&euro;&trade;re headed to a
plant show over the weekend, to impress your gardening club you could say you are attending a
horticultural event.
