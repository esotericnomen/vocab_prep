Picture the confident, maybe even arrogant way a pirate, a cowboy, or even a rapper might stroll
around. That style of walking is called a swagger.

Swagger can also be used as a verb. After you ace a test you might swagger down the hall feeling
pretty full of yourself. In verb form it can also refer to more aggressive behavior like bullying or
intimidating others. Hopefully you wouldn√¢&euro;&trade;t swagger down the hall doing that though!
