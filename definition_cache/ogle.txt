When you ogle someone, you look at them with love or desire in mind. And if you're a cartoon
character, you might also be drooling.

Though it's most often used to refer to the way people gaze at each other, the verb ogle can also be
used when talking about any object of desire Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; like when you ogle those designer jeans
or that red Ferrari. The word comes from the 1680s German word oeglen, meaning look at. Men are
known to ogle women much more frequently than women ogle men. Ever seen a scene in a movie where a
pretty lady walks into a bar and all the men turn on their bar stools to watch her pass by? That's
classic ogling.
