Arid is so dry that nothing will grow. Death Valley in California features an arid climate, which is
why it's called Death Valley and not Life Valley.

Arid can also mean terribly dull or lifeless. A textbook about the climate of Death Valley might be
called arid if it's written in an uninteresting way. Just like you wouldn't want to live in an arid
climate, you wouldn't want to sit through an arid performance of the film-turned-musical, Some Like
it Hot.
