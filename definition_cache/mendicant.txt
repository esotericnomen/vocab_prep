People who live off begging can be called mendicants. However, you probably wouldn't call your kids
mendicants, even though they beg you for stuff, because the word mendicant also implies extreme
poverty.

The noun mendicant can also refer to a man belonging to a religious order, such as the Franciscan
Friars Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; who do not own personal property but live together in a monastery and survive
off alms donated by others. As an adjective, mendicant describes someone who lives such an
existence.
