Passive means inactive and is used in grammar, chemistry, or sticking it to the man. With verbs,
you're advised to avoid the passive voice, something passive in chemistry isn't reacting, and
passive resistance is a way to protest peacefully.

When you're passive, you don't participate much and you're not very emotional. In chemistry, passive
means to be unreactive except under special or extreme conditions; inert. Gandhi used the term
passive resistance in the mid-twentieth century to describe the nonviolent approach Indians should
use in their quest to become an independent nation.
