A galaxy is a collection of stars and planets that are held together by gravity. In a galaxy, the
celestial bodies rotate around a central object.

The Earth's galaxy is known as the Milky Way. Our solar system, made up of the Sun and the planets
that encircle it, is a tiny part of that galaxy. A galaxy can also refer to a gathering of a lot of
sparkly people â&euro;&ldquo;â&euro;&ldquo; like celebrities or sports stars. What gravity holds
this galaxy together? Usually cameras.
