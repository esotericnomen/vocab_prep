Innocence means you’ve done nothing wrong.  You’ve broken no laws, committed no sins, and are
not guilty of any morally evil act.  Well done.

In a courtroom, a defendant might announce their innocence, claiming they did not commit whatever
crime they’re accused of.  Innocence is very important in many religions, where your moral purity
decides what happens to your soul after you die.  The word comes from the Latin innocentia, which
means “not harming” and someone with innocence will not harm themselves or others, at least not
on purpose.  Remember that there are no ss in innocence, so spell it with two cs.
