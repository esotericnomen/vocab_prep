Perhaps you avoid babysitting your baby brother because you're worried that if he starts to cry, you
won’t be able to console him or make him feel better. Or maybe you just hate changing diapers.

You usually try to console someone by providing encouragement and offering solace. Others try to
console themselves with tubs of ice cream. From the Latin word consolari, meaning “to comfort,”
the noun console can also describe a central control panel. In an automobile, the controls for both
the radio and air-conditioning are in the same center console.
