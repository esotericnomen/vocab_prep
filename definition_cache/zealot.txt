The hamburger zealot was so fanatical about his burgers that he camped outside his favorite fast-
food joint for hours every morning, waiting for it to open. And he would never put mustard on them,
only ketchup.

The original zealots were a group of first-century Jews who were absolutely determined to overthrow
Roman rule in Palestine. Today, anyone who is goes overboard in their zeal, or enthusiasm, for a
particular cause, a religion, a sports team, or a charitable organization Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; can be
called a zealot. The coffee lover was a zealot regarding where his coffee was grown, who grew it,
and how it was roasted.
