If you notice that every time your friend Sarah comes over, all your binder clips and pens
disappear, it may be that your friend is a kleptomaniac.

If you’ve ever known a kleptomaniac, it won’t surprise you to learn that the word kleptomaniac
has origins that trace back to the Greek words for “thief” and “madness.” A kleptomaniac has
a mental disorder that compels the person to steal. Unlike a shoplifter, who will steal an item he
or she wants or needs, a kleptomaniac steals for the thrill of stealing, often taking items that
have little or no value.
