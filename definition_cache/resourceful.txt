If you are interviewing employees for your new pet store, you may want to ask if they are
resourceful. If they are, it means they are good at problem solving, and this could come in very
handy.

Think of resourceful people as â&euro;&oelig;full of resources,â&euro;? or tools for coming up
with solutions. They adapt well to new or difficult situations and they are able to think
creatively. For example, if a snake gets loose in the pet store, a resourceful person will be able
to figure out how to lure it back into its cage again.
