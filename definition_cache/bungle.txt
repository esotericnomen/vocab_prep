Saying the wrong thing at the wrong time, dropping something, tripping and falling: these are some
classic bungles — and they’re always embarrassing.

Bungles are bummers, it’s true.  Ever said something awkward in front of a grandparent or dropped
a cake on someone’s lap?  Those are bungles — accidents that make you blush. Bungle can also be
used as a verb when someone acts like a fool or simply messes everything up, as in “The teacher
bungled her lecture because she left her notes at home,” or “My bungling dad fell into the punch
bowl.  Again.”
