The adjective lunar is used to describe something that is related to the moon. If you like
astronomy, you probably enjoy lunar eclipses, when the Earth casts its shadow on the moon.

Lunar comes from the Latin word luna, meaning moon. The Roman goddess of the moon is called Luna
(Selene in Greek mythology). There are lunar eclipses, a lunar calendar, lunar tides, and lunar
orbits. Maybe you want to be the first live-in chef on a lunar space station. You can also hear
lunar in the word lunatic Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; they used to think insanity was related to the cycles of
the moon.
