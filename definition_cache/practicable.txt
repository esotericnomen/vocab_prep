Something that is practicable is something that can be reasonably done. Look at the word within the
word, practice, plus the suffix -able, and you have something that is able to be put into practice,
or practicable.

Practicable is an adjective built from the word practice and can thus be traced to the Medieval
Latin verb practicare and the Medieval French pratiquer, both of which meant to practice. With the
addition of a c to remind us of practice, the French praticable, able to be put into practice,
became the English practicable.
