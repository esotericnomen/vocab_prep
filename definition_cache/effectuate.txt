To effectuate is to produce a result or make something happen. Effectuating accomplishes things.

Things that have an effect make something happen: they're significant in some way. Similarly, to
effectuate is to cause something to happen or set it up so something can happen. A doctor who
effectuates a cure has found a cure. A general who effectuates an attack has made the attack happen.
Some people think computers effectuate a short attention span, meaning the short attention span is
caused by computers. Effectuating is about cause and effect.
