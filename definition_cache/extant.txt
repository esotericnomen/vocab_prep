Use the adjective extant to describe old things that are still around, like your extant diary from
third grade or the only extant piece of pottery from certain craftspeople who lived hundreds of
years ago.

Extant is the opposite of extinct: it refers to things that are here — they haven't disappeared or
been destroyed. Use extant to describe things that it may be surprising to learn are still around
— you wouldn't say jeans you bought last year are extant, but a pair of jeans worn by Marilyn
Monroe back in the 1950s? Definitely extant.
