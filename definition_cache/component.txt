It's the Ikea curse: You spend four hours figuring out how to piece together your new furniture,
only to be left with one random component, or part, that doesn't seem to fit anywhere.

It's not surprising that component is related to a Latin word that means to put together. You simply
can't put something together without all of the correct components. Technically speaking, a
component is an element of a system or a part of a machine. But a component can also be a factor or
ingredient, such as the components of a decision or the components of a really good chocolate cake.
