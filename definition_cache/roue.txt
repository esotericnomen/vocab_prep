You can describe a smooth-talking, no-good man as a roue. You could also call him a lady's man, a
rake, or a Lothario.

This one deserves a full etymology: it's French, a participle of rouer, to break on the wheel, and
it's also the name first applied to the profligate companions of the Duc d'OrlĂŠans. So in other
words, a roue is a really bad dude. Roue is not common in conversation but that didn't stop Oscar
Hammerstein from lyricizing it in The Sound of Music: Eager young lads and roues and cads / Will
offer you food and wine.
