Chances are that if the tail-wagging dog that just appeared on your doorstep is also foaming at the
mouth and chewing on your welcome mat, it's rabid and you should back away slowly; no petting for
this infectious pup.

While you've likely heard it used to describe an animal infected by rabies, rabid (derived from the
Latin verb rabere be mad, rave) can also dramatically describe a person exhibiting fanatical,
extremely enthusiastic, or raging behavior. That guy who nearly knocked you off the stands at the
football game with his energetic fist-pumping and then was later kicked out for getting into a fight
with another fan? Rabid on both counts.
