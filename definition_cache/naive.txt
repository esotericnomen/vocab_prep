No one likes being called naive, since it means you lack sophistication or street smarts.

A person who is too trusting can be criticized for being overly naive: You're so naive, you think
that e-mail from the Nigerian prince is really going to make you a million dollars! Naive shares the
same root as native, and originally meant natural or not artificial. It can still be used in a more
positive meaning when describing a charming lack of artificiality, as in the naive style of folk art
made by an untrained painter.
