The most common example of an infusion you are likely to encounter in your daily life is your
morning cup of coffee. An infusion is the creation of a new substance by steeping another substance
in a liquid, usually water.

Infusion is often misused with transfusion, which has a slightly different meaning.  A transfusion,
as in a blood transfusion, is the simple addition of one substance to another, without the creation
of something new. But a drip feed of medicine, for example, is technically an infusion as it alters
the state of the blood. See, you√¢&euro;&trade;re halfway to becoming a doctor (or at least a
linguist) simply by reading this site.
