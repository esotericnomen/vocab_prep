When you premeditate, you are planning ahead. While most people associate this word with crime,
let's hope you can think of a better reason to premeditate — like buying groceries before a storm.

When you meditate, you think deeply. The prefix pre- means “before,” so to premeditate means to
think about a situation before you’ve jumped into it. If you’ve ever cooked a meal, you’ve
premeditated the ingredients you need to get started. In a courtroom you’ll hear about
premeditated murder, which means the accused killer planned out his crime and it wasn’t a crime of
passion. Premeditating can be a good thing, but not when it involves murder.
