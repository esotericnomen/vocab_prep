When you solve a mathematical problem, you compute the answer. To compute is to calculate, either
literally or figuratively.

Computers do the math for you, faster than humans ever can. You'll often hear someone say that
something does not compute. This means it doesn't add up, it doesn't make sense. You might compute
how long it will take you to get to school or the likelihood that your mother will let you stay out
late.
