After you lose a loved one, often you're gripped with a fear of evanescence, or the rapid fading
from sight or memory of that person.

Evanescence comes from the Latin evanescere meaning disappear, vanish. Something that possesses
qualities of evanescence, has a quality of disappearing or vanishing.  The evanescence of a shooting
star makes it hard to catch -- it's there one moment and gone the next.  Evanescence is a word
typically used to describe an event that fades from sight or memory, or sometimes the fleeting
quality of worldly success.
