You know you've hit it big, when you earn acclaim, or enthusiastic approval. And when you have
achieved critical acclaim, even the grouchy critics approve of you.

The word acclaim comes from the Latin word acclamare, which means to cry out. So it only makes sense
that the verb acclaim means to offer enthusiastic praise or applause. The book was critically
acclaimed, but most of the students found it to be stupefyingly boring.
