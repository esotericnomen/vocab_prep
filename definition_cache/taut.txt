Taut means tight, not slack. The tightrope ought to be taut and not dangling down by the lion cage.

It sounds like the word taught and means stretched tight, like a rope, muscles, or even nerves. It's
nice to have a taut body with tight muscles, but not so great to have a taut mind Ã¢&euro;&rdquo;
tightly wound and tense. The Olympic gymnast's taut body was something she worked hard for, but she
gave a taut reply to reporters who asked her so many questions about her past, which she wished to
keep a secret. Taut is derived from an Old English word, meaning basically to pull. If you're
fishing, you're happy when your line becomes taut, because there's probably a fish pulling at it. Or
an old boot.
