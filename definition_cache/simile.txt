Use the noun simile when describing a comparison between two fundamentally different things, such
as: His voice was smooth, like butter in a warm pan.

A simile (pronounced SIM-uh-lee) is a comparison that usually uses the words like or as: Me without
a mic is like a beat without a snare, rapped Lauryn Hill in the song How Many Mics. The word comes
from similus, a Latin word meaning the same. A simile is different from a metaphor, in which the
comparison is less explicit, as in Shakespeare's line All the world's a stage.
