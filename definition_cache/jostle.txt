The verb jostle describes being bumped and pushed in a horde of people â€” or doing the bumping,
like those at a concert who jostle their way to the front, and the people jostled out of their spots
when the newcomers arrive.

Jostle describes both what someone does, like an impatient person who jostles other people out of
his way on a crowded bus or subway car, and what happens to those victims: They may have their bags
and cups of hot coffee jostled out of their hands by the impatient one's pushing and shoving. When
you say the word jostle remember to shove the t out of the way because it's silent: JOSS-ul.
