Use the adjective collected to describe a person who stays cool and calm, even under pressure.

There are certain people who always seem completely self-possessed and unflappable no matter what is
going on around them. You can describe these people as collected. If a kid throws up on the school
bus and the driver is unruffled, he is collected. A confident, poised trapeze artist is also
collected. If you're upset, you might say, I need to collect myself, and once you have calmed
yourself, you are collected.
