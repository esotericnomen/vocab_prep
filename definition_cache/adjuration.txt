Use the noun adjuration to describe the serious, whole-hearted way you begged your parents to let
you have a puppy when you were little.

During your adjuration to get that puppy, did you say, I swear I'll feed it and walk it every day! I
swear to clean up after it!? If so, you were really in tune with the origin of adjuration, the Latin
ad- or to and jurare, swear Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; in the sense of taking an oath of honesty. Adjuration
involves both begging and promising.
