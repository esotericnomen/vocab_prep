If the mere thought of a burrito with sour cream in it turns your stomach, you could say that you
despise sour cream. You loathe it, abhor it, hate it, and think it's vile.

Despise dates all the way back to the Latin word despicare, which combines de down with specere to
look at. So if you look down your nose at something, you could say you despise it. Nowadays the word
gets used a lot to describe things people really, really dislike, too. Note how similar in meaning
and spelling despise is to Sylvester the cartoon cat's old favorite catchphrase despicable.
Despicable means something worth of being despised.
