Perdition is mainly a religious concept from Christianity that means hell or eternal damnation.
Perdition doesn't sound like a lot of fun.

If you hear someone say the fires of perdition, they're talking about the fires of Hell. Perdition
refers to hell, and especially the religious idea of eternal damnation: suffering for an endless
period of time after death. You can also use this word for a more earthly kind of suffering. Just as
people say I'm in hell! when they're unhappy, you could say someone in a bad situation is caught in
perdition. When you see the word perdition, think Suffering!
