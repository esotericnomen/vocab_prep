Treachery is trickery, cheating, and deceit, like the treachery of your former friend who only stuck
around until he stole your girlfriend and turned the whole grade against you.

The noun treachery comes from the Old French word trechier, “to cheat.” Many a corrupt
government or dictator has been accused of treachery: deceiving the people and abusing their trust.
Greed is a common cause of treachery — with the promise of wealth, people can be tempted to betray
their country and even their loved ones, as new celebrities find out when their best friends sell
embarrassing secrets to the tabloids.
