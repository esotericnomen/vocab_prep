At an archaeological dig, the matrix is the soil surrounding the site. Biologists use the phrase
nuclear matrix to refer to the material left behind after DNA is extracted from a cell's nucleus. A
matrix is an environment or structure in which something originates or develops.

Matrix, related to the Latin word for mother, originally meant pregnant animal or breeding female
and was later generalized to mean womb. Today, matrix includes any nurturing or supportive setting
or substance usually within the fields of math and the sciences Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; except in the
cinematic trilogy starring Keanu Reeves, of course. Matrixes is an acceptable plural form, but you
can use matrices if you want to show off your knowledge of Latin noun endings.
