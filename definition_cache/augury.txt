Is your team losing 15-0? Has your girlfriend just slapped your face? Dude, these are auguries â€”
signs of how things are going to work out in the future. And these two examples don't look good.

In fact, not every augury is an ill omen, as the common phrase augurs well for the future suggests,
but more often than not, it seems, an augury is a sign that the future will be none too rosy.
Auguries are signs of what's to come, and it's wise not to ignore them.
