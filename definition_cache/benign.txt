Someone or something that is benign is gentle, kind, mild, or unharmful: a benign soul wouldn't hurt
a fly.

Benign describes a range of qualities, all of them positive. When talking about a person, it means
gentle. In reference to weather or climate, it means mild. In some other contexts, it simply means
not harmful; you might speak of a benign tumor or an environmentally benign chemical. The word comes
from a Latin root benignus meaning well born, but the implied meaning is kind or pleasant
Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; it's hard to get mad at someone who has a benign disposition.
