The adjective verisimilar describes something appears to be true or real, but may not be. If you
want to impress your friends, remark on the verisimilar portrait of lost love in that foreign film
you all went to see.

Verisimilar comes from Latin. You’ll notice the word similar at the end, which means “like.”
Veri- comes from the word veritas, meaning “truth.” Something that is verisimilar is “like
true,” but is not necessarily actually true. A painting of your uncle Marvin, for example, might
be so good that it’s verisimilar, in that it almost looks like Uncle Marvin is standing right
there — but he isn't.
