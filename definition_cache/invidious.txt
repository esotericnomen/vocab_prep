Something can be described as invidious when it is resentful, discriminatory or envious, as in: Fred
was angered by the invidious gossip about his divorce being spread by his ex-wife's allies.

The adjective invidious is used to describe an act, thought, opinion or critique that is full of ill
will or prejudice.  It comes from a Latin word that means hostile.  When the captain of a
cheerleading squad says nasty things about an opposing cheer captain's new party dress, those are
invidious comments.
