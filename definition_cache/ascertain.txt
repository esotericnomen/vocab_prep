Ascertain is a verb that means to find out something. You might have to go to the bank to ascertain
if there is any money in your account.

This is a formal word that often applies to discovering the facts or truth about something through
examination or experimentation. Information that is ascertained is certain beyond a doubt. If you
want a less formal synonym, use discover.
