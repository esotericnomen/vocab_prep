If doing something usually results in punishment, but you do it with impunity, you will not be
punished for the deed. Students are not allowed to chew gum in school, but teachers do it with
impunity. Not fair!

The noun, impunity, comes from the Latin roots im- not plus poena punishment, a root which has also
produced the word pain. Impunity, then, is the freedom from punishment or pain. If someone has
committed a punishable offense but does not have to fear punishment, he or she does it with
impunity. Cybercriminals operate with impunity from some Eastern European countries.
