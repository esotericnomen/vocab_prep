Saying offensive things about God or religion is blasphemy. Blasphemy can be used for offensive
ideas in other areas too.

If you're saying something bad about a god, or taking the Lord's name in vain, or questioning a
religious institution in any way, you could be accused of blasphemy Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; insulting
something sacred. You can use this word in a lot of other ways too. At a meeting of conservatives, a
liberal idea could be considered blasphemy (and vice versa). You might even jokingly cry Blasphemy!
if a friend said your favorite ice cream flavor stinks.
