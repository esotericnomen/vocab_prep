Incredulity is the state of not believing. I greeted the stranger's story about needing bus fare
with incredulity. I just don't believe you, I said. The bit about your diabetic cat was a little
over the top.

In Latin, credere means to believe. You'll see it at the roots of creed statement of belief,
credible believable, credulous a person who readily believes, and incredulous a person who doesn't.
