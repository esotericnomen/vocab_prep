If your eyes are open but you're not fully awake and in control, you may be in trance. Someone might
have hypnotized you, or just a glimpse of your latest heartthrob might send you into a trance.

Trances don’t have to be magic or mysterious — when you avoid facing your problems head-on,
you’re creating your own trance. President Obama once said, speaking of America's decades-long
dependence on foreign oil, We cannot keep going from shock when prices go up, to trance when they go
back down. He meant that when prices rise, we all complain, but when they fall, we forget we ever
had a problem and refuse to change a thing.
