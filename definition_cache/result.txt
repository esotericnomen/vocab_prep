A result is something that occurs as a consequence of some action. The result of your practical joke
is a puddle of water on the floor and a lump on your cousin's head where the bucket hit him.

A result is also the answer to some problem, especially one obtained by calculation or
experimentation. The result you get for a math problem will be wrong if you add when you should
multiply. The verb result means to follow as an outcome of some action. If you forget to book a room
in advance, it will result in your having to stay at the hotel by the airport instead of one by the
beach.
