If someone asks you what’s on your docket for the day, she really just wants to know what you’re
doing today. Likewise, if someone complains that he has a full docket, he’s saying that he is very
busy.

While docket, as used above, is another word for agenda or schedule, it is most commonly used to
mean the calendar for a court of law, specifically, the schedule of pending cases. In the United
Kingdom, a docket is a list or label affixed to the outside of a package detailing what is inside.
