A culprit is a person who does something wrong, like committing a crime. When your wallet got stolen
out of your pocket, there was a culprit to blame in the crowd.

The word culprit comes from the Anglo French words cul prit, a contraction of culpable, which means
deserving blame. A culprit isn't always a person; it can be anything that caused something bad to
happen Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; even a sock left on the steps can be a culprit if it makes you slip and fall.
Don't confuse culprit with scapegoat, which is a person or thing that gets blamed for something it
didn't do.
