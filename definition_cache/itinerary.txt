An itinerary is your travel plan â€” where you will go and when you will be there.

If you make plans to fly to Paris from Beijing or take a train to Chicago from Mexico City, you will
need an itinerary. That means you will have a plan that displays how you will get from point to
point in your travels and when you will be at each point. This word comes from the Middle English
itinerarius and is defined as being about a journey. Itineraries can be really useful because if you
give your mother yours, she will always know where you are!
