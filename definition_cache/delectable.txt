Something delectable is extremely delicious or appealing. Nothing tastes better at the end of a meal
than an array of delectable desserts and pastries!

Don't let the de- at the beginning of delectable fool you. There is nothing negative about this
word. Related to delicious through the Latin word for delight, if something is delectable, it is
very tasty! Maybe you mom has promised you a delectable dinner of lobster and steak for your
birthday meal? Occasionally, you will hear a man or woman described as delectable. That means that
the person is so attractive, he or she looks good enough to eat!
