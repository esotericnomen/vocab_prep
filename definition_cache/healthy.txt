Healthy means having good health. It's the opposite of sick, but also can mean doing well in a
general sense. You can have a healthy attitude, or be served a healthy portion of food.

Health is one of the most fundamental human concerns. The ubiquitous How are you? is often asking
after a person's health. To remember healthy think of the proverb: Early to bed and early to rise
makes a man healthy and wealthy and wise.
