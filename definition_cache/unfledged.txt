Something that is unfledged is young and inexperienced, such as an unfledged short story writer who
has great style but whose stories have plots that are impossible to follow.

The word unfledged can be used literally to describe a baby bird that doesn’t yet have feathers
and can’t fly or leave the nest. It can also describe a person who is inexperienced or not yet
completely developed. An actor just learning his craft could be called unfledged. It can also be
used to describe ideas that are still developing, such as an unfledged plan — there are goals but
all the steps for reaching them aren't in place.
