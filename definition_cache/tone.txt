The tone, or pitch, of your voice can be worried, stern, or melodic, and but it should be a hushed
around a sleeping baby, or else you'll hear the baby's very unhappy tone when it wakes up.

The word tone often refers to sound, as in music, but it can also be used to describe the atmosphere
of a place â&euro;&rdquo; its flavor or spirit â&euro;&rdquo; or the shades of meaning in a work
that might reveal the larger intentions of an author or actor. If your body has tone its muscular
structure is strong and appears well defined.
