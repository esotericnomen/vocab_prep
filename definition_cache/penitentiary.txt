A penitentiary is a prison for big-time criminals convicted of big-time crimes. Commit a serious
crime like a murder and you won't just go to jail; you'll be sent to the penitentiary.

Penitentiary comes from the Latin paenitentia, meaning repentance. A penitentiary is a place you are
sent to make repentance for a crime committed. Penitentiary can also be used as an adjective to
describe something done to show penance, as in the penitentiary scarlet A on Hester Prynne's chest.
In the Roman Catholic Church, a penitentiary is a priest who administers the sacrament of penance,
or hears people's confessions.
