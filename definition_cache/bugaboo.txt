Use the noun bugaboo to describe something that causes worry, like the bugaboo of having three tests
on the same day at school.

Bugaboo is also another name for the creature known as the bogeyman, an imaginary monster that
children believe will hurt them or even take them away if they don't behave. Some usage experts
trace bugaboo to Scotland, where the now-obsolete word bogill meant goblin, bugbear. A bugbear, in
the 1580 coining of the word, was a demon that looked like a bear and ate small children.
