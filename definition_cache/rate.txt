When you pay a high rate, you pay a lot of money.  When you move at a high rate of speed, you go
fast.  If you are a judge at a contest, you rate the contestants.

It's interesting how one word can have different origins for different meanings. For example, the
noun rate, referring to amounts comes from the Latin rata, â&euro;&oelig;a fixed amount.â&euro;?
But the verb rate seems to come from the Scandinavian rata, to reject.  If the person you are dating
asks you to rate them against your previous partners, you might change the subject at a high rate of
speed.
