Often used to describe the ability of sperm to swim, motility is anything's ability to move or get
around. His sperm's motility was just one of the factors in the couple's fertility.

An easy way to remember that motility means the ability to move oneself without help is the mot- at
the root of the word. It's the same root as that found in motor, which is, of course, the engine
that drives a car. If you've got good motility, then you're motor is working. After her accident,
her friends and family were understandably concerned about the boxer's motility. Would she be able
to walk on her own again? Motility is something you tend to take for granted. Until you sprain an
ankle.
