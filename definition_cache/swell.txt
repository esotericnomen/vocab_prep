To swell is to expand or grow larger. If your brother's face started to swell after he ate lobster
for the first time, you'd probably guess that he's allergic to shellfish.

You can use the word swell to describe what happens to an injured body part, like a black eye that
swells up, or in a figurative way, to describe a feeling of fullness, like when your heart swells
with pride at your sister's big music performance. In the 1930s, swell became a popular slang term
meaning great or excellent. But it also can describe a wealthy, elegant person, like a group of
swells at a fancy restaurant.
