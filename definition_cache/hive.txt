A hive can be a home for bees. It’s also a whole bunch of something moving around — like a hive
of eager students — which is related to the fact that so many bees live in a hive.

The word hive is most recognizable as a place where bees live, but it can be a verb that means to
move together as one, like a swarm of bees. It can also describe storing a lot of things in a
confined space, the way bees are packed into a hive. You might hive your stamp collection in boxes
in the attic, but if bees have built a hive in the eaves you won't be able to get to them.
