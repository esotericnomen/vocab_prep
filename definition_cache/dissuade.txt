When you dissuade someone, you convince that person not to do something: “When Caroline saw
Peter's broken leg, she tried to dissuade him going on the ski trip.”

Remember the meaning of dissuade by comparing it to its more common relative persuade. The suade
part that both words share has origins in the Latin root suadēre, meaning “to urge.” In the
case of persuade, the prefix per- means “thoroughly,” intensifying “to urge” and giving
persuade its meaning of “to convince.” Think of dissuade as the opposite of persuade: the prefix
dis- reverses the action of the root, giving the meaning of not urging, in other words, convincing
someone NOT to do something.
