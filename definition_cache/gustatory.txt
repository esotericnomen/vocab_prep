If you want to improve the gustatory appeal of a grapefruit, you might add a spoonful of sugar.
Gustatory is an adjective that refers to tasting or the sense of taste.

You may be tempted to link gustatory with the word gust, meaning a quick, strong rush of wind.
However, gustatory has its roots in the Latin gustare, meaning to taste, while gust can be traced
back to the Old Norse gustr, meaning to to gush. But if a gust of wind brings with it the savory
aroma of a nearby backyard barbecue, you might find yourself licking the air in gustatory
frustration.
