If you try to avoid waste by reusing and repurposing items that most people would throw away, your
frugality will save you money.

Some people use this word interchangeably with cheapness, but cheapness is an unwillingness to
spend, while frugality is an unwillingness to waste. People who show frugality often find ways of
making things useful that others do not. Even after the Depression ended, those who lived through it
maintained their frugality, using old t-shirts for rags and washed-out cottage cheese containers
instead of Tupperware.
