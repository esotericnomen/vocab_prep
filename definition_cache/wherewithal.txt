If you have the wherewithal to do something, it means you've got what you need to make it happen.

Another word for wherewithal is resources, which can mean money, energy, support, or some other
necessary means. If you have the wherewithal to build a new house, it can mean you have the
knowledge and patience to do it yourself, or that you've got the money to pay someone to build it
for you. The word combines where and withal -- a now-obscure word that means in addition. Don't
forget to spell it with only one l.
