Special means better than ordinary. Like the self-portrait you lovingly painted as a surprise for
your sweetie's birthday, something special is distinct, and surpasses the norm.

Something special is looked upon with affection, surpasses expectations, or has a particular role.
It can also be a featured attraction or limited-run occurrence — like when there's a special on
television or a special on cheese at the store. Ray Charles said, “Love is a special word, and I
use it only when I mean it. You say the word too much and it becomes cheap.” Take this sweet
crooner’s advice and don’t wear out special sentiments.
