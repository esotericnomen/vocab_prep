A debut is a first appearance, a launch, or public introduction. So before you make your big debut
at the office, check and make sure you don't have spinach in your teeth.

Perhaps you’ve heard of debutantes making their official debut into society, or actresses and
actors making their debut on stage. A fun fact: debut and premiere are often thought to be
interchangeable, but they’re not. A debut, as you now know, is a first public appearance. But a
premiere, while also a “first,” isn't necessarily live. When a movie opens or an interview is
broadcast for the first time, they're called premieres.
