If you get a letter stamped confidential, that means you're not supposed to tell anyone else what it
says. It's private and you're not supposed to blab about it.

Confidential suggests that you're being let in on a secret Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; as in Kitchen
Confidential, the title of a book by Anthony Bourdain, a famous chef, in which he tells unappetizing
stories about the restaurant industry. If you confide in someone, you are trusting him or her with
confidential or secret information. Choose your confidants wisely!
