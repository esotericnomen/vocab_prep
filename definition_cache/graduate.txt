To graduate means to successfully complete your schooling, to become a graduate. When you graduate
from high school, you become a high school graduate and congratulations are in order.

A graduate is someone who has received a degree from a school. As a verb graduate refers to the act
of receiving this degree “I plan to graduate from college in the spring,” or the act of giving a
degree “I want to graduate all of my students.” In a scientific sense, graduate can mean to
calibrate for fine adjustments. To make a thermometer, you have to graduate it by degrees so it
displays a range of temperatures.
