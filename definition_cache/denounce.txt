To denounce is to tattle, rat out, or speak out against something. When you stand on your desk and
tell the class that your partner is cheating, you denounce him or her.

The prefix de- means down, as in destroy or demolish (tear down). Add that to the Latin root
nuntiare, meaning announce, and destroy plus announce equals denounce. It's a word that shows up in
the headlines often, as a country might denounce a corrupt election. Politicians love to denounce
each other's shady doings, or denounce some underhanded activities of people in their party in order
to separate themselves. Denounce can also mean the official end of something, like a treaty.
