Describe a slow-moving river or a weak breeze or a listless manner with the slightly poetic
adjective, languid.

Languid comes from the Latin verb, languere to be weak or faint and is a somewhat literary word for
something that doesn't use much energy. If someone says goodbye to you with a languid wave of the
hand, there's not too much movement involved. You can describe yourself as languid when you have
that feeling of not being entirely awake Ã¢&euro;&rdquo;  kind of lazy in the mind.
