An ode is a kind of poem, usually praising something. A famous example is John Keats' Ode on a
Grecian Urn. Apparently, Keats was really into urns.

An ode is a form of lyric poetry â&euro;&rdquo; expressing emotion â&euro;&rdquo; and it's usually
addressed to someone or something, or it represents the poet's musings on that person or thing, as
Keats' ode tells us what he thought as he looked at the Grecian urn. The word ode comes from a Greek
word for song, and like a song, an ode is made up of verses and can have a complex meter.
