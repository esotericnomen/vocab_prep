Astral is starlike or having to do with stars. You may wear your hair in a spiky, astral style,
resembling the Statue of Liberty's crown.

Astrum is Latin for star, and it shows up in lots of familiar English words: astronomy, asteroid,
astrology, even in the name of a sports stadium, the Astrodome. Astral navigation, also called
celestial navigation, is the technique of finding your way by the stars. Consult your horoscope to
learn what the astral influences have in store for you.
