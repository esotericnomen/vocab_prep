Use the word, legacy, for something handed down from one generation to the next. A retiring company
president might leave a legacy of honesty and integrity.

Legacy comes from the Latin verb, legare to appoint by a last will, send as an ambassador.
Originally, the noun meant ambassador or envoy but soon shifted to mean the money and property a
person leaves behind in his will. Many university scholarships are funded by the legacies of former
students. In recent usage, political leaders are said to be concerned with their legacies, the
historically significant achievements of their tenure in office.
