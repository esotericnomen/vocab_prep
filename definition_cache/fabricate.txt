Do you like to construct mini airplanes from kits? Work on an assembly line? Piece together Ikea
furniture? Then you certainly know how to fabricate, or to put together, things.

While fabricate might mean the physical act of construction, it can also mean constructing a
falsehood. Watch out — those well versed in the art of fabrication might have an ulterior motive.
In the movies, the bad cops sometimes fabricate evidence to make the good guy look guilty. When you
tell the teacher the dog ate your homework, you’ve fabricated a pretty silly excuse. So if
you’re going to fabricate the truth, get some better material!
