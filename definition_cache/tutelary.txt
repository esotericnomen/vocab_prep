The adjective tutelary describes something that is supervising or guarding something else, like the
tutelary duties of a babysitter who makes sure the kids don't hurt themselves at the playground.

To correctly pronounce tutelary, say TOO-tuh-leh-ree. Tutelary comes from the Latin word tutus,
meaning watch over. You see this root in words like tutor and tutorial, which also involve watching
over, though in a more specific sense that applies primarily to instructing. Tutelary's suffix -ary
means having to do with. So something that is tutelary has to do with keeping watch, like the
tutelary presence of a parent supervising a child, or even a tutelary god in an ancient society.
