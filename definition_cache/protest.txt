A protest is a formal declaration of objection. When there are big meetings of powerful countries
and corporations, there are often protests staged in front of the meeting building, by people who
think that what's happening inside is wrong.

Protest is both a noun and a verb. You've probably seen news about protests, because people all over
the world organize them when they need to get a message across urgently. A protest doesn't have to
be on the world scale, however. You might protest against eating frozen pizza for the third night in
a row, and you've certainly seen a little kid protest against going to bed. When protest is
political, it's also known as dissent.
