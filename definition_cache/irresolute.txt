Irresolute describes someone who feels stuck. A decision must be made, a plan acted on, but the
irresolute person just doesn't know what to do.

Resolute describes certainty. When someone is resolute, things get done: plans are made and carried
out. But add the prefix ir to resolute and you get its opposite. An irresolute person isn't
necessarily a slacker â&euro;&rdquo; he or she just doesn't know what to do. Maybe it's confusion.
Maybe it's a matter of waiting for better information to come along. Either way, if someone is
irresolute, you'll need to be patient â&euro;&rdquo; or willing to nudge him or her into action.
