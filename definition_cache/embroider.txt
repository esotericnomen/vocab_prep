To embroider means to decorate with needlework. Picture your great grandmother's pillowcases or
Hester Prynne's famous scarlet letter A â€” both of those objects are probably embroidered.

To embroider refers to a type of ornamentation or needlework, but another usage of the word
embroider means to embellish the truth. For example, if a fisherman sitting on the dock tells you
about the 38 inch striped bass he almost caught this morning, he may have found a way to embroider
the truth.
