If you're engaged to get married, but suddenly fall in love with someone else, you have got yourself
in quite a predicament. A predicament is a difficult, confusing, and unpleasant situation.

The Greek word that predicament originally descends from means a state of being. Which makes sense
considering the words that sound like predicate are all about states of
beingâ&euro;&ldquo;â&euro;&ldquo;predict, or say what's going to happen in the future, and
predicate the second part of a sentence that's led by the verb. Think of predicament as an
unpleasant state of being.
