To clamber is to climb awkwardly. Hamlet's Ophelia was said to have been clambering on a weak branch
of a willow when she met her muddy death. It's never a good idea to clamber, let alone on weak
willow branches.

We associate the word clamber far more often with toddlers (than Shakespearean tragedy). Toddlers
are known for naturally clumsy, ill-coordinated movements we deem cute not foolish. Suitably enough,
the word comes from the delightful and long obsolete Middle English word clamb, meaning the past
tense of climb, a word that has all the happy logic of a toddler's imagination.
