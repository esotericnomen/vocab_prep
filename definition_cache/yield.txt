Yield has two meanings that seem quite different: an amount or to give way. The yield of the recipe
was twelve brownies. To avoid being tripped, Mary was forced to yield to the children on her way to
the brownie plate.

While these meanings seem quite different, they both essentially mean to give. The recipe gives
twelve brownies to those who follow it, and Mary is giving up her right to go first. Yield can also
mean the rate of return on an investment. A bond yields an interest rate of 2%, or gives an investor
$2.00 for every $100 invested.
