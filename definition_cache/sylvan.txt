The adjective sylvan refers to a shady, wooded area. The word suggests a peaceful, pleasant feeling,
as though you were far away from the noise of modern life.

As a noun, sylvan means a being that inhabits the woods. The Roman god of woods and fields was known
as Silvanus, sometimes also known as the half-man, half-goat sylvan called Pan.
Shakespeare√¢&euro;&trade;s character Puck, in A Midsummer Night's Dream, seems based on a sylvan,
and other authors used the image as well. The adjectival use of the Middle French word sylvain
evolved in the mid-16th century. The word is most often used today to describe an idyllic wooded
area.
