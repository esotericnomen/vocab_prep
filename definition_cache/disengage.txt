To disengage means to free or disentangle yourself or some object from another person or object. No,
it doesn't mean breaking off your engagement to your beloved — that's chickening out.

Does your mind wander when someone (your fiancé, for example) talks to you? Well, your mind can
disengage as well, that is, stop paying attention. Disengage has quite a formal, intellectual ring
to it, even if used about a situation as physical as two armies disengaging from combat. It's a
technical term, and faintly clinical; the kind of word frequently used by politicians and diplomats.
