The general sense of economy is careful management of resources such as money and materials, so as
not to waste them, but the more familiar reference is to a system of producing, distributing, and
consuming goods and services.

The word economy derives from Greek oikonomos manager of a household, from oikos house. The earliest
meaning of the adjective economical and the noun economics was also in connection with the
management of a household. The earliest mention of a nation's economy was in Thomas Hobbes'
Leviathan, an important work in the history of political economy.
