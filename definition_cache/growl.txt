To growl is to make a low, guttural, aggressive sound, like “grrrrrrrrrrr.” If you’ve ever
gotten too close to an angry dog, you’ve probably heard a growl.

A growl is not a friendly sound. Growls are low, rumbling snarls, and they usually mean Back off!
Dogs growl at people and animals they don’t like. Sometimes people growl when they speak in a low,
angry way. If you dine at a restaurant but don’t leave a tip, the waiter might growl at you.
Growling is best done though clinched teeth. If an animal or person is growling, stay away!
