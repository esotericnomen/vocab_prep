A buffalo, a goose, a grasshopper, and a stegosaurus sit down to eat dinner.  This isn’t a joke,
it’s an example of herbivorous creatures who exist on a diet of plant life only.

Herbivorous comes from the Latin word herba, which means “green plants,” and that’s what
herbivorous animals eat all the time: grass, leaves, and other plants.  Some massive and strong
animals actually have peaceful herbivorous eating habits, like gorillas and hippopotamuses.  The
opposite of herbivorous is carnivorous, which describes meat-eating beasts like lions, sharks,
crocodiles, and your uncle Marvin who eats nothing but steak all day long.
