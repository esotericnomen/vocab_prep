If you spend all day admiring yourself in reflective surfaces — mirrors, pools of water, the backs
of spoons — people may think you are conceited or vain.

If, to your horror, you have searched everywhere for a reflective surface but can't find one, you
have made a fruitless or vain search for a mirror. Vain is from Latin vanus empty, and in English it
originally meant lacking value or effect, futile; we still say a vain attempt using that sense, and
the phrase in vain means without success. Normally, though, vain means conceited, too proud of
oneself.  Carly Simon's line You're so vain, you probably think this song is about you is an
excellent illustration of this use.
