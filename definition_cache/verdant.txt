When something is green with plant life it's verdant, a word often used to idealize the countryside
with its verdant pastures or verdant hills.

Here's a trick for internalizing verdant's meaning: If you speak Spanish, thing of verde
Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; meaning green. If you speak French, think of vert. Both French and Spanish inherited
their words for green from Latin, in which green is viridis. Verdant also can mean grass-colored:
She wore a dress of verdant green.
