If an unpleasant meal has left you feeling grumpy and looking green, you're bilious in several
senses of the word. This adjective can mean both troubled by indigestion and irritable, and it can
also be used to suggest a sickly green shade.

The wonderfully descriptive word bilious comes from the root bile, which is a foul green fluid made
in the liver and stored in the gall bladder Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; a fact that helps us picture something
described as bilious as being really foul. Because of the connection with bile, we often refer to
something that's an ugly shade of green as being bilious. Of course, the word can also be more
kindly applied to someone who has a liver or gall bladder disorder.
