If you make bad decisions in the morning after drinking coffee, you might conclude that caffeine
tends to impair your judgment. When you impair something, you damage it or make it work poorly.

The root of the verb impair traces back to the Latin word pejorare, meaning “to make worse,” and
that’s still what happens if you impair something. Whether it’s communication, visibility, or
your marriage prospects, if you impair it, you make it worse. The word can be used for situations
that describe something that has deteriorated, such as “Snow continued to impair driving
conditions.”
