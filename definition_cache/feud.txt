A feud is a long-standing fight, often between two families. In Romeo and Juliet, Shakespeare
describes the lovers' long-feuding families, the Capulets and the Montagues.

Feuds do not have to be violent√¢&euro;&rdquo;what characterizes them is long-standing hostility.
Ethnic groups can sometimes be said to be feuding. Kids in school who refuse to sit at the same
lunch table over a period of years could describe their relationship as a feud.
