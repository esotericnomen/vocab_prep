When you want to keep all your options open, stay noncommittal. This means you say maybe and I'll
see if I can do that, rather than making promises to do specific things.

It’s pretty easy to figure out the meaning of noncommittal just by picking apart the word. The
non- prefix means “not.” And you see the word commit in noncommittal. So you know that the word
is going to have something to do with “not commit.” You might also recognize the suffix -al,
which is a tip-off that this word is an adjective that means not being willing to commit.
