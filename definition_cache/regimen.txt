A regimen is a systematic plan for some kind of therapy. If your doctor tells you to eat more
vegetables, cut out potato chips, exercise, and take vitamins, he is prescribing a regimen for
better health.

It's easy to confuse regimen with regime, which means a ruling government. Both words involve things
that you follow. If you wash your face twice a day, apply medicine to your acne, and use a special
lotion, that's your skin-care regimen. A skin-care regime would be armed dermatologists taking over
the government.
