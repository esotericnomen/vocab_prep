Calling something finite means it has an end or finishing point. Don't worry, it's a bad dentist
appointment but you have to remember that it's finite; you won't be doing it forever.

Most people are far more familiar with the word finite when they see it inside the word infinite, or
without end. Finite can be used for conceptual things like time, We have to get out of here, we only
have a finite amount of time, and for more tangible things like beans or dirt, We have to be careful
with the cooking, we only have a finite amount of fuel. You might want to think of things being
finito â&euro;&rdquo; a word that looks a lot like finite â&euro;&rdquo; to remember that it
means, with an end.
