At the cartooning contest, you could draw out your pen and draw a narwhal, and the competition could
still end in a draw. The meanings  of draw include to pull gently and to sketch and an even score.

The original meaning of draw comes from the Old English dragan, drag. This meaning is still common
today, like when you draw the curtains shut or when a horse draws a carriage through Central Park.
The most common way to use the verb draw is to mean produce an image using lines, which came from
the idea of drawing a pen or pencil across paper. Occasionally, draw gets confused with drawer, a
noun meaning a compartment that slides out.
