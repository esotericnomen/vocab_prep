It might take more than a scintilla of English vocabulary knowledge to know that scintilla means a
tiny bit of something.

Scintilla is a long word for describing a tiny thing. It comes sandwiched between the words a and of
in phrases like “a scintilla of doubt” or “not a single scintilla of evidence.” If you’re
uncertain of the pronunciation, remember: it rhymes with chinchilla and the c is silent, just like
in science. Similar words you can use to talk about tiny bits of something are iota, smidgen, speck,
and whit.
