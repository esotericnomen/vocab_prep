When you say “I wouldn't do it for all the tea in China!” you are talking about every single
leaf of tea in the entire country of China. That's a lot of tea.

When you talk about all of one thing, you mean the whole thing. When Shakespeare writes, in As You
Like It, “All the world's a stage,” he means the whole world. When I ask, “Did you eat all of
the pie?” I mean, “Is there a piece left for me?”. If you are all upset about something, you
are very upset; what's upset you has got a hold of you. Would some pie cheer you up?
