Is your homework in shreds and the dog chewing something? Then you can incriminate poor Fido for
eating your homework. To incriminate someone (or some dog) of a crime, is more than just accusing
them; it's offering some evidence they're guilty.

To incriminate someone is to show or prove their guilt with incriminating evidence. Some famous
historical examples of incriminating evidence: When President Nixon declared I am not a crook, those
pesky Watergate tapes suggested otherwise. Or when Lady Macbeth couldn't stop washing her imaginary
blood-stained hands? Hmmmm.... Pretty incriminating.
