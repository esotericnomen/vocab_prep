Inchoate means just beginning to form. You can have an inchoate idea, like the earliest flickers of
images for your masterpiece, or it can be a feeling, like the inchoate sense of anger toward your
new neighbor’s talking parrot.

Inchoate comes from a Latin word for beginning. When something is inchoate, although you don’t yet
understand what it is fully, you have a strong sense that it is indeed coming. It’s stronger than
the wisp of an idea that never turns into anything. But it’s hard to really find the language to
describe an inchoate idea. That’s the whole point: you don’t have the words for it yet!
