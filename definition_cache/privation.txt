If you're lacking the basic necessities of life — food, water, political freedom, and so on —
you're suffering from privation.

Privation has become a rather old-fashioned word, and when used now is often with irony: present day
privations are usually of the order of not having wireless Internet or video games. It's interesting
to compare privation with the similar word deprivation, which is used more commonly now. Deprivation
usually suggests that someone or something has actually caused the privation.
