If you clean your room of your own accord, you parents will be pleasedâ€”it means you did it without
having to be asked. They might even accord you an extra privilege. Warring nations make peace
accords.

A Honda Accord is a nice, agreeable car, and the word accord is all about agreement, or unity. If a
whole class begs with one accord to postpone a quiz for a day to allow more review, the teacher is
more likely to listen than if it was just one student asking.
