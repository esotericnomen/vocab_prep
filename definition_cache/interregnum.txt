Interregnum describes the period between the reigns of two leaders. If you're a rebel leader, you
may try to gain power during an interregnum.

Pronounce interregnum with the accent on the third syllable: in-ter-REG-num. It comes from Latin:
inter- means between and regnum means kingship, dominion, rule, realm. An interregnum can be marked
by no government at all, or it can refer to a different kind of leadership between two similar
regimes.
