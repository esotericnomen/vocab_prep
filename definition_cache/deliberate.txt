To deliberate means to carefully think or talk something through — it also means slow and
measured, the pace of this kind of careful decision making. If you chose deliberately, you make a
very conscious, well-thought-through choice.

The verb deliberate ends with an ate sound — at the end of a trial, after the evidence is
presented, the twelve members of a jury retreat to a room to deliberate, i.e., talk through the
trial and come to a verdict. The adjective deliberate ends with an it sound. If you walk with a
deliberate pace, you're slow and steady.
