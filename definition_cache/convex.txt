If something is bulging outwards in a curve, it's convex in shape. The surface of a soccer balls,
old television screens, and eyeballs are all convex in shape.

One of the most famous uses of a convex shape are the curving mirrors in a fun house. Not to be
confused with its popular partner, the concave mirror, which curves inwards. How can you tell which
is which? If you look like you're three feet tall and weigh 300 pounds, you're looking in a convex
mirror. If you look like you're twelve feet tall weigh 30 pounds, you're looking in a concave
mirror. Enjoy!
