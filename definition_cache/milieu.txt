Whatever he carried on the inside after more than 25 years in prison, Nelson Mandela reentered
society focusing on the milieu, or surrounding culture, of South Africans and not the prison milieu
he had left behind.

A milieu is both surroundings and everything that makes up the surroundings. Your milieu is your
world, or the context you come from. Sometimes a milieu shapes a person, as when a milieu of abuse
and poverty, inspires someone to improve things for others. Milieu sounds a lot like mildew without
the d, but unless you grew up in a moldy bathtub, mildew probably has little to do with your milieu,
or environment.
