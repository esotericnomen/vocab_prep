Someone who is indefatigable can go on for a very long time without becoming tired. You might not be
so happy to have an indefatigable guide on your walking trip––you'll have blisters, but she'll
see no reason not to keep going.

Indefatigable comes   from Latin indefatigabilis, formed from the prefix in- not plus defatigare to
tire out. Here the prefix de- means entirely. You can remember the root fatigare because it sounds
so much like the English fatigue.
