If you won’t take no for an answer, you’re pertinacious. The same holds true if you stubbornly
push on a door despite a sign that says “pull.” Pertinacious means unyielding or perversely
persistent.

We get pertinacious from the Latin pertinx, which combines per- thoroughly with tenx tenacious. You
can impress your friends by dropping pertinacious into conversation when referring to anyone who is
bullheaded and obstinately stuck in their ways and opinions. If a Girl Scout is a pertinacious
salesperson you might buy fifty boxes of Thin Mints when you only wanted one.
