The nether part of something is the lowest part of it, the bottom. If you’re having, ahem, trouble
in the toilet, you might want to go talk to the doc about your nether parts.

You might find the word nether in old books where the nether world could mean the world under the
earth’s surface, like in Dante’s Inferno where he travels through hell, under the earth, before
climbing up to paradise in the heavens. If you look closely you can hear the word nether in the word
we normally use now: beneath.
