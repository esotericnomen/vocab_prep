A crass comment is very stupid and shows that the speaker doesn't care about other people's
feelings. In today's day and age, you don't have to wear black to a funeral, but to show up in clown
pants is simply crass.

The source of this adjective is Latin crassus thick, dense, fat. A similar development of meaning
can be seen in English dense in the sense of stupid, slow to understand, from Latin densus thick,
dense, and in English thick, which can also be used to mean stupid.
