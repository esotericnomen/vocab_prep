A quibble is a small argument or fight. As a verb, it means to pick a mini-fight over something that
doesn't really matter. Let's not quibble over price, people will say, usually when they plan to
gouge you.

It's better to watch figure skating with the sound off, rather than listening to the announcers
quibble over a not-fully-rotated knee or the slightly diminished altitude of a jump. Sometimes a
quibble between neighbors over two feet of property can escalate into a major feud.
