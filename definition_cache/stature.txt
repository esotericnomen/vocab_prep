Stature is the another way to say height of a person, like the surprising stature of the movie star
who seems so much taller in his action movies.

Stature comes from the Latin word statura, meaning height, size of body, growth, but today, it  also
means a high level of respect gained by achievement. For example, after you win a Nobel Prize, your
new stature will bring new fans, more sales of your book, invitations to many exclusive dinner
parties, and maybe even your picture on magazine covers all over the world.
