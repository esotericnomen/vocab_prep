When you breathe in, you're inhaling all that invisible stuff around us called air — a mixture of
gases that includes oxygen.

To air something out can mean to expose it to the air in order to freshen it up, like leaving stinky
sneakers out on the porch for a while to help them smell better. But to air a grievance or a secret
is a whole other story — that means to publicize something that wasn't public knowledge before.
Perhaps you have a cousin who takes great delight in airing all the family's secrets.
