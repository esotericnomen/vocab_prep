A person or a place can be humble, but a person who brags about being humble, or not proud, may have
too much pride in being humble to actually be humble.

Sometimes fictional characters try to earn favor by saying I'm just a humble man in search of...,
when it is obvious they are the opposite. Truly humble people keep quiet about the good things they
do and about their humble, or poor and simple, backgrounds. In the Bible, Jesus is described as
humble because he was born in a stable, served the poor, and sacrificed himself without bragging
about it Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; and he gave all the credit to his dad.
