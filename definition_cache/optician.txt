The person who makes your eye glasses is an optician. They work in the back room of the glasses
shop, or at a factory, fabricating the lenses and attaching them to the frames.

While an optician can determine whether you are nearsighted or farsighted, if you have a medical eye
problem, you probably want to visit an optometrist or an ophthalmologist. Both of these are eye
doctors, but the latter has completed full medical training and has chosen eye health as a
specialty.
