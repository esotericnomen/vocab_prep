If you're standing still but the room is inexplicably spinning, you might want to let someone know
you're suffering from vertigo â€” the sensation of dizziness or whirling.

Contrary to popular belief, vertigo is not exactly the same thing as acrophobia, the fear of
heights. However, acrophobia can result in the symptoms associated with vertigo. Interestingly, when
legendary director Alfred Hitchcock created a film about a detective with an intense fear of
heights, he named the film Vertigo, not Acrophobia; perhaps he thought Vertigo was catchier.
