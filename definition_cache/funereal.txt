Funereal describes the mood in a locker room after an overtime loss in a championship game â€” sad,
serious and gloomy, as if you were at a funeral.

The word funereal comes from the Latin funus which means, not surprisingly, funeral. It is often
figuratively used to describe solemn or dismal things as well as something that is related to a
burial ceremony.  Funereal music is gloomy and often played at a slow pace. If you don't want to
seem overly serious, you might want to wear a navy blue suit to your job interview rather than
funereal black.
