The adjective tumultuous means disruptive, troubled, disorderly, or turbulent.

You might hear the adjective tumultuous in news stories about riots because it's one of the best
words to describe a group of people in turmoil or disorder, but it can mean anything in a state of
unrest. For example, you might steer your boat into a safe harbor before a heavy storm, so the
tumultuous waves won't sweep you onto the rocks.
