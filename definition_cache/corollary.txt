Corollary describes a result that is the natural consequence of something else. You could say that
your weight gain is a corollary of the recent arrival of a bakery across the street from your house.

The noun corollary describes an action's consequence, such as having to study more, a corollary to
getting a bad grade. The word is often seen with the prepositions “to” or “of, as in “a
corollary to fortune is fame.” Math enthusiasts may already be familiar with the word corollary,
which can be used more formally to describe a new proof or proposition that follows naturally from
an established one.
