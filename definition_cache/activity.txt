An activity is something you do, or just the state of doing. You might plan some indoor activities
for a rainy day, or you might just rely on watching your gerbils' activity in their cage.

Usually, when you use an article like an or the in front of activity, you are referring to a
specific event. For example, you might search for the best activity on the cruise ship to fill your
afternoon Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; shuffleboard, anyone? If you take the article away, and you refer to
activity, you are usually referring to action. If there is too much activity on the cruise ship
dance floor, you might want to avoid that zone.
