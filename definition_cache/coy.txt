Take the adjective, coy, for a person who pretends to be shy but really isn't, or someone who could
give a definite answer but won't. Coy behavior can be playful or just plain annoying.

Originally meaning quiet and shy, today someone who is coy pretends to be shy in a playful manner
Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; often as a form of flirting. If a politician is coy about something, he or she only
gives vague statements on an issue for fear of committing to a position or angering his or her
constituency. Common to both of these senses is the fact that a person uses coyness to subtly
manipulate his or her audience.
