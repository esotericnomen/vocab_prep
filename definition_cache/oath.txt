An oath is a promise. If you want to borrow your brother's car, you may have to swear a solemn oath
that you will bring it back unharmed.

An oath is a solemn promise, sometimes made in front of a witness, or a vow in a court of law that
you will tell the absolute truth. No matter what the circumstances are, swearing an oath is serious
business. That's why it's odd that an oath can also be an angry outburst of obscene words. Your
brother might mutter an oath under his breath and clench his fists angrily if you return his car to
him with a broken side mirror.
