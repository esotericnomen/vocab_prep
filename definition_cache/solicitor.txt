If you get into trouble in England, don't ask for a lawyer. Find a solicitor. England has two levels
of attorneys: for big problems, you'll need a barrister, but for your hypothetical legal troubles, a
solicitor should do nicely.

Some highly place attorneys in the U.S. are also called solicitors. The lawyer in charge of
government cases that come before the Supreme Court is the Solicitor General, and that was Elena
Kagan's job before President Barack Obama appointed her to the Supreme Court.  Solicitor isn’t
always a privileged position. The person who knocks on your door asking you to contribute to some
worthy cause is also a solicitor — someone who asks for — or solicits — donations.
