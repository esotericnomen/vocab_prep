When you compile something, like a recipe-book or a mix-tape, you put it together using things that
already exist (recipes, songs).

Poetry anthologies, greatest-hits albums, and world-record books are all compilations, because
they're made up of things that were originally published or released somewhere else. If you want to
skip out on soccer practice one day, you might compile of list of excuses.
