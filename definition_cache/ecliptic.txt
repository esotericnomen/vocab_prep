Astronomers use the noun ecliptic to describe the sun's path as it's seen from the Earth.

You're most likely to come across the word ecliptic in an astronomy class, since it's a technical
term for the apparent path of the sun through the stars over the course of a year. It's not possible
to see the ecliptic, since the rotation of the Earth complicates our perspective of the sun's
movement, but astronomers have long described and drawn it. It's called an ecliptic because eclipses
only happen when the moon crosses it.
