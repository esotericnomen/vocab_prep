Do you dream again and again that you are flying? If so, you could say that you have a recurrent
dream of flight. Recurrent means something that happens repeatedly.

The word recurrent comes from a Latin word meaning to return or come back. A recurrent dream, good
or bad, keeps coming back. You'll hear this word used often about abstract things like dreams,
thoughts, and in literature, themes. For instance, the theme of a motherless child finding its way
in the world is recurrent in pop culture and literature.
