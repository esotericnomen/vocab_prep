Demolition is the act of knocking something down or totally destroying it. It's what construction
crews do with sledgehammers and wrecking balls.

Not for the faint of heart, demolition usually involves explosives, bulldozers and lots of dust and
debris. The act of demolishing something could be seen as a good stress reliever though, if plowing
through drywall or mowing over shrubbery is your kind of thing. Or perhaps you could join a
demolition crew, hired to send the wrecking ball though buildings big and small.
