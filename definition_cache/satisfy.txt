To satisfy is to fulfill or meet a want, need, requirement, or expectation. A glass of water will
satisfy your thirst.

Since there are so many things we need and want, there are lots of ways to satisfy us. Eating a
sandwich will satisfy your hunger. Overhearing a conversation could satisfy your curiosity. Going to
school should satisfy your desire for knowledge. In college, you'll have to take certain classes to
satisfy requirements of your degree. Some people are harder to satisfy than others. If someone is
