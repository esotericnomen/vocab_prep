When things shrivel, they wrinkle up and get smaller, the way leaves begin to shrivel and turn brown
in the fall.

A lack of moisture can cause something to shrivel, and in humans it tends to be the natural process
of aging that makes people shrivel a bit. Flowers will shrivel if you forget to water them, and
grapes will eventually shrivel into raisins if you dry them out long enough. The root of shrivel is
uncertain, but it may have a Scandinavian source and be related to the Swedish word skryvla, to
wrinkle.
