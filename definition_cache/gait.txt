Some people have a very distinct gait, or manner of walking or running, which allows you to
recognize them from far away.

Walking with two legs is a pretty straightforward task, so most of us (with the exception of
runners) don√¢&euro;&trade;t think about our own gait very often. However, when four legs are
involved, the definition of gait becomes more complex. In horseback riding, gait is used to refer to
the particular sequence or pattern of footsteps that the horse is using. Well-known gaits include
the trot, the gallop, and the canter.
