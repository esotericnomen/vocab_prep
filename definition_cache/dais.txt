A speaker stands on a dais, or a platform, when giving a presentation. If you were speaking at the
Coffee Lovers of America's conference, you'd step onto the dais so the audience could see you over
their enormous cups o' joe.

Dais comes to us from the Old French word deis, which was originally pronounced with only one
syllable Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; more like days than the current day-us. If you take a course in a lecture
hall, your professor will need to stand on the dais so everyone can see her better.
