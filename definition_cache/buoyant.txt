Something that is buoyant floats in water. Since floating is happier than sinking, buoyant also
refers to things are fun and upbeat.

Someone with a buoyant personality is fun to be around, laughs a lot, smiles, and cheers other
people up. Buoyant people are lively and lighthearted â&euro;&rdquo; the opposite of sad,
depressed, and bummed out. Buoyant people are also called bubbly and cheerful, and it should help to
remember that buoyant objects float â&euro;&rdquo; just like a buoyant person can seem like they're
floating too (as in the expression floating on air).
