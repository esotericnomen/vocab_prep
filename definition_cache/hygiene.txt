Hygiene is any practice or activity that you do to keep things healthy and clean. Washing hands,
coughing into your elbow, and regular house cleaning are all part of good hygiene.

Hygieia was the Greek goddess of health, cleanliness and sanitation, so it's not hard to see where
the word hygiene comes from. Good oral hygiene includes brushing and flossing your teeth, and
working in a clean kitchen helps promote food hygiene. You have a better chance of staying healthy
during flu season -and any other time- if you practice good personal hygiene, such as washing your
hands frequently.
