An impediment is anything that slows or blocks progress. It can refer to a physical thing, like a
fallen tree in the road, or something more intangible, like how piracy is an impediment to the
pleasure cruise industry in Somalia.

See the pedi in there? Pedi means feet and hundreds of years ago, the word impediment referred to
shackling one's feet.  Now its use has broadened considerably. Impediment is something that blocks
or impedes your path. There's no end to the things in your life that can be considered impediments:
your small bank account, your terrible childhood, your country's economic malaise -- any one of
these could be considered an impediment in your quest for happiness.
