A chauvinist is someone who blindly and enthusiastically believes in the superiority of his cause or
people.  If you grew up in New York and refuse to eat at any pizzeria beyond a five-mile radius of
the Empire State Building, you could be described as a New York pizza chauvinist.

The word chauvinist comes from Nicholas Chauvin, a French soldier — probably fictional — who was
so devoted to Napoleon that he continued to zealously support the emperor even after Napoleon
rejected him. The put-down “male chauvinist pig” describes a man who believes that women are not
as intelligent or worthy of respect as men. Often when we hear the word chauvinist, we think of
arrogant men.
