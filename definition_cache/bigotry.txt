If a person is intolerant of other ideas, races, or religions, we call that person a bigot. The
intolerance expressed by that bigot is called bigotry. Bigotry is ugly.

There are different types of bigotry Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; like religious bigotry or racist bigotry.
Although bigotry can mean any form of intolerance or prejudice, when the word is used alone, it is
most often understood to mean racial bigotry. The bigotry behind Jim Crow laws that separated races
in the 1950s seems unbelievable to most modern teenagers.
