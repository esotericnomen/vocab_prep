Lechery is a noun applied to a person's feelings that are lustful or sexual in an extreme or
unnatural way. A person's lechery may lead to wrong and unlawful physical acts or attacks on others,
or to the making and viewing of inappropriate pictures and movies.

Someone described as a pervert might also be called a lecher, whose offensive behavior and actions
are lechery. Attraction between a husband and wife would not be lechery, because it's between two
people who have a desire together. Lechery is a one-sided lust that crosses the line to being
inappropriate and making others feel very uncomfortable or even afraid. Bad guys or Casanovas in
literature demonstrate lechery when they try to win over innocent young women with lies.
