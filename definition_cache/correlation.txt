Correlation is something that scientists are often trying to show––is there a correlation
between smoking and poor health or between napping and productivity? How about daily flossing and
good grades?

Correlation derives from the Latin cor- 'together' and -relatio 'relation'––the word is all
about things that go together. But beware: just because a study shows a correlation between two
variables, it doesn't mean one necessarily causes the other. There is a significant correlation
between going to high school and being a teenager, but that doesn't mean that going to high school
causes you to be a teenager.
