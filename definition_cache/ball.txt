Always round, often bouncy, a ball is a vital part of many games and sports, from soccer to four
square to ping pong.

The most common ball is the kind you hit, kick, bat, or duck and avoid on a playground, court, or
field. In fact, most sports involve a ball in one way or another. Another fun kind of ball is a
grand party that usually includes dancing, food, live music, and guests dressed up in glamorous
clothing. These two meanings have different origins Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; the fancy dance kind of ball
comes from a Greek root, ballizein, to dance or jump about.
