A blunt object is rounded — it isn't very pointy. A blunt comment is candid — it isn't very
subtle. When we blunt things we make them less lively, sharp, or intense.

Blunt and blunder (make a stupid mistake) may have the same origins — the Old Norse blundra,
meaning to shut one's eyes. So don't be blunt (dull or obtuse) — here are a few things you
probably don't want to do: 1) use a blunt (dull) knife to cut your tomatoes; 2) make a blunt
(outspoken) comment that might hurt someone's feelings; or 3) blunt (deaden) the sound of your
favorite music by sticking cotton balls in your ears.
