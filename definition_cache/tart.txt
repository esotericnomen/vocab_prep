A tart is small pie filled with fruit or custard, with no top crust, like the cherry tarts you
bought at the bakery.

As an adjective, tart describes a sour taste, like lemon, or harsh words, like your friend's tart
reply to a question that makes her mad. In the 19th century, tart was British slang for pretty
woman. Some believe it is a shortening of sweetheart. But by the end of that century, tart described
a prostitute, something many language scholars trace back to the tart that you get at the bakery.
