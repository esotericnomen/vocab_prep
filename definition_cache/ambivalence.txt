Someone who shows ambivalence about a person or thing has conflicting feelings. If you love your mom
but find her totally embarrassing you might feel ambivalent about having her give a presentation at
your school.

Originally a psychological term, ambivalence was borrowed from the German word Ambivalenz, coined in
1910 by the Swiss psychologist Eugen Bleuler. The German word was formed from the Latin prefix ambi-
in two ways plus Latin valentia vigor, strength.
