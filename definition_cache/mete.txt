If you mete out something (the word is usually followed by out), it means you dish it out in very
careful measured amounts. Anyone who metes out their love probably isn't someone you want to have a
relationship with.

Another word often used interchangeably with mete is dole, though there are slight differences in
meaning: dole suggests a more lavish, unthinking form of activity than the more stingy and
controlled mete, and while some nice things (like compassion or love) can be doled out, it's very
rare that anything pleasant or happy is meted out.
