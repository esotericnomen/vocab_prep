A dribble is a slow, steady flow of water. Or, if you are a basketball player, you dribble the ball
to make your way towards the basket.

Dribbling consists of tiny drops of water (or another liquid) dripping. If you've ever had a leaky
faucet going drip-drip-drip-drip, then you know exactly what dribbling is like, and how annoying it
can be. Dribbling in basketball isn't annoying at all; in fact, it's an essential skill. If you
think about it, the repeated tap-tap-tap of the ball sounds a bit like the drip-drip-drip of the
water dribbling.
