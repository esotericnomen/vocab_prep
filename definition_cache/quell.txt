Meaning to suppress or overcome, quell is what you have to do with nerves before a big test and
fears before going skydiving.

When it first came into existence, the verb quell actually meant â&euro;&oelig;to murder.â&euro;?
That's a big more serious than our modern definition, but you can use that old definition to help
you imagine offing your worries or putting a permanent end to criticism. These days quell is often
used to mean pacify, as in the police quelling an angry mob or a mom quelling a kid's temper
tantrum.
