When things are messy, wacky, crazy, and all over the place, they are pell-mell â€” chaotic.

If your room is a mess, with clothes everywhere, it's pell-mell. If people are running in every
direction and yelling, that's a pell-mell situation. Whenever things are out of hand, off the hook,
and chaotic, it's pell-mell. Words with a similar structure and meaning are higgledy-piggledy,
harum-scarum, and helter-skelter.
