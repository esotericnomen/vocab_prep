A pall was originally a coffin’s cloak. Now pall usually means that an event or situation is —
literally or figuratively — covered in gloom, like disappointing news that casts a pall on your
day.

The noun pall comes from the Latin word, pallium, “covering or cloak.”  This use of pall has
come to mean gloom like your grandparents' not being there to celebrate with you that casts a pall
over your graduation. The verb pall is used when someone or something becomes boring or less
interesting over time, like your initial willingness to perform household that began to pall when
you realize no one else wants to pitch in to keep things neat.
