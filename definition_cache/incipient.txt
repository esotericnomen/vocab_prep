Incipient means something is in an early stage of existence. In its incipient form, basketball was
played with a soccer ball and peach baskets for goals. Bouncy orange balls and nets came later.

Incipient comes from the Latin incipere to begin. The related, and more commonly used, word
inception means the beginning or the start. It is important to note that when something is in an
incipient stage, there is a chance it will never come to completion. So be on the lookout for
incipient trouble or an incipient crisis Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; you might be able to prevent it from
happening.
