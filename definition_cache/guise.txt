Guise, a noun, is the art of pretending to be something you aren't, like when, in the guise of an
invited guest, you fake your way into the party of the century.

No doubt youâ&euro;&trade;ve noticed the similarity between guise and disguise. Both involve the
art of deception: itâ&euro;&trade;s the methods that differ. Guise is about trying on new attitudes
and mannerisms, such as speaking and acting in the guise of a native in a place where you are
actually a tourist. Disguise involves hiding your real identity, disappearing in the new role.
