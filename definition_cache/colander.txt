Most cooks would agree that a colander is an essential piece of equipment for even the most basic
kitchen. It's a bowl, usually made of plastic or metal, with holes in it to allow liquid to drain
away from the food.

Colanders are used for draining anything Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; for instance, if you're washing fruit, a
colander would make the job quick and easy. If you're cooking pasta, you toss the pasta into a pot
of boiling water, then when it's cooked, you pour the contents of the pot through a colander, and
what's left behind in the colander, drained and ready to eat, is the pasta.
