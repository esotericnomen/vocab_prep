Braggadocio means not only bragging, but bragging about something that’s not true. When your
friend boasts of a private yacht, ten personal servants and nightly caviar dinners, that’s
braggadocio, unless he happens to live on the French Riviera.

Braggadocio comes from the word brag, but saves you the trouble of calling someone's bragging a lie
by giving you one word that does both. You might say that the new guy at work who keeps telling
stories about his heroic genius for fixing any computer is full of braggadocio––since when you
asked him for help with yours he had no idea what to do.
