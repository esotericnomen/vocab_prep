A constitution is a statement of the basic principles and laws of a nation, state, or group, such as
the U.S. Constitution. Another very common meaning of constitution is the physical makeup of a
person.

The noun constitution is from Latin, from constitutus set up, established plus the suffix -ion- act,
state, or condition. So think of a constitution as how a body (yours, the government's) is set up.
If you have a strong constitution, it means you don't get sick very often.
