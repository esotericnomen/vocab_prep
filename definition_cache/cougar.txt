A cougar is a type of large cat — male cougars can reach eight feet long. You may have seen a
cougar in a nature program about the animals of North and South America.

A cougar is a feline, but these cats are not tame house pets — they are dangerous wild animals.
Found from Canada all the way to the South America, cougars are also called pumas, mountain lions,
panthers, and catamounts. The word cougar is also a slang term for an older woman who dates much
younger men. Even when it is meant to be a compliment, like any stereotype, cougar has the potential
to offend — best to avoid.
