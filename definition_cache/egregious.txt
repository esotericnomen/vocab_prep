Something that is egregious stands out, but not in a good way â€” it means really bad or offensive,
like a tattoo on a man misspelling his girlfriend's name.

My massage therapist gave me bruises, someone complained recently on Twitter, asking, When does it
cease to be deep tissue massage therapy and become egregious and unabashed manhandling? An egregious
error is hardly forgivable. Some synonyms are shocking, appalling, and intolerable. The word has
made a 180-degree turn from its original sense in Latin, when it meant exceptionally good. Word
historians have speculated that the negative usage was originally meant to be ironic, but it is the
only sense that has survived. Be careful not to use it to mean outstanding, since no one wants to be
called egregious.
