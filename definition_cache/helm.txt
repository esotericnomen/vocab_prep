The person at the helm is the person in charge, and if you happen to be at sea, that person is the
one steering the boat with a device called a helm, the mechanism that keeps the boat on course.

When someone takes over from someone else â&euro;&rdquo; as when a newly elected official takes
office, or when a company appoints a new head â&euro;&rdquo; you would say that new person has
taken the helm. But if you're going to take the helm or be at the helm, you can't have an empty
boat. There's got to be a group in there with you that you're taking the helm for, guiding them all.
