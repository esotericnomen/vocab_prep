If a waiter brought a big, deep serving dish to your table, removed its lid, and began ladling soup
into your bowl, you could confidently call the dish a tureen.

A tureen can be made out of earthenware or porcelain or even silver; the most famous tureen
â&euro;&rdquo; or at least the most expensive â&euro;&rdquo; may have been an 18th century French
model that was auctioned off in 1996 for more than ten million dollars.
