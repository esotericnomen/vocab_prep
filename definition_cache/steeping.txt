Steep means sharply angled. When hiking trails lead straight up mountainsides, they've got a steep
incline. Steep also means to soak in, as in steeping a tea bag in boiling water.

You often hear steep used as an adjective to describe cliffs, hills, or even water park slides that
have a perilous slope. Steep can apply to curves on a chartâ&euro;&ldquo;â&euro;&ldquo;you might
say when someone who has a lot to learn that their learning curve is going to be steep. Steep also
comes up to describe exorbitant changes in costs or spending. Everyone would love to travel more,
but sometimes plane fare is too steep.
