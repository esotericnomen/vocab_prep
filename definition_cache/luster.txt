Something with luster has a certain kind of sheen or shininess, like the way a new pair of shoes

Luster is a noun that commonly refers to a soft sheen, glossy surface, or brightness. It comes from
the Italian word lustro, which means to make bright. Daniel Defoe, author of the novel Robinson

must be polished, or the luster of it will never appear.â&euro;?
