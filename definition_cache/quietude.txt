Your mother has probably more than once asked you for quietude even if she hasn't used the word.
Quietude means a state of peace and quiet. It goes hand in hand with solitude.

Quietude is a word that is used less and less, as we seem to have less time and space for it. A park
used to be a good place to find quietude, but with cell phones, you're likely to begin chatting even
when no one else is around. If you really want quietude, you might try a library, or a chapel.
Meditation can be used to bring you a moment of quietude wherever you are. Try it now. Ohhhmmm.
Ohhhmmm. Ohhhmmm.
