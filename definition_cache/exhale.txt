When you breathe, you inhale and exhale. In other words, you breathe in and out. When you breathe
out, you exhale.

If you exhale on a cold winter day, your breath looks like smoke in the frigid air. Yoga classes,
with their emphasis on breathing, involve a lot of inhaling and exhaling. When you exhale, your
lungs push air out, reducing the carbon dioxide in your body and making room for you to inhale
oxygen. The Latin root exhalare combines ex, out, and halare, breathe.
