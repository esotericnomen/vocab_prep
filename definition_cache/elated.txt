If you're elated you aren't just happy — you're over the moon, absolutely excited and bursting
with pride. Like the way you feel after winning a scholarship to an Ivy league school or mastering a
back handspring.

You might be elated to hear you got that dream job. That is, until you find out it doesn't come with
any vacation days or health benefits. But don't let that dampen your elation. Feeling Elated is all
about being so extremely proud and overjoyed, and usually happens as a result of an accomplishment.
So if you've just achieved something big, feel free to be elated — and enjoy your time on cloud 9.
