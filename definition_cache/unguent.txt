That sometimes sticky or greasy salve you put on cuts or rashes is also called an unguent. Whether
it's a cream or a gel, the main purpose of an unguent is to heal or protect a sore.

Unguent comes from the Latin unguentum, ointment. Ancient unguents were luxurious and included
fragrant oils used to anoint and perfume the skin. Some were even symbolically incorporated into
religious ceremonies. In old-time of medicine shows, potions and unguents were sold as having
magical properties but were usually concocted from common ingredients that could sometimes even be
dangerous.
