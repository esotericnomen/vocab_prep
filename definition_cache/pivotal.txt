High school graduation is a pivotal moment in most people's lives â€” an important point that
signifies a shift in direction.

You see the word pivot in pivotal. That is because when something is pivotal, it is central, and
everything related to the topic turns or depends on it. An election can be a pivotal moment in a
nation's history if the direction the country takes depends on it. Your belief in reincarnation may
be pivotal to how you treat animals. Pivotal means important, but it has the sense of centrality and
turning.
