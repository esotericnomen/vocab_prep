If you measure the distance of an object from side to side, you are measuring the object’s
breadth: “Theodore measured the breadth of the table before buying it to make sure it would fit in
his small kitchen.”

Breadth often refers to a physical measurement, but it can also be used to describe
comprehensiveness or largeness of any kind, such as breadth of knowledge or breadth of experience.
In the famous sentence describing Macedonian king Alexander the Great, the word breadth is used to
indicate the vastness of Alexander’s empire: “When Alexander saw the breadth of his domain he
wept, for there were no more worlds to conquer.”
