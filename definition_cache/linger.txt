When someone lingers, he or she takes an unexpectedly long time to depart, as Romeo lingers when
bidding Juliet farewell (or as annoying houseguests almost always tend to do).

In addition to its primary meaning of taking a long time to depart, linger has the additional
meaning of persisting while gradually weakening. In this sense, linger can refer to feelings or
sensations that slowly fade away, like the smell of perfume that lingers in an elevator after the
passengers have exited.
