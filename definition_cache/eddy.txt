An eddy is a whirlpool — what you stare at as a kid when the water is draining out of the bathtub.

Pronounced exactly like the name, “Eddie,” this word means to swirl in a direction opposite of
the current. Any substance like water, fog, smoke, or air can create an eddy, but it is most
commonly seen as a term related to water. Books from the flapper era of the 1920s often include a
description of a nightclub with an eddy of cigarette smoke above a woman’s head.
