The adjective obtuse is good for describing someone slow on the uptake: Don't be so obtuse: get with
the program!

The adjective obtuse literally means rounded or blunt, but when it's used for a person, it means not
quick or alert in perception Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; in other words, not the sharpest tool in the shed. It's
not just for dull people, but also dull angles: in geometry, an obtuse angle is one that is not so
sharp (between 90 and 180 degrees).
