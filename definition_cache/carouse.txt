Carouse means to drink a lot of alcohol and behave in a loud, exuberant way. The neighbors will not
appreciate it if you and your friends carouse in the backyard until dawn.

Carouse comes from the German  gar aus trinken meaning “all out, “drain the cup” or “drink
up.” The English adopted the word in the 16th century, and it came to mean “sitting around
drinking until closing time.” A noisy drinking party is sometimes called a carouse.
