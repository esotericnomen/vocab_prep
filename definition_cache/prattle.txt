If your little sister won't stop talking about her latest crush and you don't want to hear it, you
might say, Stop prattling on about that loser! To prattle is go on and on about something
unimportant.

Prattle can also be a noun. If your sister tattles about your comment regarding her prattling, you
could defend yourself to your mother with: I didn't mean to call Sophie's crush a loser, but she had
driven me mad with her constant prattle. There are a lot of funny-sounding words with a meaning
similar to prattle - chatter, blether, blather, jabber, gabble, blabber, and babble, to name a few.
