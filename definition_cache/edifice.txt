Edifice means a building, but it doesn't mean just any building. To merit being called an edifice, a
building must be important. A mini temple can be an edifice, or a towering sky scraper.

The meaning of edifice has expanded to include a system of ideasâ&euro;&ldquo;â&euro;&ldquo;when
it is complicated enough to be considered to have walls and a roof, then it is an edifice. You could
say that basic facts of addition and subtraction are the foundation on which the edifice of higher
math rests.
