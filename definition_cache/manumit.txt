To manumit means to set free, like in the United States in the late 1800s, after centuries of
slavery, African-American men and women were manumitted by the plantation owners: they were set
free, able to live however they chose.

Manumit comes from a Latin word that literally means “set forth from the hand,” which is exactly
how slavery ends, by handing someone’s life back to them.  The history of slavery is full of
sadness, but when people are manumitted, the process of healing can begin as a result of the new
freedom.  While slavery is a sensitive topic, it’s especially difficult to talk about if you
can’t pronounce manumit the right way, so try it like this: man-yuh-MITT.
