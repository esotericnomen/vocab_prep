Rendezvous is a very French way to say meeting or date. So go ahead and call your next dentist
appointment or lunch date with friends a rendezvous.

In the 1590s, rendezvous meant â&euro;&oelig;a place for assembling of troops.â&euro;? And you'll
still hear military tacticians talking about rendezvous points today. But more often we use
rendezvous to describe an assembling of friends, an appointment, or a date with your secret lover.
If you're feeling extra Frenchy, you can use rendezvous as a verb, as in Let's rendezvous next
Saturday at the mall.
