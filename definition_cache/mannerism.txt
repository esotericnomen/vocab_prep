Does someone you know always shrug in a particular way or say You know what I mean? at the end of
every sentence? Well, that's a mannerism, a habitual gesture or way of speaking.

Generally, we don't use then term mannerism as a critical term for our friends' behavior, but when
applied as a term of art criticism, it can be a negative thing. If a critic talks about a writer's
mannerisms, for example, it's probably intended as an insult â&euro;&rdquo; suggesting they're
writing in a lazy or clichĂŠd way. However, Mannerism, with a capital M, refers to a specific
16th-century Italian style of painting known for its artificial (as opposed to naturalistic)
effects.
