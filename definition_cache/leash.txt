Dog owners who live in the city need a leash, a rope or cord attached to the dog's collar that helps
his owner keep him safe and restrained.

When you walk a dog, you hold his leash to guide him along the sidewalk and keep him from chasing
squirrels into busy streets. The word leash is also useful for describing a figurative kind of guide
or restraint: The teachers at that school keep their students on a short leash when they take field
trips downtown. The students aren't on actual leashes, but they are constrained. Leash comes from
the Old French word laissier, or loose.
