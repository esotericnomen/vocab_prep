A paramour is a lover, and often a secret one you're not married to. So it's best not to kiss and
make eyes at your paramour in public, unless you want to be the center of a lot of gossip.

The noun paramour evolved from the French phrase par amour, meaning “passionately” or “with
desire.” If you break it down, you get par, meaning by, and amour, the French word for love. Once
upon a time, women used this word to describe Christ, and men would use it to refer to the Virgin
Mary. But eventually, paramour shed its religious connotations and came to mean “darling” or
“sweetheart,” and later “mistress” or “clandestine lover.”
