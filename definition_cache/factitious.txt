If you create a diamond out of plastic, then you’ve created a factitious diamond, meaning that
it’s a phony.

Factitious, pronounced fac-TISH-us, means fake, like a factitious compliment you give the person who
cooked you an awful meal — you don't mean it, but you say it anyway, just to be nice. As he or she
happily walks away, another friend might whisper, Were you being facetious about the dinner being
good? Facetious, pronounced fuh-SEE-shuhs, means trying to be funny. Don't confuse factitious with
facetious — or fictitious, which means made up.
