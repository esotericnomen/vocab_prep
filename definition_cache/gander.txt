A gander is a male goose, and also an insult meaning simpleton, a bit like calling someone a silly
goose.

Besides being the proper name for a male goose and a slang word for silly man, the word gander also
shows up in the idiom take a gander. The slang sense of gander comes from the meaning recorded in
1886, to take a long look by craning one's neck like a goose, or wander foolishly (again, like a
goose).
