To bear is to carry or endure, whether by physical or mental force. If you can bear to read on,
you'll find out all the different ways to use the word bear.

Obviously you know the big hairy mountain-roaming animal, but you might not have heard about a bear
on Wall Street — an investor who is pessimistic about the market. In its verb form, bear is rooted
in the Old English beran, meaning “to bring forth, sustain, endure” and more. So you can bear
(or carry) a grudge. You can bear (or give birth to) children. Or you can bear (or stand) to listen
to your great aunt tell the same story for the umpteenth time if you have a kind soul.
