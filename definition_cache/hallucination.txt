If you see your teacher morph into a dancing elephant, chances are you’re having a hallucination,
or an illusory perception. In other words, it sounds like you are seeing things!

A person experiencing a hallucination perceives things that aren’t really there. A hallucination
can involve any of the senses — including sight, hearing, touch, smell, and taste — and often
results from a mental disorder or a chemical source, such as a drug.
