Platonic describes a relationship that is purely spiritual and not physical. If a guy and a girl
hang out all the time but aren't boyfriend and girlfriend, they'd describe their friendship as
platonic.

This word platonic refers to the writings of Plato, an ancient Greek philosopher who wrote on the
interesting subject of love. Platonic love and platonic friendships are marked by the absence of
physical or sexual desire. Plato did acknowledge physical desire, but thought that if two people
truly inspired each other, their spiritual or ideal love would bring them closer to God.
