Mores are the customs, norms, and behaviors that are acceptable to a society or social group. If
your personal morals are in disagreement with local mores, you should be prepared to be annoyed
every time you read the local Letters to the Editor.

Mores and morals have similar meaningsâ&euro;&ldquo;â&euro;&ldquo;mores are the morals of a group
or society itself. They are not necessarily based on written law and they can change. The mores of
the Victorian era proscribed modesty for women. A Victorian time traveling to our time would
probably be shocked by current mores that allow women to wear shorts.
