An elevation is a rise or the raising of something. Mountains have an elevation based on how high
they are and your mood has an elevation as you get happier.

Elevation is a noun that tells how high something is raised above a surface or ground line. It's
also a term for measuring things like temperatures or degrees. Your body temperature might have an
elevation if you have the flu, just as the elevation of a hill increases as it gets steeper.
Buildings have an elevation too: The front of a building from top to bottom is its front elevation
of the structure.
