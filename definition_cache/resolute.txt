Use the adjective resolute to describe a purposeful and determined person, someone who wants to do
something very much, and won't let anything get in the way.

Milo thought for just a moment and then, with a resolute 'I shall,' volunteered to go, Norton Juster
writes in the classic children's novel The Phantom Tollbooth. From the way Milo said I shall, we can
infer that he was quite confident in his split-second decision, or at least made himself appear to
be so. Some  near-synonyms for this word include resolved, adamant, unswerving, and unwavering. If
you make a resolute refusal of something, you're declaring you don't like it and never will.
