To swelter is to be hot — very, very hot, like on a humid, ninety-degree day. To swelter is to
feel like you're in an oven.

This word is most often seen in the form sweltering, as in The weather is sweltering! It's been over
95 degrees for a week straight. Any form of swelter is going to involve major heat — enough heat
to make you sweat buckets. The opposite of swelter is freeze.
