play poker occasionally just to remind yourself that you always lose.

The adverb occasionally is good for things that happen every now and then. You get tired of the cold
occasionally, but the snow is lovely.  Occasionally, you think of your long lost love, but never
write.  The idea comes to you occasionally that you should move somewhere with more people and
warmer weather.  I worry about you occasionally.
