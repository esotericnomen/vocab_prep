The word pulse has many shades of meaning, but most of them involve something characterized by
short, rhythmic bursts. If you’re angry, the muscles in your jaw might pulse — meaning they
contract quickly in short bursts.

Pulse can be a noun that describes the rhythmic pumping of blood through your veins and arteries.
You’ve probably had a nurse take your pulse as a way to measure your heart rate. Pulse can refer
to other things that have a rhythmic beat, like the pulse of dance music or a pulse of flashing
light. The verb describes something that throbs, literally or figuratively. Your blood will pulse
through your veins, or a busy city may pulse with life.
