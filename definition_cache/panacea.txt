If someone offers you a pill that promises eternal life, don’t take the pill.  It’s a panacea, a
remedy that falsely claims to solve every problem ever.

The Greek word pan means “all” (think of a panorama, a view where you can see everywhere).  The
Greek word for “cure” is akēs (which looks like the word “aches”).  Those are the roots of
panacea, a cure for all aches.  But a panacea doesn’t really cure everything; it just acts like it
can.  Use the word to describe an unbelievable solution, like a new law that will make everyone
rich, or a robot that does your homework for you.
