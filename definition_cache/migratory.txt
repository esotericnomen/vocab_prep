Animals that change locations with the seasons are said to be migratory. Ruby-throated hummingbirds
are migratory. They spend winter in the warmer climate of Mexico, Central, and South America and
then return to the eastern United States in the spring.

People who move from place to place in search of work are said to be migratory. The adjective is
often used in combination with the noun workers. In the United States, migratory workers travel from
state to state to help bring in the harvest, often with whole families traveling together. After a
cold winter, you might want to be a bit migratory yourself: you could move south to Florida in the
winter and return north to Ottawa each spring.
