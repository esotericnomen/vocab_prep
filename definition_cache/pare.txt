To pare is to trim â€” like when you pare branches on a tree or pare down your expenses to save
money.

Pare comes from the Latin word parare, meaning to prepare.  Think of peeling potatoes, which you
might do with a paring knife, or paring your nails so you'll make a neat appearance. In each case,
you are trimming something gradually. If you pare down your expectations, you might be pleasantly
surprised.
