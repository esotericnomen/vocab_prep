If you are ever served with a writ, then you better do what it says. A writ is a written document
issuing a legal order.

The word writ has been around since before the twelfth century and was first used to describe a
written document needed to have a case heard at the royal courts of England during the Middle Ages.
Nowadays, the king is most likely no longer involved, but this word still refers to a legal document
issued by a court of law. A writ contains a written order instructing someone to do something or to
stop doing something. If you ever need to give out a writ, remember that the verb to serve is
typically used to describe the issuing of a writ — as in “Tony was served with a writ on
Monday.”
