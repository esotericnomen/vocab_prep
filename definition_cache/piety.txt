Piety is devotion to God or to religious practices. Nuns who pray all day long are famous for their
piety. If you have filial piety it means you're devoted to your parents.

Piety is sometimes used in a disapproving way to mean that the person is only pretending to be
devoted or good.  Piety was borrowed from French pietĂŠ piety, pity, from Latin pietas, from pius
devoted, kind. This Latin adjective is the source of our English adjective pious.
