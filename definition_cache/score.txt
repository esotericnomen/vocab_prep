A set of twenty things is a score. Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address began Four score and seven
years ago. Four score means 4 times 20, so Lincoln could have just said 87 years ago, but it didn't
have the same ring to it!

In a game, the score tells you the number of points each team has. In school, you can score or earn
a number of points for every test or paper you turn in. That grade (or an accumulation of grades) is
your class score. Score can also be used to describe the facts about an event or the components of a
musical composition. So, when you ask, What's the score? you could be met with a variety of answers
depending on the context!
