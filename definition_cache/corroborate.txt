To corroborate is to back someone else’s story. If you swear to your teacher that you didn't throw
the spitball, and your friends corroborate your story by promising that you were concentrating on
math homework, she might actually believe you.

For example, a witness in court corroborates the testimony of others, and further experimentation
can corroborate a scientific theory. Near synonyms are substantiate and confirm. Corroborate,
originally meaning to support or strengthen, was borrowed from Latin corrōborāre, formed from the
prefix cor- completely plus rōborāre to strengthen (from rōbur strength).
