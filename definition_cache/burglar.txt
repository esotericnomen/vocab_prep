Use the word burglar when you're talking about someone who steals things from inside a house or a
building.

A burglar often breaks a window or forces a lock, intending to take valuable items. The act of doing
this is burglary, and to do it is to burglarize in the United States, or to burgle in Britain. In
the 1540's, burglar was a short form of the word burglator, from the Latin burgare, to break open.
