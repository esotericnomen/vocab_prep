The hardest part about piano lessons is having to give a recital, or to demonstrate what you've
learned in front of an audience.

You can also use the noun recital to describe the telling of a story. Your uncle might be famous for
boring people at parties with his recital of youthful Boy Scout adventures, for example. In the
1500s, recital was strictly a legal term, the statement of relevant facts, but the musical meaning
had come into use by the 1800s. The root is the Latin word recitare, repeat from memory.
