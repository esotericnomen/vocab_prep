Can't get your point across? Maybe you just need to speak more clearly or articulate your thoughts
better â€” in short, enunciate.

Good enunciation is similar to pronunciation, but describes more specifically how clearly someone
expresses themselves. The word enunciate is related to the Latin words for both announce and
messenger. So most likely those ancient Romans who created the word wanted a messenger who could
announce things without mumbling, grumbling, and rambling.
