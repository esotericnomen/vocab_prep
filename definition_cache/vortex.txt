Think vortex and picture a tornado or whirlpool â€” swirling around, causing destruction.

If you picture a whirlpool spinning and draining like water out of a bathtub, you'll get a pretty
good impression of what a vortex looks like. Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz found out first-hand the
meaning of vortex as she and her house whirled around in the funnel cloud of a tornado. In a
figurative sense, vortex can be used to tell about something that seems like it is  whirling out of
control, all consuming, or chaotic. This may include exam week, your relationships, or your life in
general.
