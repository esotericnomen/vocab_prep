Obstreperous means boisterous, noisy, aggressive, defiant. You’ve probably seen an obstreperous
child in the grocery store, pulling away from her mother, screaming at the top of her lungs.

If you’ve been to a large concert where the band doesn't come on stage for hours, you might have
been part of an obstreperous crowd: increasingly impatient, with fights breaking out, things thrown
up onto the stage, and demands being shouted, Give us some music before the night is out! Some
people are kind and gentle with strangers, but around their own family turn obstreperous, shouting
You never loved me! at their mom when she gives them the smaller of two cookies.
