A bout is a fight. If you want to be boxer, start with some easy bouts before challenging the champ.

A bout is a period of time in which something intense happens, like fighting, binging, or being
sick, and comes from the word for bending, or going round in a circle. We usually use it these days
for something you wouldn't want to go on for too long of a time. If the full moon makes you crazy,
you might suffer a bout of madness.
