A definitive answer is a final one. A definitive decision by a court of law is one that will not be
changed. A definitive translation is one everyone turns to as correct. Definitive means
authoritative, conclusive, final.

Be careful not to confuse definitive with definite. Definite means clearly defined. You can have a
definite opinion that JFK could not have been assassinated by a lone gunman, but the definitive
interpretation remains that of the Warren Commission Report, which held there was only one.
