Old, cranky, and more than a little stubborn, a curmudgeon is the crusty grey haired neighbor who
refuses to hand out candy at Halloween and shoos away holiday carolers with a bah humbug!

As fickle and stubborn as the type of person it describes, curmudgeon comes to us without a history,
its origins undisclosed. It was originally believed to have come from coeur mechant, the French
phrase for “evil heart,” but that theory has been long discarded. Don't worry though, you’ll
know a curmudgeon when you see one: He’ll be ill-tempered and miserly, eager to shake his fist and
spout disagreeable opinions.
