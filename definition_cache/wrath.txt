Wrath is great anger that expresses itself in a desire to punish someone: Noah saw the flood as a
sign of the wrath of God.

Wrath is also used figuratively of things that behave in a violent way: Earthquakes are the wrath of
the sea. This noun and the corresponding adjective wrathful are in literary use but are formal or
old-fashioned words, that crop up in fantasy fiction or movies set in prehistoric times.
