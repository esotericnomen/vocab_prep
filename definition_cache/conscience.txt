A conscience is a built-in sense of what's right and what's wrong. That sick feeling in your stomach
after you meanly told your younger brother the truth about Santa Claus? That might be your
conscience bothering you.

The word conscience contains the word science, which comes from the Latin word scientia, meaning to
know or knowledge. You can think of your conscience as your knowledge of yourself, especially when
it comes to your own morals, or your feelings about right and wrong. Pangs of conscience, which feel
like an uncomfortable inner voice, are helpful when you're trying to decide the right thing to do in
a particular situation.
