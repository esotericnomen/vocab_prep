If you're relaxing on the beach, dreaming of how you will never have to get up and go back to work,
you're engaged in a reverie, or pleasant daydream.

There's nothing wrong with reverie, but if you follow its path into English, you'll see how closely
it is connected to madness. The noun is from French rĂŞverie, from a Middle French word meaning
wild speech, delirium, from rever to roam, speak wildly. Middle French rever is also the source of
English rave, as in raving mad.
