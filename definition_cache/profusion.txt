If there's an abundance of something, you can say that there's a profusion of it. Hilarious and
bizarre YouTube videos certainly exist in profusion.

The noun profusion comes from a Latin word profusionem, meaning a pouring out. So you can think of
profusion as an outpouring of something Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; an overflow or cornucopia of it. An area
known for wine making should have a profusion of grapes growing along the hillsides. And an awesome
performance should garner a profusion of compliments and shouts of encore!
