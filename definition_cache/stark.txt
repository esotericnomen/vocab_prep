Stark means complete or extreme, like the stark contrast between your music taste — punk and weird
metal — and your mom's, with all her 1950's doo-wop favorites.

In describing a place, stark means providing no shelter or sustenance. A barren desert or a room
with no furniture or curtains is stark. It can also mean severe, stern, or austere, like the stark
beauty of the rocky cliffs in the west of Ireland. Stark can also be used to mean totally. If you
are called stark, raving mad, there's no question about it: you are acting completely crazy.
