Do you see hundreds of cattle thundering toward you? Then stop reading and get out of there! A
stampede is coming.

Stampede is a word for animal behavior that fits people sometimes too. During the holidays,
desperate parents might stampede the mall, especially the toy stores. Fans of a popular movie might
stampede to get tickets. A stampede of teen girls can usually be found chasing the latest boy bands.
Stampede can be a noun or a verb, but either way, look out!
