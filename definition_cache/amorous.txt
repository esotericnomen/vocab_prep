If you are shot with a mythological arrow by cupid, the Greek god of love, you may find yourself
making amorous advances on the next person you meet. Amorous means having strong feelings of love,
especially sexual love.

Amorous words or glances show love or sexual desire. This adjective is a Middle English word,
borrowed from Middle French, from Medieval Latin amorosus, from Latin amor love. A more literary and
less common synonym is amatory.
