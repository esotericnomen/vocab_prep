At every funeral, there comes a moment when someone who knew the dead person speaks about their
life. They are delivering what is known as a eulogy. A eulogy is a formal speech that praises a
person who has died.

Usually a eulogy makes the dead person sound a lot more impressive than they really were. A couple
of less common synonyms for this kind of praise the dead speech are panegyric and encomium.
Sometimes the dead person was so unimpressive that there's nothing nice to say. And sometimes they
were so awful that the only appropriate speech is a dyslogy that describes their faults and
failings.
