You'd be pretty soggy by morning if you accidentally set your tent up in a bog. A bog is a swampy
kind of ground made up mostly of decomposing plants and mosses.

Nothing can be built on a bog because the ground is so spongy and damp, and no crops can be grown
there. The dried soil from a bog can, however, be dried and burned for fuel. A figurative bog is
anything that you tend to get stuck in, like a bog of health problems. Things can also bog you down,
or slow you down literally or figuratively, like when your homework bogs you down so you can't enjoy
the weekend.
