If a politician pretends to be angry as a way of rousing the anger of the voters and getting more
votes, he's guilty of artifice â€” a subtle and crafty trick.

Before taking on its current meaning, artifice meant a skilled piece of workmanship.  A beautiful
diamond bracelet might have been considered a piece of artifice, for example; now it would only be
called artifice if the diamonds were fake.
