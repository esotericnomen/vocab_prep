People who are able to look back on the past and understand what happened have hindsight. If you go
skating on a frozen lake and it cracks, in hindsight you'd know you should've paid attention to the
giant danger sign.

Hindsight is like looking behind you to see what just happened (behind sight, get it?). Another way
of describing retrospection, hindsight is a useful skill that can be cultivated. Hindsight often
refers to a lesson learned from something going wrong. Billy Wilder, the American movie director,
once commented wistfully, â&euro;&oelig;Hindsight is always twenty-twenty.â&euro;? It's much
easier to see clearly after something happened than before.
