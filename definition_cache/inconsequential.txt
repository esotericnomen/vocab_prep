If something is considered of little worth or importance, it is inconsequential. If astronomers
forecast a tremendous meteor shower, it might turn out to be no more than space junk, too
inconsequential to record.

You can use the adjective inconsequential to describe things that just donâ&euro;&trade;t matter or
are of no relevance, as in the rainy forecast is totally inconsequential â&euro;&rdquo; the bowling
tournament is inside! It also describes things that don't make sense in a certain order, trying to
win their votes is inconsequential: the election's over. Something small or minor can be
inconsequential too, though the red bump on your nose on picture-day may not seem as inconsequential
to you as it does to the photographer.
