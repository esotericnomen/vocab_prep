For something that's very harmful, especially a tumor that's cancerous, use the term malignant.

Malignant and its opposite benign are medical terms used to describe a tumor or growth as either
cancerous or not respectively. The gn part of both words comes from the Latin word for born,
differing in the prefix mal evil and bene kind. A malignant tumor grows uncontrollably and spreads
to other parts of the body. Though less common, malignant can also be used to mean evil, malicious
like when someone has a malignant imagination.
