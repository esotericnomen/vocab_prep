A short list of people not to taunt: your big brother, cops, nightclub bouncers, dragons. Taunts are
insulting comments, and, unless you are a really, really fast runner, keep them to yourself.

Taunting is often associated with large groups picking on an individual. A mob might call out a
hated king from his castle with taunts and jeers. Taunting the weak is a high-school phenomenon that
teachers, administrators, parents, and students are working together to stop.
