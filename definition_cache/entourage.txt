You know that group of people — friends, assistants, bodyguards — that are always surrounding
you everywhere you go?  That's your entourage!

Entourage comes from the French word entourer, meaning “to surround,” and means the people who
surround someone.  It's also pronounced like a French word, ending with the soft  sound “razh”
(not “rage”): ON-too-razh.  The size of a pop star's entourage might grow with every hit record
she releases. You know you've really made it when your entourage won't fit in one limo.
