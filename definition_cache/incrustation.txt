Incrustation means a crust that covers something, the way a crust is baked onto a loaf of bread or
jewels encrust a crown.

Incrustation and its spelling variant encrustation refer to a crust that can grow on something
concrete or abstract. If you have lost in love, you might feel that there has been an incrustation
of your heart, such that it is sealed away where it cannot be hurt again.
