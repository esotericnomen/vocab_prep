A wretch is someone who is so miserable and unlucky that you almost have to feel sorry for the
person. You might pity the poor wretch who was fired at work over something that wasn’t even his
fault.

Wretch traces back to the Old English word wrecca, meaning “banished person” — so no wonder a
wretch is so unhappy! A wretch is in such a bad situation that a sense of pity typically goes along
with the word, and you’ll often see the terms “poor wretch” or “unfortunate wretch.”
Wretch can also be used more informally to describe someone who’s wicked or hateful, like that
ungrateful wretch who complained to the boss when you brought snacks to work.
