Centigrade is all about water.   The centigrade scale goes from zero to one hundred, where zero is
the point where water freezes, and one hundred is when water boils.

Centigrade is also called Celsius, but it’s never called Fahrenheit — because that’s a totally
different measurement of temperature.  Break centigrade down to its Latin roots: centum (meaning
“a hundred”) and gradus (meaning “steps). There are one hundred steps in the centigrade scale,
see?  There is a way to convert centigrade to Fahrenheit, but this is vocabulary not mathematics;
you’re on your own with that.
