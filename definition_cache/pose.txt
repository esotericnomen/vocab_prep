To pose is to assume a particular stance. Like a runway model strutting to the end of the catwalk,
posing with her hands on her hips, and then gracefully walking back.

The original meaning of pose from the 14th century is to put in a certain position. The sense of
pose as to assume a certain attitude emerged in the 1850Ã¢&euro;&trade;s. When a person poses, he
presents himself in a particular way, often with the hope of impressing others. But if you're just
posing objects, then the word loses the negative connotation.
