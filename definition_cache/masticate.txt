To masticate is to chew your food or to bite and grind stuff with your teeth.

While humans use their teeth, primarily molars, to masticate their food, some animals have evolved
other ways to do this. Some masticate by crushing food between hard plates on the top and bottom of
their mouths, and others masticate by using a spiny tongue to break down their food.
