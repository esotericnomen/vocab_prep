If you're just learning to skateboard, you’ve probably got an ugly bruise or two to show for it
— those purple and yellow patches you get on your skin where you’ve bumped and scraped, and they
probably hurt, too.

You can find bruises at the grocery store, too — those soft, mushy spots on a peach or an apple
— and if you drop a tomato, you're likely to bruise it.   You can bruise your knee or bruise
someone's feelings — if you tell your friend you don't like her novel, you’ll bruise her ego.
