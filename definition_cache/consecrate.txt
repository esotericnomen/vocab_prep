Consecrate means to make holy or to dedicate to a higher purpose. You need to consecrate a building
to turn it into a church, but you can also consecrate a week in New York City to the pursuit of the
perfect bagel.

The secr part of consecrate comes from the Latin sacer sacred. Remember that something consecrated
is dedicated to God and thus sacred. And then remember that the meanings of words tend to stretch;
over time this one moved from dedicated to God to dedicated to whatever: jelly donuts, the perfect
tan, finding a solution to Rubik's Cube.
