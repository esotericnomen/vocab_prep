To underscore is to draw special attention to a fact, idea, or situation. When you're involved in a
debate, it’s wise to underscore the points that best support your argument.

Literally, underscore means “to underline,” or draw a line beneath a word to emphasize it. In
common speech, to underscore something is to call attention to it. If a worker sustained an injury
on the job, for instance, the event would underscore the need for workplace safety. Underscore is
also used to mean  emphasize. During a job interview, you want to underscore any experience that
relates to the job you are applying for.
