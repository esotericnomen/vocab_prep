Orientation is all about the direction you're facing. A house can have an east-facing orientation.
Freshman orientation starts you off in a good direction. Your political orientation means your
political outlook.

Orientation is a relatively new word that was derived in the 19th century from orient, which means
to point yourself in a specific direction. Hiking with map and compass is sometimes called
orienteering, referring to hikers' use of those tools to orient themselves.
