Frolicsome is having a merry time of it. Picture frolicsome girls and boys playing tag, running
through the meadow, laughing and rolling in the grass.

Feeling gleeful and energetic as you ice skate with your friends? So spin like an Olympic skater
who's going for the gold, suddenly start a race, or act like a clown, pretending to fall on the ice.
You are feeling frolicsome Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; happy and lighthearted, laughing along with the people
you are amusing. When you are frolicsome, you frolic, or act playfully to have fun.
