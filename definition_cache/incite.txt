To incite is to cause to act or occur. Violent words can incite violent actions which, in turn,
might incite public outcry against violence.

Incite comes from a Latin verb meaning to move into action and if you incite someone to do
something, that is exactly how to describe it. Usually it is used in a negative context. Radical and
intolerant teachings can incite hatred in those who listen. And if a government restricts its people
too much, it can incite unrest and rebellion in the population.
