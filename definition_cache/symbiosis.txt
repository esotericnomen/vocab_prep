Symbiosis, a noun, tells about the relationship between living things that helps all of them stay
alive, like the symbiosis between bees that eat nectar from flowers that get cross-pollinated when
the bees move from one to the next.

To correctly pronounce symbiosis, accent the third syllable: sim-be-OH-sis. The prefix syn comes
from the Greek word together and bios means life. So symbiosis means a living together. Things that
live in symbiosis depend on one another, like the clown fish and anemone that protect one another
from ocean predators, or the symbiosis between a dairy farmer and one who grows hay, trading milk
for hay bales that feed the cows.
