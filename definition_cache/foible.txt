If you repeat foible out loud enough times, it sounds so funny that you can laugh at it and maybe
remember to laugh at the odd and distinctive weaknesses of others â€” the foible or two or a hundred
that we all have.

Sometimes a foible helps make a person who they are, even if the foible, or weakness (feeble is a
close relative), is a little odd. Synonyms for foible in a negative sense are failing, shortcoming,
and in a more positive sense quirk, eccentricity. It can likewise be annoying or endearing. Most
people have a foible, or idiosyncrasy, that stands out to others, but interestingly, a person rarely
sees his or her own characteristic foible.
