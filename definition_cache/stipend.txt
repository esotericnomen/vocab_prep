A stipend is a fixed, regular payment, usually meant to pay for something specific. It's kind of
like an allowance, but for grownups — a college scholarship might include a stipend each semester
for books, for example.

Coming from the Latin stipendium, which means “tax, pay, or gift,” the noun stipend is defined
as a regular, unchanging payment usually given as reward for services, but sometimes given as an
allowance with no services or expectations attached. A summer internship that does not offer a full
salary might instead include a weekly stipend that covers transportation and lunch costs. Synonyms
include salary and payment.
