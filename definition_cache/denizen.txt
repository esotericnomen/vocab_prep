A denizen is an inhabitant or frequenter of a particular place: a citizen of a country, a resident
in a neighborhood, a maven of a museum, a regular at a bar, or, even, a plant that is naturalized in
a region.

The noun denizen comes from words that mean “from” and “within” and is related to
“citizen.”  Denizen can be used when talking about any person or group of people that have a
specific relationship with a place. It was historically used to refer to foreigners who were either
naturalized or becoming citizens but now it is used much more generally, as in: The denizens of my
aunt’s neighborhood all have contracts with the same gardener.
