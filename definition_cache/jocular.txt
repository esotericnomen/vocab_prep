Do you like to make a lot of jokes? Are you often silly? Are you usually happy? If so, then you are
a jocular person.

Being jocular has to do with being both jokey and fun. A jocular suggestion is not a serious
suggestion Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; it's a joke. Some people are more jocular than others: anyone who is
ultra-serious and always frowning is not jocular. A comedian makes a job of being jocular. Class
clowns can't stop being jocular, though the teacher might just see them as obnoxious. Being jocular
is usually considered a good thing: it's not just about making a lot of jokes; it's about being
happy and pleasant to be around.
