The verb saturate means to cause something to be fully soaked to the point where it can't take on
anything else. A heavy rainstorm can saturate the ground, leaving puddles on the lawn because no
more water can be absorbed.

The word saturate comes from the Latin word saturatus, meaning to fill full, sate, drench. Saturate
is often used to describe the aftermath of a big rainstorm, but other things can be saturated as
well. If you're a workaholic, you might saturate all your free time with work, leaving no time to
spend with your family. In chemistry, saturate describes causing one substance, like a solution, to
take on the greatest amount of another substance.
