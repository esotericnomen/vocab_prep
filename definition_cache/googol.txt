A googol is a famously huge number, literally ten to the one hundredth power. A math teacher might
offer extra credit to students who correctly write out the digits of a googol on the blackboard.

If you want to write out a googol, write the number one followed by one hundred zeros.
Mathematicians sometimes use the idea of a googol to illustrate the difference between an enormous
number -- one that's too large to imagine -- and infinity. The word googol was invented by the young
nephew of mathematician Edward Kasner, one of the authors of the 1940 book Mathematics and the
Imagination.
