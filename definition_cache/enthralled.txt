You are enthralled when filled with delight and wonder at something, to the point where time seems
to stand still. Creators of day time soap operas count on viewers being enthralled to make their
money.

There's a transporting quality to the act of being enthralled, as though you have been, quite
literally, whisked away. This is not surprising, given the origin of the word, which comes from two
Latin words, en, to make or put in, and thrall, to hold in mental or moral bondage. So the next time
a movie or book (or daytime soap) enthralls you, remember you are indeed being kidnapped in some
way.
