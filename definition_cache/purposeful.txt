Something purposeful is done on purpose: it's meant to achieve an aim.

Lots of things happen accidentally or randomly, but other things have a purpose. Such things can be
called purposeful. Going to college, starting a family, giving to a charity, and adopting a dog are
all purposeful acts. People have a reason for doing them, and they want to accomplish something
specific. Purposeful things are thought-out and intentional.
