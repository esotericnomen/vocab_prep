Finery is fancy and expensive clothing and jewelry. A lot of high school students look forward to
the prom as a chance to dress up in their finery.

Your fanciest clothes are finery, especially if they're elaborate or pricey. Many people dress in
finery to attend formal weddings, wearing long gowns and well-tailored tuxedos. The fancy shoes,
hats, necklaces, and ties are all also considered to be finery. The word came into use around 1670,
literally meaning something that is fine, from the high quality meaning of fine.
