Slither means to move in a sideways motion, usually silently. Snakes, of all kinds, slither, from
the original snake in the Garden of Eden, to that untrustworthy-looking individual who approaches
you in the street.

Slither comes from the Old English term slidrian, meaning to slide on a loose or gravely surface.
While slide is in some ways similar to slither, it lacks its truly nasty moral and physical
associations. It's a safe bet that slitherers do not have your best interests at heart.
