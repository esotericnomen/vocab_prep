Procurement is the act of getting something you need. Save it for when you need to sound serious,
like if you're in the military.

Procurement is the noun form of the verb procure which means to acquire, but procurement often has
military connotations, such as: The procurement of the weapons for the war is vital. It also means
acquiring something that was extra hard to get, and you can use it when you want to sound formal: I
will work on the procurement of some more lemonade for all of us. Sound extra fancy by quoting the
British poet John Dryden from way back in 1717: They think it done/ By her procurement.
