To wean yourself from something is to gradually eliminate that thing from your life. You may want to
wean yourself from watching too much TV, drinking two pots of coffee every morning, or obsessively
reading the celebrity columns.

To wean an infant — human or animal — you gradually reduce consumption of mother’s milk or
bottled milk until the little one is no longer nursing or bottle-feeding. If you want to wean
yourself from eating chocolate chip cookies, go from eating eight a day to only seven for the next
few days, then to six for a few days and so on until you're no longer eating any chocolate chip
cookies.
