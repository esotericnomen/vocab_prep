To dilate something is to make it wider. When the light fades, the pupil of your eye will dilate,
meaning it looks bigger.

The verb dilate comes from the Latin word dilatare, which means “enlarge” or “spread out.”
When something stretches, expands, or becomes wider, it is said to dilate. Usually the word dilate
is used when the opening of something circular becomes larger, but every so often you might hear
someone refer to the need to dilate someone's understanding of quantum physics, global warming,
livestock breeding, or any other topic.
