Slick describes a smooth, effortless style. How did that Girl Scout talk you into buying so many
boxes of cookies? It must have been her slick sales pitch.

A great salesman is often described as slick Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; he or she seems more like a friend than
someone trying to sell you something. Things that are smooth and glossy can also be called slick,
like the surface of a glass table or an icy patch on the sidewalk. Slick is also a verb, meaning to
smooth, like when you slick back your hair. The oldest meaning of slick is shiny, and in the 1620s,
it was even the name of a kind of cosmetic.
