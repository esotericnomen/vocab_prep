Use the noun choreography to describe the plan for how dancers will move on a stage during a show,
play, or dance. You might particularly love the choreography in the movie West Side Story.

You can use the word choreography to mean dance or ballet, but its specific meaning is the notation
a choreographer makes on paper as she plans out the complex movements and steps made by dancers.
Choreography is particularly important in musical theater, ballet, opera, and dance recitals. The
Greek roots of choreography are khoreia, dance, and graphein, to write.
