To knead is to massage, as you might knead a sore muscle to relieve the pain or knead bread dough
before baking it.

Knead, pronounced “need,” comes from Old English, and its meaning has changed little over time.
Knead is sometimes used to describe a cat’s behavior of repeatedly pushing its paws (and claws)
into soft surfaces — almost like it’s kneading dough. We’re pretty sure cats did the same
thing long ago when folks spoke Old English, but there’s no word on whether knead was used to
describe this behavior back then.
