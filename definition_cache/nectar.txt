Delicious, sweet, and special, nectar is the best juice you can imagine. When the ancient Greeks
visualized the gods having a party on their Olympian lawns, they saw nectar in their cups.

Nectar was originally used to describe the drinks of the gods, but regular old humans need the good
stuff too. Serious wine lovers would describe their drink as nectar, while the serious raw food
eater might save the term for a ginger-beet-cayenne juice. If you ask the hummingbird, she would
give you a very tiny straw and direct you to the nectaries of a flower.
