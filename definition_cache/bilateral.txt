When something is bilateral it has two sides or it affects both sides of something. Discussions
between two political parties are called bilateral because both sides get to share their views.

Bilateral comes from Latin: bi means two and lateralis means belonging to the side. Debates about
issues can be described as bilateral Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; as long as people on both sides get to speak.
However, bilateral can describe anything with two sides, like some of the organs in the body: the
brain, heart and lungs all have two distinct sides.
