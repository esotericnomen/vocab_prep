A church is where you go for a public religious service. On Easter, some people go to church to
pray.

Church derives from the Greek word kuriakon (doma) meaning Lord's (house). A public building or
place mainly used for worship, a church can be modest in structure and appearance or large and
ornate, with stained glass windows and a grand interior. Inside a church, you are said to attend
church, which is a service given by a religious official that helps guide worship. Church can also
refer to the group of people you see regularly at Sunday's service.
