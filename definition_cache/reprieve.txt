A reprieve is a break in or cancellation of a painful or otherwise lousy situation. If you're being
tortured, a reprieve is a break from whatever's tormenting you.

For some, a night at the opera is a night of punishing boredom during which the only reprieve is the
intermission. For others, it's baseball that feels like torture. The seventh-inning stretch is the
only reprieve from a night of endless waiting. Often, you'll hear reprieve used when a court or
governor decides not to execute a prisoner. That prisoner is given a reprieve and will be allowed to
live. He probably won't get a reprieve from prison, though, unless he's found innocent.
