A liability is a debt or obligation or a personal flaw that stands in your way. A company's
liabilities are simply the debts on its ledger, but a personal liability might be your grandfather's
membership in the Ku Klux Klan.

Depending on how you use it, the word liability has very different meanings. In a business or
financial sense, a liability is simply a debt or fiscal obligation, like a mortgage or a loan. A
limited liability company means if the company fails, the partners are on the hook for only what
they initially invested in the company. A personal liability, however, is some element of your past,
your character, or your behavior that damages your reputation.
