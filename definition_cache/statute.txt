A statute is a formal law or rule. Whether it's enacted by a government, company, or other
organization, a statute is typically written down.

Local governments can pass all kinds of statutes, or written laws, to govern their citizens. A
city's government might try to restrict the consumption of alcoholic beverages in public, or make it
illegal to pet cats on the weekends. Of course, silly statutes like no cat-petting on weekends can
be pretty hard to pass.
