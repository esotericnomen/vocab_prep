Witticism describes something funny that someone says, like a pun or little joke. You may have heard
that it is good to start off a speech with witticism because if you make the audience laugh, it'll
help them — and you — relax.

English playwright and poet John Dryden coined the word witticism in the seventeenth century,
combining the words witty and criticism to come up with a word to describe a clever quip that has a
hint of sharpness or irony. A witticism is typically a one-liner that humorously sums up the current
situation — with a little bit of attitude thrown in.
