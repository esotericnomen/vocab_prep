Something that's handed down from your father is an example of patrimony, like your name or your
antique dining room table.

Use the noun patrimony to describe an inheritance, especially if it comes from your father's side of
the family through many generations. If your great-great-grandfather built the house you live in, it
is your patrimony. The Latin origin of the word patrimony is pater, or father, plus mÄ¹?nium, state
or condition.
