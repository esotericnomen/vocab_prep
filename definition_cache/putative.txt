You might be the putative leader of your lacrosse team, even if someone else holds the title of
captain.  Putative means to be known as something by reputation, or assumed to be something, or
generally accepted.

Every once in a while, a putative planet is reported in the news, which we get very excited about
and which usually turns out to be an illusion. But in 2005, an astronomer discovered what appears to
be a new planet beyond Neptune. But is this putative planet for real? There is always some
doubt––something not quite official––about putative things.
