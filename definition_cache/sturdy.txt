Describe something that is firmly constructed or strongly made as sturdy. That house you built was
not sturdy at all. It blew down in the last wind storm. Fortunately, it was only a dog house and the
dog wasn't in it.

Physical strength and robust health can also be described as sturdy. Your grandmother is pushing 80,
but she is still pretty sturdy if she can beat you at tennis. The adjective sturdy can also describe
something (or someone) determined, firm, stalwart, and steady. Hopefully, you and your siblings have
a sturdy relationship, so you can withstand all the bickering over who gets to ride shotgun in the
car.
