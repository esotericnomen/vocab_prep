Something that is fragrant has a nice smell. What makes a smell nice is subjective, or course. You
might find bowl of dried lavender to be fragrant, but your dog might prefer a pile of horse poop.

Fragrant things emit good smells, like flowers, trees, or cooking. Maybe you find fresh cut grass
fragrant, or the smell of summer rain on asphalt. When a smell gets too intense, however, it loses
its fragrancy. Someone doused in cologne has bypassed fragrancy for noxiousness. But he's right on
one count: the people we are attracted to are almost always fragrant to us.
