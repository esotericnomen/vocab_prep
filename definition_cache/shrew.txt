Use the noun shrew — at your own risk — to refer to a woman who is argumentative, nagging, and
ill tempered.

The noun shrew can also refer to a mouse-like animal with tiny eyes, a long snout, and a sharp bite.
Superstitions associated with this small mammal led people in the thirteenth century to use the word
shrew to describe a spiteful person, male or female. The word later came to be used to describe a
nagging, ill-tempered woman, as in William Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew. Unless you are a
famous dead author, however, you may want to steer clear of this one in conversation: it’s
considered offensive.
