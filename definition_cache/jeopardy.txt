To be in jeopardy is to be in danger. Eating three plates of nachos a day may improve your chances
of winning your office's nacho-eating contest; unfortunately, it could also put your health in
jeopardy.

Jeopardy is a state of being, so this word is almost always preceded by the preposition in. The
phrase in jeopardy is just one of several ways to convey that someone is in trouble. You can also
try at risk, in danger, or â&euro;&rdquo; if you're into idioms â&euro;&rdquo; on thin ice, out on
a limb, or up the creek without a paddle.
