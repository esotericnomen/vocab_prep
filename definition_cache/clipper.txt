Use the noun clipper when you're talking about an old-fashioned ship with many masts and sails.

Although clippers were mostly used in the nineteenth century for carrying goods across oceans, you
can still see them in various harbors, restored or reproduced from the the original clippers. The
name clipper came from the verb clip, which can mean to move or run rapidly. An entirely different
meaning of clipper is the kind you use to trim your toenails or the weeds along the edge of your
driveway.
