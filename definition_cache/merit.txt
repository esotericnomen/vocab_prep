Merit is another way of saying deserve. The National Merit Scholarship program is based on
merit––students whose SAT scores are high enough deserve to be in the program. If kids seems to
be getting in who hadn't even taken the SATs––that would merit an investigation.

You will often hear the phrases merit-based promotion and merit-based pay, which come up when
employees are pushing against a system in which time on the job––and not job
performance––determines when workers are promoted and how much they are paid. Using the word
merit suggests impartiality and objectivity––such as when you swear off a prejudiced approach to
something and vow to judge it on its merits.
