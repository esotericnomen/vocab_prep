Chastise is a fancy word for telling someone that something they did was really bad. If you pick
your nose, your mom's gonna yell at you. If you do it in front of the Queen of England, your mom
will chastise you.

Back in the Middle Ages, chastise used to also come with a beatingâ&euro;&ldquo;â&euro;&ldquo;that
sense of the word has passed, and in fact, people tend to use chastise when they are trying to
accuse someone else of overreacting. You're chastising me for forgetting to feed the cat, but it's
not like the cat died!
