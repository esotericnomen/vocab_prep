Veracity sounds like some kind of disease you don't want to catch, but in fact, it means
truthfulness. If you question the veracity of a statement or story, you wonder whether it is
truthful or accurate.

Veracity is linked to the adjective veracious or truthful. But don't confuse veracious with
voracious. A voracious person eats very large amounts of food. If you were veracious, or truthful,
you'd tell them they look fat.
