An enormity is something extreme or huge, almost beyond comprehension. If you call having to paint
the house all by yourself an enormity, your friends might take pity on you and show up with brushes
and rollers.

Something that's enormous can be good â&euro;&rdquo; a huge paycheck! â&euro;&rdquo; or bad, such
as a tumor. But when it comes to enormity, some word lovers are up in arms. The word originally
meant a crime, so some people think it should only be used to describe wickedness or lack of morals.
Others can't resist the word's similarity to enormous and apply it to anything vast, positive or
negative.
