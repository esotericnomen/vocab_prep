Ursine means having similarities to bears. Telling a woman that she has ursine qualities will not
get you a second date. In fact, saying that a woman resembles a bear will probably get you slapped.

Ursine means to have bear-like qualities: big, furry, muscular, and lumbering. If you're using the
word to describe a big, hulking football player it might be perceived as a compliment. If, on the
other hand, you use ursine to describe a woman, she wouldn't be flattered at all. Ursine originated
back in the 16th century, from the Latin word for â&euro;&rdquo; you guessed it â&euro;&rdquo;
bear.
