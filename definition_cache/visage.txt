Visage is a literary term for referring to someone's face or facial features. You may notice that
some face creams use the word visage to try to sound fancier than they are.

A famous use of visage is in Shakespeare's Julius Caesar. Brutus says: O conspiracy/Shamest thou to
show thy dangerous brow by night,/When evils are most free? O, then by day/Where wilt thou find a
cavern dark enough/To mask thy monstrous visage? Now there's a quote that will help you remember the
meaning of visage, and even give you nightmares.
