If you're intuitive, you can probably guess what this word means just by looking at it. No? Maybe
you're not so intuitive, after all. Intuitive means having the ability to understand or know
something without any direct evidence or reasoning process.

Psychics are intuitive. So are mothers when they know you're lying. A process can be said to be
intuitive as well, if it can be easily learned without any prior training Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; like an
easy-to-learn software program. In human beings, intuitiveness is often thought of as something more
mystical, as in the ability psychics have to predict the future.
