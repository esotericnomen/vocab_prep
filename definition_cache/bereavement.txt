If you have ever mourned someone's passing, you know about bereavement — the period of sorrow that
follows the death of a loved one.

Bereavement comes from an Old English word that means “rob,” “deprive,” and “seize.”
When a loved one is taken, usually through death, those who remain are often left in a state of
bereavement.  Bereavement is not only reserved for the death of a human family member or friend, but
the loss of a pet can also induce bereavement.
