When you've come to the end of a weekend with your best friends, it's time for a leave-taking, or
time to say goodbye.

All good things come to an end, and when that happens, you can describe it as a leave-taking.
Hugging your visitors goodbye, waving as their car departs Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; these are all parts of
leave-taking. It can be simple and polite, like when you say goodbye to co-workers at the end of the
day, or a more poignant leave-taking, like when you leave your entire family to travel in Africa for
a year.
