When something is exciting, it is full of activity and gets your blood pumping. Anything causing
excitement is exciting.

If your heart is racing and youâ&euro;&trade;re thrilled, exhilarated, or jumping up and down with
anticipation, something must be exciting. Different people find different things exciting. A close
football game is exciting for fans. Being in love is exciting for just about anyone. Learning
something new, whether French or juggling, is exciting. An action movie is supposed to be exciting
â&euro;&rdquo; if it's not, it must not be very good. When you have exciting news, you can't wait
to share it.
