Someone who suffers, or is even killed, for his or her political or religious beliefs is called a
martyr.

Martin Luther King Jr. is often called a martyr in connection with the American civil rights
movement. A martyr is also someone who chooses to be put to death rather than renounce his or her
religious beliefs, as the story of Saint Stephen tells. In the figurative sense, if you are a martyr
to headaches, you suffer from them. Sometimes, martyr is used negatively to refer to someone who
chooses to suffer when there is no need to do so.
