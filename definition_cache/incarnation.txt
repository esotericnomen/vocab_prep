Incarnation is the embodiment of a god on earth. Or — when it comes to reincarnation: if you are a
garbage collector in this life, you might get to be royalty in your next incarnation.

Incarnation comes from the Latin incarnatus, which means “to make flesh.” The word incarnation
came to life in religious contexts and is used when talking about gods and deities that take on
human or animal forms. More generally, the word can be used to refer to anything or anyone taking on
a new life — the new season of a sitcom could promise a new incarnation for one of its characters,
or a former fashion trend could come back as a new incarnation.
