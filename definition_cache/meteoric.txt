Because meteors move through the sky so quickly, we often refer to something moving very fast as
meteoric. A newly-popular singer might be said to experience a meteoric rise to the top. (The fall
can be meteoric, too.)

The -ic suffix on a word creates an adjective meaning with the characteristics of. So meteoric means
“having the characteristics of a meteor.” Both words take their origin from the Greek meteōros,
meaning high up. By the way, a shooting star is meteoric, being a meteor that is burning up as it
plunges through the earth's atmosphere.
