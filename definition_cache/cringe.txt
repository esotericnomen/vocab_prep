When you cringe, your body language shows you don't like what you see and hear. You close your eyes
and grimace. You may even jerk your body away from the offensive sight or sound, like the old
picture of you in an awkward stage that makes you cringe whenever you see it.

Whether it's a song you hate or someone mentioning an embarrassing moment from the past, you cringe
at things that are unpleasant. If you think about the way your body involuntarily flinches or bends
in those situations, you won’t be surprised to learn that the word cringe can be traced back to
the Old English word cringan, meaning “give way, fall (in battle), become bent.” That’s
exactly what your body does when you cringe!
