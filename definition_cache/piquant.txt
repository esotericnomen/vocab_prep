Feeling a little saucy? Perhaps a bit provocative â€” but in a good way? Then it's safe to say your
personality is a little piquant.

Coming to us from the French word piquer, which means to prick, something that's piquant certainly
piques your interest. Someone who's piquant engages you with charm and wit. A story that's filled
with piquant details has plenty of juicy, provocative points. And grandma's homemade gravy? It's
certainly zesty and piquant, even with all the lumps.
