The adjective earthy runs the gamut from crunchy to crude. You could use earthy to describe bohemian
fashion or a vulgar comedian. Just don't use it to describe our planet.

Adding one letter y to earth changes earth's status from a noun to an adjective. And what a
versatile adjective it is! You could use it in a more literal way, like the earthy smell coming from
the vegetable garden. Or, you could use it in a more figurative way Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; like to describe
someone who wears Birkenstock sandals and grows her own bean sprouts. Earthy can also be used to
describe someone who tends to be gross or vulgar, but this use of the word is somewhat euphemistic.
