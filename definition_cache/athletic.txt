If you're athletic, you have a natural talent for sports and fitness. You might jump nonstop through
a strenuous aerobics class, then go run a few miles, and top it off shooting hoops with the
basketball team.

If you're a champion speed skater, you've most definitely got an athletic build, and while skinny
jeans may not look so great on you, you probably look pretty good in running shorts. You know the
ancient Greeks loved athletic competitions Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; after all, they invented the Olympics.
Fittingly enough, the word athletic goes back to the Greek word athlein, meaning to compete for a
prize.
