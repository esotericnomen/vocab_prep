If you are getting your eyes checked, a doctor is checking on your vision â€” or your ability to
see. But if you have visions of unicorns romping over rainbows, that's a whole other issue that the
eye doctor can't address.

The noun vision describes how well you can see, but it can also refer to things you may see, but
that aren't physically there. Sometimes people claim to have religious visions of God, angels, the
Virgin Mary, and so on. The word can also be used to describe something that is lovely: The bride
was a vision in white.
