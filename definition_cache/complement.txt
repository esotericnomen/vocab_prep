A complement is something that makes up a satisfying whole with something else. Those shiny red
shoes you just bought complement your shiny red purse.

Complement comes from the Latin complementum, something that fills up or completes. Complement keeps
both the e and the meaning. It's also a verb; if you and your partner complement each other, you
make a perfect pair. Something that complements completes or adds a little something.
