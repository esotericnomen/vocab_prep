Brocade is a thick, weighty, fancy material with a raised pattern. You might see an opera singer
wearing a dress made of brocade fabric, or you might see it used to create ornate silk cushions.

Brocade comes from the Italian word brocco, meaning twisted thread. Brocade fabric has a rich,
ornate slightly old-fashioned feel to it. You might hear the word brocade used to describe the
curtains in the homes of wealthy old women who may or may not have bodies or other horrible secrets
in the unused upstairs rooms. Brocade can also be verb that describes the action of weaving a design
into fabric.
