Drivel is useless, boring information. If you drivel, you talk stupidly or actually drool. Your
parent might think the articles in your favorite fashion magazine are drivel.

Etymologists suspect drivel comes to us from the Old Norse word draf, meaning malt dregs. This would
make sense, given that drivel is usually talk or writing about as useless as dregs. If you don't
prepare for an oral report, the unfortunate result may be that your teacher finds your disorganized
ramblings to be pure drivel. Drivel also means to dribble saliva. If a friendly dog licks your hand,
leaving it wet and gooey, you can assume he driveled on it.
