That blissful grin on your face? It could be described as beatific, meaning it projects a peaceful
sense of joy.

If you have a beatific smile on your face, then the happiness it shows is the real thing. This word
doesnâ&euro;&trade;t describe phony smiles or quick grins that show a little amusement. Use
beatific to describe something characterized by complete and perfect joy. Itâ&euro;&trade;s often
used to describe a smile, but it can be used to describe anything in a state of bliss.
