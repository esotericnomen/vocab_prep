Someone you adore gets put on a pedestal. Considering your fear of germs, when you told me that you
had shared a toothbrush — I knew you must adore her!

Adore comes from the Latin word adorare, meaning “to worship.”  So when you adore someone, it's
more than just a crush. However, like many words of strong emotion, adore gets used in lighter
situations as well. Your aunt tells me you just adore the miniature fruitcakes she sends you every
holiday.
