A self-righteous person thinks their beliefs and morals are better than everyone else's. If you're
quite sure the charity of others pales in comparison with yours, you might be self-righteous.

Join the Old English words self, meaning one's own person, and rightwise, meaning virtuous, and
you've got somebody who thinks very highly of their own morality. A self-righteous person thinks
they can do no wrong, and goes about with a holier-than-thou attitude, judging and scrutinizing
everyone else. A fur designer may view PETA activists as self-righteous when they picket his fashion
show. You may consider a friend self-righteous when it comes to musical taste.
