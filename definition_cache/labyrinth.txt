A labyrinth is a structure with many connected paths or passages in which it is hard to find your
way. In figurative use, a labyrinth is a complicated situation: our tax code is a labyrinth of rules
and regulations.

In Greek mythology, the Labyrinth was the structure built for King Minos of Crete to confine the
Minotaur, a monster with the head of a bull and the body of a man. The word maze is a near synonym
for labyrinth, and is also used figuratively, as in, After war broke out, trying to figure out how
to get a visa to leave the country was like navigating a maze, a veritable labyrinth of wrong turns
and false hope.
