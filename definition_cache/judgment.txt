Judgment is the mental ability to understand something, form an opinion and reach a decision. You
have great judgment of character, which is why your friends ask you to meet their significant others
when things get serious.

A decision is a judgment, unless you let a coin toss decide for you. Use your judgment to determine
how much salt to add, or the safest way home. In court, the judge's official decision is called the
judgment, and if you condemn someone, even if you're not a judge, we say you've passed judgment. If
you need to explain many parts of the story before your innocence will be clear, ask your listener
not to rush to judgment.
