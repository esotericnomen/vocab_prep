Was that a he or a she? If someone has an androgynous look, it is hard to tell whether he or she is
male or female.

You can see the meaning of androgynous in its parts: In Greek, andros means male and gyn means
female. Someone who is androgynous has both male and female characteristics, and therefore may be
mistaken for being a member of the opposite gender. Don't confuse androgynous with unisex, which
describes objects or places used by both males and females, like a unisex restroom.
