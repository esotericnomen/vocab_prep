Don't call a coin collector a philatelist. That word is reserved for people who collect stamps. If
you're going to become a philatelist, start saving those old envelopes.

The phil- at the beginning of philatelist gives you a hint as to its meaning: it means love
Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; a Francophile is a person who loves France. The Greek ateleia meant exemption from
payment, an exemption that was marked by a stamp. So a philatelist is literally a person who loves
stamps. The world of the philatelist is a strange and tiny one. It makes one wonder why someone
starts collecting stamps in the first place. Maybe it's the pretty little pictures.
