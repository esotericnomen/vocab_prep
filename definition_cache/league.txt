The two meanings of league are quite different — either it’s a group or federation joined for a
common purpose (say, your bowling league or the League of Nations) or it’s a rough measurement of
about three miles, usually at sea.

One would hope that two such different meanings of the same word would have some deep connection far
back in word history, but it does not seem to be the case here. The word meaning an agreement of
groups appears to be related to the French word ligue, also found in ligature (thing that ties),
while the league of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (an excellent adventure book if you’re in the
mood) is from Middle English. We call words like these homographs — since spelling is all they
seem to share!
