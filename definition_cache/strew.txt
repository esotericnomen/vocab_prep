When you strew something, you scatter it all over the place. At a wedding, for example, the flower
child's job is to strew the path with petals.

One of the scariest parts of The Wizard of Oz is when the winged monkeys pounce on the Scarecrow and
strew his insides all over the forest floor. It's a tricky word, because it sounds the same in the
present as it does in the past. The monkeys strew the straw then and might strew it now: in any
case, the straw will be strewn all over. After the clambake, the beach was strewn with empty shells
and beer bottles. After  strewing all that stuff, they forgot to clean up.
