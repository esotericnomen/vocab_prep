Quaint means strange and unusual in an old-fashioned and charming way. It's a word you'd use to
describe a little store that sells tea cozies and antique tea services, or your grandmother's habit
of calling the radio the wireless.

There is a commonly used sarcastic sense of quaint––when something is run down or shabby and
you're trying to say something positive, you might substitute How...quaint for How...interesting. In
Middle English, this adjective meant clever or cunning. Its origin is Old French queinte, cointe,
from Latin cognitus known, from cognōscere to learn.
