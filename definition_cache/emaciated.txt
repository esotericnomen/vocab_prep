Someone who is dangerously skinny and skeletal-looking can be described as emaciated. It's probably
how you'd start to look after a few weeks in the wilderness with only berries and bugs for dinner.

The adjective emaciated evolved from the Latin emaciatus, meaning to â&euro;&oelig;make lean, waste
away.â&euro;? An emaciated person or animal isn't just thin. They're bony, gaunt, and most likely
undernourished, often from illness. So if an emaciated stray cat shows up on your doorstep, give it
a bowl of milk and maybe pay a visit to the vet.
