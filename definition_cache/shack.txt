A shack is a small, rundown building used as a shelter. To shack is to live somewhere. If you tell
your parents you want to shack up with your best friend, prepare to get grounded.

A shack is a tiny, crude shelter that one person might be living in. Itâ&euro;&trade;s not well
maintained, and it probably has peeling paint and a leaky roof. A shack is a big step below a house
and a small step above a refrigerator box. To shack is to live somewhere, especially somewhere
that's not nice. Shacking up is kind of like crashing on someoneâ&euro;&trade;s couch, or living
somewhere temporarily.
