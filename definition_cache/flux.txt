The noun flux describes something that constantly changes. If your likes, dislikes, attitudes,
dreams, and even friends are changing all the time, you may be in flux.

Flux can also describe being unsure about how to respond to something while you're waiting for
something else to happen. Suppose you just had a great job interview and feel confident that you'll
get an offer. In the meantime, your friend invites you to go to Australia with her. You don't know
what to do because you don't want to miss that call Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; or Sydney! You're in flux until
you hear from the potential employer.
