Marked is an adjective meaning “clear” or “noticeable.” Filling your living room with
pictures of pandas will show your marked  appreciation for all things panda.

The adjective marked can have several senses. In addition to meaning “very noticeable,” it can
be used in relation to the noun mark, as in “to show a mark.” You may have also heard the
expression a “marked man.” Marked in this sense means to have been chosen for punishment or a
bad ending. Trip your opponent in this year’s field day sack race, and you will likely find
yourself a marked man at the next contest.
