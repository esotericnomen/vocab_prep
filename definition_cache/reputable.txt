Want the real scoop on your favorite singer's latest romance? Then you should probably find a more
reputable source than the tabloids â€” meaning someone with a better reputation, in this case for
telling the truth.

That's the thing with reputable reputations. People know you can be trusted, that you're honest and
not trying to pull one over on anybody. Reputable institutions usually have a history of excellent
service or outstanding work, and always come highly recommended. Reputable used car salesmen may
seem scarce. The word reputable actually has a good deal of reputability itself, since it's been in
standard use since the 17th century.
