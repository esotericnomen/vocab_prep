Whether it's a bright light or a fault, glaring things are obvious. You just can't miss them.

Something glaring is obvious to everyone. Sometimes, there's a glaring light that's in your eyes,
such as the glaring beams of the sun. Other times, it could be a glaring fault. For example, if
you're a very short basketball player, your height is something everyone knows you have to overcome:
it's a glaring problem for that sport. Things that are glaring in this way are almost always bad:
there aren't any glaring ice cream cones or puppies. You can't avoid looking at things that are
glaring, but you wish you could.
