You may encounter a vulpine smile, a vulpine movie director, or a vulpine laugh — whatever it is,
be on guard. The word vulpine describes something that is crafty like a fox.

The word vulpine traces back to the word vulpes, the Latin word for “fox,” and the word can be
used literally to describe something directly related to a fox. Nowadays, however, you’re more
likely to hear it used to describe something that has the characteristics of a fox. Many cultures
associate the fox with cunning and shrewdness, and the word vulpine has come to be used to describe
something that has a crafty, intelligent, slightly predatory quality.
