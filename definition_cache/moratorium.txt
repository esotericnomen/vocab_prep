A moratorium is the suspension of a particular activity––you could have a moratorium on fishing,
baking, the use of candles, the wearing of matching socks.

Generally, moratoriums go into effect when something becomes seen as being not okay for now, but
might go back to being okay later. After the water fountain started to burble up green sludge, the
principal put a moratorium on drinking any water at school until the fountains were fixed and the
water tested.
