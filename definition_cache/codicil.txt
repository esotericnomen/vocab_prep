A codicil is a supplement to a will. If your will is already written and you want to alter it, you
add a codicil.

When your seemingly ancient neighbor marries a woman less than half his age, you might notice that
his adult children suddenly stop coming to visit. This may be because he added a codicil to his will
granting his new wife access to all his riches. Getting your inheritance in writing is a good idea,
but a codicil can change everything.
