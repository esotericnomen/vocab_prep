A remittance is a payment that gets sent somewhere else. If you get a bill in the mail, you will
usually have at least a week to send your remittance.

To remit is to send money or make a payment and what you send is called remittance. Buying anything
from a website involves a remittance Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; usually from a grownup's credit card, just as
keeping your cell phone going requires a regular remittance to cover minutes and messages. If you go
on a trip and run out of money, you might need an emergency remittance for a plane or train ticket
to get home.
