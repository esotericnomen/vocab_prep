The word deploy is mainly used in military contexts and to refer to the strategic arrangement of
fighting forces.

The Latin plicāre means fold. By adding dis- to it, to get displicāre, we get the idea of an
unfolding, or distributing. This is the basis of the word deploy, and it gives us a good mental
image of the sending out, or unfolding, of troops in a military plan. To deploy means more than just
dispersing troops, however — there is usually a specific formation in mind, consistent with
military strategies. And you can deploy nonmilitary assets, too, like accounting teams before an IRS
audit.
