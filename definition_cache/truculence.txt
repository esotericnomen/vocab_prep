If you get into fights all of the time, you might be accused of truculence and sent for anger
management classes. Truculence is showing a fierce kind of aggression.

If your basketball team wins a game by sheer truculence, it means that they win not by skill or
talent, but by playing with ferocious aggression. It would be a dirty win, one with lots of fouls
and thrown elbows. Truculence comes from the Latin word for trux meaning fierce or wild.
