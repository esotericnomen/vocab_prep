A translucent material lets light pass through, but objects on the other side can't be seen clearly.
Think: Shrinky Dinks or stained glass.

In contrast, a transparent material allows you to clearly see the objects on the other side. Frosted
glass is translucent, and regular glass is transparent. But opaque glass doesn't let any light
through at all, and so you can't see through it. The adjective translucent is from Latin
translucens, from translucere to shine through.
