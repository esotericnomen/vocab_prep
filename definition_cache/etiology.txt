If you figure out the etiology of your friend's incessant hiccups, she'll be incredibly grateful,
because etiology means the cause of a disease or condition.

The noun etiology is usually used by doctors and researchers who study disease and other medical
topics. It means origin when you use it to describe illness or medical disorders, and it also refers
to the study of the way things are caused. This second definition of etiology includes the study of
disease, but you can use it to talk about the origins of anything at all.
