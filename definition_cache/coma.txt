Medically speaking, a coma is the state of protective deep sleep your body goes into when severely
injured, as in a car crash. Daytime soap operas would be lost without a good coma every few weeks.

Coma comes from the Greek koma meaning deep sleep. As with so many words with medical or scientific
origins, coma has been appropriated for a far wider range of uses. The zombie-like trance you fall
into at family get-togethers like Thanksgiving? That too is a coma, though your chances of recovery
are far better than from a real coma. Unless you happen to sit next to Aunt Sadie.
