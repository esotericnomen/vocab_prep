If you like the looks of the color and pattern formed by a bird’s feathers, then you like its
plumage.

The word plumage traces back to the French word plume, meaning feather, and it’s a way of
referring to all the feathers that form the color and patterns of a particular bird. For example,
birdwatchers study illustrations of birds so that they can recognize, say, a golden hawk in flight
by its plumage.
