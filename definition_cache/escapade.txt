An escapade is an adventure, tinged with a hint of danger. A road trip could be an escapade, or a
few weeks making a living as a professional gambler, or posing as your twin sister and taking a test
for her in math.

You'll notice the similarities between the words escapade and escape. Usually an escapade involves
some form of escape. If you cut class and spend the day at the beach, that's an escapade. If you cut
class to watch former figure-skating greats boogying to Broadway tunes on ice, that's an escapade at
the Ice Capades.
