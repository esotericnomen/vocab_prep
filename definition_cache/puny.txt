Are your muscles looking small, weak, and totally inferior? In other words, puny? Sounds like
somebody needs to eat more spinach.

Tiny, shrimpy, wimpy and totally unthreatening. That's puny in a nutshell Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; a very
small, totally lame looking nutshell. It's most often used to describe someone's inferior physique,
but can also apply to anything little that's not about to get in your way. A puny mountain would be
no challenge to an Olympic skier, just as a puny plate of hot dogs would be laughable to a world
speed-eating champion.
