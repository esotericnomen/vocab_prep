If you have ever tightened a bolt with a wrench, or tried to get the lid off a jar of strawberry
jam, then you have dealt with the concept of torque â€” a twisting action or a turning force.

The word torque, which rhymes with fork, is used in the field of physics as a measure of rotational
force. For example, how much strength does it take to move an object, such as a screwdriver, around
an axis, such as a screw? In ancient times, a torque was a necklace made of twisted metal. Now,
torque is commonly used to describe the power of sports cars and their ability to accelerate, since
car engines operate with rotating parts.
