Ever see someone talking to himself while on a stage? That's what you call a soliloquy â€” a
character's speech voicing his or her own thoughts as if to himself. Shakespeare's plays are full of
soliloquies.

The noun, soliloquy, comes from the Latin roots, solus alone plus loqui speak meaning a talking to
oneself. A soliloquy is a speech a character gives of his thoughts and reflections. Some of the most
famous lines in drama are taken from soliloquies. Take to be or not to be... and Tomorrow, and
tomorrow, and tomorrow, Creeps in this petty pace... as two examples of lines from soliloquies that
have tortured high school students around the globe. Not the Globe Theater, Silly.
