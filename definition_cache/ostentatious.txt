Reach for the adjective ostentatious when you want a flashy way to say â€” well, flashy or showy.

No one wants to be described as ostentatious, a word whose cousins include pretentious, flamboyant,
and gaudy. It originates from the Latin word ostentare, to display, but in English it's often used
for displays of the crass or vulgar sort. A rapper's diamond-encrusted teeth might be an
ostentatious display of bling, and someone wailing especially loudly at a funeral of a distant
acquaintance might be making an ostentatious show of sorrow.
