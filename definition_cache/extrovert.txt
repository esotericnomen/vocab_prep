An extrovert is a friendly person who enjoys talking to and being with other people. Extroverts love
parties, talking on the phone, meeting new people.

This noun is sometimes spelled extravert. It has a specialized sense in psychology, and its opposite
is introvert. As a psychological term, it was borrowed from German extravertiert, from the prefix
extra- outside, beyond plus Latin vertere to turn. Its opposite is introvert, which means shy or
turned inward.
