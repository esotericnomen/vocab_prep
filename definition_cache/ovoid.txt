Something that's shaped like an egg is an ovoid. If you want to impress your friends, call that
sculpture in the park that looks like an oval with a slightly pointed to an ovoid.

Ovoid can also be used as an adjective that means egg-shaped, as in the ovoid chocolates in a box of
candy. Ovoid comes from the Latin word ovum, meaning egg. The suffix -oid means like. When you
combine those, you can easily see how ovoid came to mean egg-like. To correctly pronounce ovoid,
accent the first syllable and give it the long o sound: OH-void.
