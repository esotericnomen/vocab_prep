To screech is to make a piercing, high-pitched sound. It can also be the sound itself. Want to hear
a screech? Take a little kid’s lollipop away.

A screech is another word for a scream, shriek, or cry. It’s not fun to listen to. If a woman in a
horror movie finds a bad guy in her closet, she’ll probably screech. If you surprise someone in
the middle of the night, expect a screech. Things can also screech, like when a car screeches to a
sudden stop at a red light.
