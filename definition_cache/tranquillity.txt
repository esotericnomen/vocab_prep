Tranquillity is a sense of peace and quiet. It is the feeling you have while sitting under a starry
sky, listening to the crickets. The aura of tranquility comes from the calm in the world, which
makes you feel you are without a care in the world.

Tranquillity is also sometimes spelled with one l as tranquility. Its roots are in the Latin trans
meaning exceedingly and quies meaning rest or quiet. Tranquil means calm, and something that is
exceedingly quiet or restful â&euro;&rdquo; a sunset or a rocking chair in the shade
â&euro;&rdquo; can give you a sense of tranquillity or peacefulness.
