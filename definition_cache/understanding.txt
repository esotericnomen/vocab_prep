To be understanding is to be sympathetic to someone’s woes. Understanding a concept means you get
it. Your understanding might be that your mother will always drive you to school if you miss the
bus.

The sum of your knowledge of a certain topic, is your understanding of it. This can change, or
deepen as you learn more. But being an understanding person doesn't take a lot of studying — it
takes opening your heart to appreciate what someone else feels or experiences. If someone says to
you, I thought we had an understanding, you must have done something unexpected. Here, understanding
means an agreement.
