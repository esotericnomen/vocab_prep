A tirade is a speech, usually consisting of a long string of violent, emotionally charged words.
Borrow and lose your roommate’s clothes one too many times, and you can bet you’ll be treated to
a heated tirade.

The noun tirade is related to the Italian word tirata, which means volley. So imagine a very angry
person lobbing harsh words and strings of profanity in your direction when you want to remember what
tirade means. Although, tirades don't necessarily have to include bad words — any long, drawn out
speech or epic declaration can be called a tirade.
