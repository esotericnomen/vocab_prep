Need a mental picture for the word droll? Think of one of those cute-homely troll dolls — blend
those two words together — doll and troll — and you get droll, a description of a figure that is
adorably strange and whimsically cute.

The word droll comes from the archaic French word drolle, referring to a jolly good fellow. The
French word comes perhaps from the Middle Dutch drolle, or imp. The word came into English as both
noun (funny person, buffoon) and adjective (funny, quaint, strange) in the 17th century.
