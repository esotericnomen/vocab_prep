If you get a snowstorm in the middle of July, you could say that you are experiencing “abnormal
weather.” Something that is abnormal is out of the ordinary, or not typical.

Abnormal is a combination of the Latin prefix ab which means “away from,” and the English word
normal. It essentially means “not normal,” or unusual.” Abnormal implies that whatever is
“not normal” is also undesirable. However, abnormal is sometimes used in a positive context. The
phrase “abnormal intelligence,” for instance, usually refers to someone with especially high
intelligence.
