The noun pomposity means super-sized self-confidence. A person who thinks he or she is better than
every else suffers from pomposity — and everyone in that person's life suffers, too.

Pomposity, pronounced pahm-POSS-ih-tee, isn't just for arrogant people. Things can have this
unpleasant quality, too. For example, the pomposity of an award ceremony that presents the winners
and judges as the most important people who ever lived will leave viewers cold. Language can also be
a victim of pomposity — when someone says, We dined at our beloved little bistro, another person
would say, We ate at our favorite neighborhood joint.
