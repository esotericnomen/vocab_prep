If your basketball team is undefeated, you could say that they were able to dominate the
competition. To dominate means to be in control or have the power to defeat.

Dominate is related to the word, domain which means home. While these words may not seem all that
similar, when you are the master of a home or thing, you dominate it. If you get angry, it is wise
to not let your feelings dominate you or your actions. Dominate can also mean to be most prominent.
If in the woods around your house, oak trees are the most common, you could say that oak trees
dominate in your forest.
