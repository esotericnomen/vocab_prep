Your body is everything that makes up your physical self, including your skin, bones, muscles, and
organs. Your whole body might hurt after a day spent learning to snowboard.

All animals have a body, and you can also describe some inanimate objects as having a body. For
example, a car's body is its main section, mostly made of metal and plastic. A written work's body
is the major part of a text, generally not including things like introductions or epilogues. In
science, a body is simply any separate object that has mass. The Old English root, bodig, means man
or animal's trunk or chest.
