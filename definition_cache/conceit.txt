If you’re always boasting and can’t stop talking about yourself, you have that character flaw
known as conceit. Your friends — if you have any — may also complain about your arrogance,
vanity, and egotism.

A conceit can also be an artistic device — probably a little forced — like the plot of a movie
built on the conceit of everything that happens being foretold in song. You might find an
architectural conceit in a Baroque palace, where you think you’re looking down a long hallway
lined with columns, but when you get closer you see that it's really a mural painted in perspective
so that the columns only seem to disappear in the distance.
