A parody is a humorous or mocking imitation of something, using the same form as the original. To
parody a poem, you have to write another poem.

A parody is a form of humor that spoofs â&euro;&rdquo; or satirizes â&euro;&rdquo; something using
the same form. For example, shows like Saturday Night Live and The Daily Show have parodied real
newscasts by doing fake newscasts that look like the real thing. Whoever is President always gets
parodied by various comedians and comedy writers. Anything in the public eye could be the victim of
a parody.
