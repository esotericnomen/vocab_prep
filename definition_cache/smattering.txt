A smattering is a small but inexact amount of something. If you know a smattering of things about
Australia, then you don't know much.

A smattering is a small amount of something, but it's hard to say how much. It's probably less than
a bunch, but it's not much more than a whit or a jot. If you said There's a smattering of squirrels
in the park, then there are only a few squirrels. This word also implies that you don't understand a
subject very well Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; a smattering of knowledge is only a tiny bit of knowledge.
