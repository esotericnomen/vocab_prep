Ethereal is something airy and insubstantial, such as a ghostly figure at the top of the stairs. It
might also be something delicate and light, like a translucent fabric, or a singer’s delicate
voice.

Ethereal comes from the Greek word for ether, which is a drug that makes you feel light headed and,
in larger doses, causes you to lose consciousness. An ethereal substance or sound is one that
carries the feeling of ether––something you might see in a vision, that might strike you as
heavenly or supernatural.
