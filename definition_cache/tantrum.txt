A tantrum is a short-lived fit of frustration. Kids have them. Politicians have them. Reality show
stars have them. I bet even you have had one!

To understand what tantrum means, stake out a supermarket and observe parents with toddlers. Soon,
you will see a small child, incapable of expressing the complexities of why he or she really needs a
lollipop, erupt into a full-blown tantrum. When people explode into tantrums, they no longer seem
able to control their impulses. (I canâ&euro;&trade;t have that lollipop or that place on the
island? Well, Iâ&euro;&trade;m going to FREAK OUT!) Even the most mature of us are susceptible to
tantrums when we are tired, hungry or discouraged.
