Use the adjective transient to describe something that always changes or moves around, like how a
teenage girl can have a temporary crush on one boy one week and another boy the next week.

Transient is most often used to modify nouns like nature, threat, source and cause, which suggests
that the word  often shows up in  formal contexts, such as analysis of finance or global terrorism.
But it can also be used for anything that moves quickly from one thing to another, like a transient
feeling or facial expression. Transient is also a noun meaning a person who moves from place to
place; a homeless person. The word comes from Latin transire, to pass over, so you can think of it
as describing things that are quickly passed over.
