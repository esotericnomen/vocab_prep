When people are red-cheeked with good health they are florid. Spending most of the year in the
college library can give you a colorless, weary face, but after a mountain vacation, you'll be
florid with the reddish color that comes from exercise and living well.

Florid is an adjective that entered English in the 17th century, via the French floride, from the
Latin flÄ¹?ridus, blooming. You can probably guess how Florida and flourish are related! Something
overly decorated, such as a really ornate living room, is florid in the flowery sense, while people
with rosy cheeks and a look of healthiness are florid because they are flourishing with a fullness
of life. Your florid complexion matched your florid red drapes as you came in from the cold and
plunked down on the couch near the window.
