A tenet is a principle or belief honored by a person or, more often, a group of people. Seek
pleasure and avoid pain is a basic tenet of Hedonism. God exists is a tenet of most major religions.

Tenet is pronounced ten'it. The word evolved from the Latin tenere to hold. The noun tenet is an
opinion or doctrine one holds. It usually refers to a philosophy or a religion, but it doesn't have
to -- for instance, Eastern medicine has different tenets from Western medicine. One of the central
tenets of succeeding in the workplace is that a good offense is the best defense.
