If you know someone who's totally addicted to luxurious things and all of life's pleasures, call
them a sybarite. Unless she's inviting you over for champagne brunches and showering you with gifts
— in which case you should keep your mouth shut.

Sybarite was first recorded in the 1600s, meaning a “person devoted to pleasure.” The literal
translation of this noun is “inhabitant of Sybaris,” which was an ancient Greek town full of
citizens who loved nice things. Today, the word still has the same two meanings: it's either a
person who could be described as addicted to pleasures and luxury (like a hedonist), or an actual
person who lives in Sybaris.
