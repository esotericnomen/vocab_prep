Do you consider yourself a moral person, who tries to do good and be good? If the answer is yes, you
are righteous â€” in the right.

Being righteous literally means to be right, especially in a moral way. Religious people often talk
about being righteous. In their view, the righteous person not only does the right thing for other
people but also follows the laws of their religion. Heroes like Martin Luther King are often called
righteous. On the other hand, this word can be a little negative. If you call someone self-
righteous, it means they're a little too sure they're right and better than other people.
