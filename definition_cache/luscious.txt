Calling something luscious means it's juicy, delicious and otherwise incredibly pleasing to the
senses. That goes for good looking people as well as a fine piece of chocolate cake.

An adjective meaning richly appealing or scrumptious, luscious is actually believed to be a
shortened version of delicious. Synonyms include succulent, savory and enticing Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; all
words that can also be used to either describe a perfectly cooked steak or your crush's
unbelievable, irresistible lips.
