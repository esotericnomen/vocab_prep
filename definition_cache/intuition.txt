If you know the definition of this noun by quick insight without relying on reason, you know what
intuition means!

Intuition is a noun whose definition means that someone uses quick understanding to interpret but
without using reasoning or perception, a snap judgment. The definition of the word comes from the
Latin roots in- meaning at or on and tueri meaning look at, watch over. A relative of intuition is
tuition, and even though we don't use this particular meaning anymore, it used to refer to having
guardianship or custody. If we use our intuition it means that we don't always make the correct
interpretation, and in fact, the Australian writer Christina Stead wrote, Intuition is not
infallible; it only seems to be the truth.
