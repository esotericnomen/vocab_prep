Doom is death, destruction, the end of the world, the big goodbye. It can also be a verb — if a
man twirling a mustache ties you to the railroad tracks, he dooms you to certain death!

Doctor Doom is a comic book villain you do not want to mess with. He’s the doctor of death! If you
feel that the world is terrible, you’re all doom and gloom. If someone dies, she meets her doom.
People usually talk about doom as a type of fate — doom isn't an accident. When doom is a verb,
watch out — being slack dooms careers and lies doom relationships. Stay away from all forms of
doom.
