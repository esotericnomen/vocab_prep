Gall describes something irritating, like someone very rude. If you barge into a bakery and cut in
front of a sweet old lady, then you have gall.

If someone has gall, they're irritating. In fact, as a verb, gall means to irritate like new tight
jeans that gall your thighs. Gall is bile, too,  like what's in a gall bladder. Back in the days of
Hippocrates, if the four humors of the body were out of whack, it affected your spirits. If you had
too much bile, or gall, then you'd be aggressive or depressed. It's also a noun for deep feeling of
ill will.
