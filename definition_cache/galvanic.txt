You can use the adjective galvanic to describe electricity that's formed from a chemical reaction.

A galvanic current, or one that develops from two or more substances reacting chemically to each
other, is often considered to be harmful, causing corrosion of metal in some cases. A deliberate
galvanic reaction happens in a battery, however, as its electricity is produced from a chemical
reaction. The word galvanic comes from the name of the Italian scientist who first identified this
kind of electricity, Luigi Galvani.
