Things that are healthful are good for your body, mind, or overall well-being. Your dinner of
barbecued potato chips, ice cream, and slices of cheddar cheese might be delicious, but it's not
very healthful.

Something that has a favorable effect on your health can be described with the adjective healthful.
Well-balanced meals full of whole grains and vegetables are healthful. A good night's sleep and a
long walk in the fresh air are both healthful, because they promote your good health. When you are
full of health, however, don't use healthful to describe yourself Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; instead, use the
closely related word healthy.
