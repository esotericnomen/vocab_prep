A paltry amount is so small it's not even worth thinking about. In the novel Oliver Twist, when
Oliver is given a paltry amount of gruel — not nearly enough — he asks, Please, sir, can I have
some more?

Paltry is a laughably small amount — the waiter might chuck a paltry tip in the garbage. If you
have only 50 cents in your bank account, it's such a paltry amount, you may as well be broke. It can
also mean not worth considering or not important. If you keep breaking your promises, your friends
will get sick of your paltry excuses.
