A colloquy is a formal talk, the opposite of a chat, such as the colloquy you have with your boss
about a serious matter â€” far different from how you'll talk to your friends about it afterward.

To correctly pronounce colloquy, accent the first syllable: KOLL uh kwee. The word comes from the
Latin prefix com-, meaning together, and loquium, meaning speaking. That adds up to speaking
together. You probably recognize loqui, meaning to speak, in words like locution and colloquial,
which also involve speaking.
