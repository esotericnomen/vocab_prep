A newly planted apple tree can take years to fructify, but when it does there will be plenty of
apples to go around. To fructify is to “produce fruit,” or “become fruitful.”

Fructify means “to bear fruit,” as in “Soon the orange grove will fructify and we will harvest
the oranges.” Fructify can also refer to a seed that grows or fructifies into a healthy plant.
More generally, though, the verb fructify means either “to make productive” or “to become
productive.”  Investing money can fructify medical research, which will in turn fructify with new
cures and treatments.  You could say that a company will fructify, or become fruitful, if everyone
works together.
