The verb stymie means to obstruct or hinder. Constantly texting with your friends will stymie your
effort to finish your homework.

Stymie was first used on the golf course in Scotland, where it referred to an opponent's ball
blocking your own ballâ&euro;&trade;s path to the cup. From there a verb sense developed, until
finally stymie came to mean blocking with any obstacle, not just a golf ball.
