A bromide is a common saying or proverb that is obvious and not that helpful, like When life hands
you lemons, make lemonade.

Some people love to say things like Follow your dreams and Love takes hard work. Such trite,
clichĂŠd sayings are bromides. A bromide isn't very helpful or specific, and people tend to say
them over and over again. The word bromide comes from the chemical compound made of the element
bromine and another metal. This kind of bromide was historically used as a sedative, a medicine that
dulls your senses, just as figurative bromides are boring and dull.
