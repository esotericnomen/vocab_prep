If you are writing a report on climate change, and ignore evidence that the earth is warming, the
paper might be called tendentious. Tendentious means promoting a specific, and controversial, point
of view.

When something is tendentious, it shows a bias towards a particular point of view, especially one
that people disagree about. It shares a root with the word, tendency, which means leaning towards
acting a certain way. If you have the tendency to talk in a tendentious manner about politics,
people might tend to avoid you at parties.
