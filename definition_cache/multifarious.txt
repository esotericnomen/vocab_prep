A person or thing with many sides or different qualities is multifarious. The Internet has
multifarious uses, museums are known for their multifarious art collections, and Hindu gods are
associated with multifarious incarnations.

You can use the adjective multifarious to describe anything that has a lot of sides or aspects, and
the 16th-century roots of the word come from multi-, or many, parts or expressions. Comic actors who
can morph their faces into a 1000 different looks are multifarious, and parents who can run
businesses, coach soccer leagues, and tell good stories are pretty multifarious too.
