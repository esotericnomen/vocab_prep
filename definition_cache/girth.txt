The girth  of something is the distance around its middle, and it usually refers to a person’s
waist. If you get pregnant with twins, your girth will probably block your view of your toes.

One can measure the girth — diameter of the mid-section — of an airplane, tree trunk, or
anything cylindrical, but it most often describes a large human waist. A rail-thin person doesn’t
have a “minuscule girth,” but when Aunt Velma has her seventh helping of lasagna and has to
unbuckle her belt, her girth has outsized her attire. Girth can also mean a strap that encircles the
belly of a horse, mule, or other animal to secure a load.
