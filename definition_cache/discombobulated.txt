Walking through the door to your house only to find out all your friends have gathered to throw you
a surprise party can leave you feeling happy though somewhat discombobulated. If something
discombobulates you, it confuses and slightly pains you.

This early 19th century word was first used in America, and it had a few different spellings before
it became standardized. The source or origin is not known for certain. It may have been formed by
alteration of discompose, discomfit, or discomfort, all words with a very similar meaning. Or it may
be a blend of all three words.
