A musky smell might make you close your eyes and smile, or it might make you leave a room. Either
way, it’s a very strong and sweet odor that's hard to ignore.

Musk is a scent that deer secrete to convince a mate to cuddle with them, and so a musky odor often
does the same for humans. But not always! A woman wearing musky perfume might inspire you to ask her
on a date, but sometimes rotting fruit smells musky as well. Hard to know whether smelling musky is
a good or bad thing. If you can’t decide, just go scent-free.
