Don’t even think about making pancakes if you don’t have a spatula. What else would you flip
them with?

There are two main types of spatulas, both of which are kitchen utensils. One has a wide, flat
surface attached to the end of a handle and is ideal for picking up, flipping, or serving hot foods
like pancakes and hamburgers. The other has a more flexible end, usually made of rubber or plastic,
and is used for mixing batter or spreading icing. Painters also use a type of spatula to mix or
spread paint.
