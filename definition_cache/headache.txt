A headache is a pain or ache in your head, especially one that lasts longer than a few minutes. You
might get a headache after a day of staring at a computer screen.

There are many reasons for getting a headache, from staying up too late to a stressful day to
skipping your morning cup of coffee. A more serious type of headache, like a migraine, might keep
you home from work for a day, but most headaches are just a nuisance. You can also describe a
problem or struggle as a figurative headache: Learning Danish is turning out to be a real headache.
In Old English, the word was heafodece.
