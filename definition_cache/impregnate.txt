Use the verb impregnate to describe what happens when a male of any animal species makes a female
pregnant. Human fathers impregnate mothers â€” otherwise, they would not become fathers.

When dog breeders mate two German shepherds, they hope that the male will impregnate the female, or
make her pregnant. When your cat has kittens, it's because the neighbor's cat impregnated her
several months earlier. The Latin root, impraegnare, comes from in, into, and praegnare, pregnant.
