A clause can be a scary thing. Whether it is a stipulation in a contract or a grammatical concept,
people sometimes avoid clauses because they are too difficult to grasp.

A provision or stipulation in a contract, clause is a noun that comes to us from the old French
clause, which, if we trace it way back, comes from the Latin clausula “the end, a closing
termination.” Circa 1300, the “ending” implication of the word began to fade and was replaced
by “article or section of a text.” Legal documents, like prenuptial agreements or job contracts,
often contain a clause, or many.
