A patriot is someone who loves and who has sometimes fought for his or her country. “Nathan Hale
was a true patriot; his only regret was that he had but one life to give for his country.”

The word patriot comes from patrios (Greek, not Latin for once), which means of one’s father. So,
despite various references to the motherland, the word patriot more or less lands us square in the
fatherland arena. And if you’re a football fan, the New England Patriots is a near-Boston-based
team (Boston being a major source of American patriots in the Revolutionary War). And, if you want
to get yourself in trouble, you can wander Boston with a megaphone chanting, “The Patriots
stink.”
