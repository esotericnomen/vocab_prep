Render is a synonym of make––technically it means cause to become. An illness might render you
unable to walk, or a shocking site might render you speechless.

Another basic meaning of the verb render is to give, present, or perform something: to render
assistance. And a specialized sense is to formally declare a verdict in a court case. Render is from
Middle English, from Old French rendre to give back, deliver, an alteration of Latin reddere to
restore, from the prefix red-, re- back plus dare to give.
