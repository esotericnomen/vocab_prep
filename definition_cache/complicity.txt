Complicity is involvement in a wrongful act â€” like when you drove your newly-turned-vegetarian
friend to a fast food joint so that she could scarf down a hamburger.

Complicity refers to the act of helping someone else behave inappropriately or illegally. If you
find yourself accused of complicity, it's often helpful to show that you were unaware of the other
person's intentions. In the case of the trip to the fast food restaurant, that's going to be hard to
prove. You'll probably be scorned for being an accomplice, or someone who is complicit, in your
friend's shameful act.
