A chalice is a bowl-shaped drinking vessel. Chalices were all the rage back in King Arthur's day.

You won't come across the word chalice very often today (outside of books, anyway) unless you hang
out at those Renaissance fairs where everyone dresses up as knights. The term poisoned chalice is
good for describing something that looks beneficial, but is actually harmful.
