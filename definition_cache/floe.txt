An ice floe is a large, free-floating, flat chunk of ice floating in the ocean. Beware: if you're at
the North Pole, you could get stranded on an ice floe along with polar bears and other arctic
creatures.

A floe can vary in size from small to giant, but they differ from icebergs in their relative lack of
depth. When you spot an iceberg, itâ&euro;&trade;s often just the tip of whatâ&euro;&trade;s
there, but with a floe, what you see is what you get. The floe edge is where the ice that is still
attached to the land, having frozen over the winter months, meets the sea. When the floe edge
fractures, the ice floe floats out to sea.
