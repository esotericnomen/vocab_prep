Though a galleon was a large ship with multiple decks, it was no cruise liner and probably didn’t
offer round-the-clock buffets.

A galleon refers to a type of sailboat used in the 15th to 18th centuries mostly for battles and
carrying consumer goods. Galleons had big square sails rigged onto several masts. They were built
and sailed by many Europeans, but they are most commonly associated with the Spanish. In fact, this
word is derived from the Spanish word galeón, which means “armed merchant ship.”
