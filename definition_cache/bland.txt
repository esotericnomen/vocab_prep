When you have a nasty cold and you’re very congested, food can taste unappealingly bland. That
means dull, flavorless, or just plain “blah.”

Bland comes to us from the Latin word blandus, meaning “mild, smooth, flattering, alluring.”
Funny, because today you wouldn't say there's anything alluring about something bland. People still
use bland to mean pleasant and tranquil, but it more often has a negative connotation. Use it to
describe plain old oatmeal before you’ve added brown sugar and berries to it, or to depict the
forgettable, uninteresting personality of the lunch lady who served it to you.
