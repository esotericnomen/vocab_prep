Raconteurs are gifted storytellers, able to spin amusing tales from everyday life. Who is the
biggest raconteur in your group? He or she's the one who always tells the best stories — or jumps
in when another storyteller isn't being vivid enough.

Do you make going to the store to buy groceries a fascinating experience? Do you offer witty
observations of the people you pass on the street? If so, you're a raconteur, someone who can regale
his or her listeners with riveting stories, usually funny, sometimes dramatic. Raconteur comes from
the French word raconter,  meaning to recount.  Note its eur ending, signaling its French origin.
