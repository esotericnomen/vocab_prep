If you can't decide which of three songs to play, why not play a medley? A medley is one piece of
music, made up of passages from other songs.

Medley comes from the Old French word medlee which meant â&euro;&rdquo; eek! â&euro;&rdquo; hand-
to-hand combat. There are times, like when watching the Academy Awards, that a really long medley
accompanied by, say, mimes, might make you want to engage in battle, but a better way to remember
this word is that it is related to the word, meddle, which means to get mixed up in someone's
business.
