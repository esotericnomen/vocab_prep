Whether you are eating a steak, playing table tennis, or cheering on your favorite team, you can use
the word gusto to describe something you do with great enthusiasm.

Since the seventeenth century the word gusto has been helping English speakers describe things that
are done with vigor and enthusiasm. The word came into English from the Italian word gusto, which
means “taste,” and its Italian origins are evident both in its spelling — the “o” ending
is a clue — and in its sense of “a taste for life. Use this word to describe vigorous activities
— you probably wouldn’t, say, take a nap with gusto, even if you really enjoy napping. You are
more likely to score goals and dance the Macarena with gusto.
