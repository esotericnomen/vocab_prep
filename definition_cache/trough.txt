If you live on a farm, you already know that a trough is what animals eat out of. The word actually
refers to the shape of the container, and can mean anything that is low and hollowed out––a math
curve, a depression in the ground.

In the olden days, people, like animals, ate from troughs. Gradually, we got fancy enough to divide
our food between bowls and plates, but there is some lingering connection between the idea of trough
and rough, peasant living.
