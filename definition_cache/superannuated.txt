If a friend describes your dot matrix printer as superannuated, then you should probably plan a
shopping trip for electronics. Your friend has just pointed out that your printer is obsolete.

The word superannuated, pronounced su-per-AN-you-ay-ted, comes from the Medieval Latin word
superannuatus, which means “to be too old.” You can use this word to describe things that are
obsolete because of age, like a superannuated car you can't fix because replacement parts are no
longer made. You also might be tempted to call the word superannuated, well, superannuated, because
you don’t hear it used very much anymore.
