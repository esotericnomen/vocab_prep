Someone or something that is prolific is fruitful or highly productive. A prolific songwriter can
churn out five hit tunes before breakfast.

It is interesting to note that many of the words used to describe the adjective prolific are relayed
in biological terms, such as to give birth, nourish, and fertile. Other uses of the word pertain to
having many ideas or an active and expressive mind, such as a prolific writer. Clearly, people like
to consider that the ideas or things that they make are in some way produced by them like flowers or
fruit!
