An ideology is a set of opinions or beliefs of a group or an individual. Very often ideology refers
to a set of political beliefs or a set of ideas that characterize a particular culture.

Capitalism, communism, socialism, and Marxism are ideologies. But not all -ism words are. Think:
cronyism (a system of graft whereby friends unfairly help each other make money.) Our English noun
is from French idĂŠologie. The suffix â&euro;&ldquo;logy, used with many English words describing
theories or doctrines, is from Greek logos word, reason, speech, account.
