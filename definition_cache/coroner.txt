A coroner is a scientist with a grim specialty: a coroner studies dead bodies and figures out the
cause of death.

If you've ever watched a TV show or movie about crime, chances are you've seen a character who was a
coroner. If someone dies of a heart attack, there's not much need for a coroner, because everyone
knows how they died. When the circumstances are unclear or suspicious, a coroner is needed. Coroners
are very helpful in solving crimes.
