To enervate is to weaken, wear down, or even bum out. A three-hour lecture on the history of socks
might thrill someone, it would enervate most people. So would a too-long soak in a hot tub. With
your parents.

Trace enervate back far enough and find it comes from the Latin enervare which means to basically
“to cut the sinew” or “to cause to be cut from the muscle.” That would certainly weaken
someone. These days, there’s no need for violence. To enervate someone is to sap their energy,
like by reading your ex all the love letters your new sweetheart wrote you. When something enervates
you, it does more than get on your nerves; it brings you down.
