Now here's a word, archipelago, that is super-specific: it means a group of many islands. Wouldn't
it be great to build your dream house in the Galapagos archipelago?

It seems that archipelago came from the Italian Arciplago, the name for the Aegean Sea, which is
full of many many islands. Somehow that became the word for any sea that is chock-full of islands.
You can also use archipelago to indicate some other grouping that involves neither islands nor water
but is similar to them. Your little sister might create an archipelago of Lego buildings on your
living room carpet.
