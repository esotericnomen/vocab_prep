When you have a misapprehension, you make a mistake trying to understand something, which leads you
to believe something that isn't true. You may have a misapprehension about your brother's motives
for being so nice to you this week.

You may have an uncle who is famous for his misapprehension of luck and probability, which must be
why he’s lost so much money gambling. He also has a misapprehension of geography, so he thinks he
can get from his house in Maryland to your house in New Hampshire in under four hours — by bus! No
one ever said your uncle was stupid — he just has a misapprehension of some basic things that the
rest of the family gets.
