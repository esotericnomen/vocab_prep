The dissolution of a relationship means that it's broken up or ended. The dissolution of your band
means you better get started on your solo album.

Dissolution comes from the Latin word dissolutio, meaning a dissolving of something. Dissolution
looks very similar to dissolve, so to help you remember the meaning, think about what happens if you
put paper in water Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; it breaks apart. A dissolution of a marriage is the same thing as
divorce. Although it sounds like disillusion, if you try to use them interchangeably, your logic
will fall apart.
