To breed is to have babies, whether you’re a human or a hermit crab. A breed is also a specific
type of a domesticated species, like a poodle or Great Dane.

The word breed comes from the Old English bredan which means to bring young to birth, but also
cherish,” which is how most people feel about their offspring. Awwwww. But the fact is that
breeding is reproducing. Also, a breed is a strain or stock of a species, such as a Siamese cat.
There are many types of dog breeds, cow breeds, and even pig breeds. Members of a breed usually look
and behave in a similar way.
