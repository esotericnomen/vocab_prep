In a tough economy, you see a lot of consolidation. This could be smaller businesses joining
together or the consolidation of debt, as in combining three credit card payments into one. Anywhere
there’s consolidation , there’s merging, joining, and combining.

You can see the word solid  at the heart of consolidation, and its Latin roots will tell you that it
means “to make solid together.” The goal of consolidation is really just that, to combine things
in order to make them stronger or more beneficial. If you’re good at art and your friend is good
at science, you may want to form a consolidation to take the science fair by storm.
