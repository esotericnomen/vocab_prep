Ruddy is used to describe something that is reddish â€” like the color of red hair, tomatoes, or
your cheeks on a cold winter's day.

Ruddy is commonly used to describe someone's complexion. In this case, it describes a healthy,
reddish glow. Your skin might have a ruddy tone from working outside. You may hear someone use ruddy
as a negative adjective, as well. In Britain it is a substitute for words like bloody or darn: The
ruddy door is stuck again. I'm going to take an axe to it!
