Raiment is an old-fashioned word for clothing, particularly fancy clothing, like ladies who always
wore their best raiment when calling on friends.

Raiment is formal clothing. It comes from the Old French word areer or to array, which describes
dressing in decorative clothing, or adorning yourself in the very best. The word raiment has mostly
gone out of use, much like the rare practice of getting very dressed up.
