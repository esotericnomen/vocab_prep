If you contract something highly infectious, such as pinkeye, please quarantine yourself so that you
don’t infect others with it. This means you’ll have to stay in isolation and avoid contact with
other people.

Starting in the 16th century, a quarantine lasted specifically 40 days. The word is in fact derived
from the Latin quadraginta, which means forty. Originally, this referred to the amount of time a
widow could remain in her deceased husband’s house, then referred to the period of time a ship had
to wait off a country’s port if its passengers were disease-stricken. Now, it can mean a period of
isolation of any length, and can be used as both a verb and a noun.
