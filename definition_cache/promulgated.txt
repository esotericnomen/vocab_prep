Promulgated means published, or formally and publicly declared. Newspaper opinion pieces contain
promulgated ideas and viewpoints.

Promulgated comes from the Latin word promulgare, which means to make publicly known. Promulgated
laws are ones that are announced by some kind of formal proclamation. But these days you'll more
often hear about promulgated ideas -- it's a fancier way of saying they're promoted or shared with a
lot of other people. So those thoughts you post to your blog? They're all promulgated opinions.
