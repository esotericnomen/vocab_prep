Husbandry has nothing to do with being a husband, and a lot to do with being a farmer. If you
cultivate the land or breed animals, you are practicing husbandry.

Long before husbands were hen-pecked guys who cut the grass on weekends and played with the kiddies
after school, they were robust men of the Earth â&euro;&rdquo; farmers, in other words. That
meaning died out, but its current meaning survives as a remnant of it. Today, you most often hear of
crop husbandry, which refers to raising crops; however, if you practice toad husbandry
â&euro;&rdquo; you must be raising toads.
