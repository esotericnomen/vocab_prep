Happy is a feeling of joy, pleasure, or good fortune â€” exactly how you'd feel if you learned that
you won the lottery or got accepted into your number one choice of colleges.

Happy hails from the Middle English word hap, meaning good luck. Many of the early European words
for happy actually referred to good luck, rather than a feeling of joy. On its own, happy means an
enjoyable or satisfied state of being. When hyphenated, it can refer to an overwhelming inclination
to do something. Someone who is trigger-happy, for example, has an overwhelming urge to shoot
things, while a clothes-happy person is obsessed with taking trips to the mall.
