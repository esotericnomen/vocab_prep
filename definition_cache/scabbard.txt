A scabbard is a sheath for a sword, dagger, or other type of knife. Some cooks wear their French
knives in a scabbard so they'll be ready to chop no matter where they are in the kitchen.

You√¢&euro;&trade;ve probably seen a scabbard in an older movie. The hero sheaths his sword in a
long wooden, metal or leather scabbard hanging from his belt. The origins of the word, however, are
not that manly. Scabbard comes from an old Germanic compound meaning blade protector.
