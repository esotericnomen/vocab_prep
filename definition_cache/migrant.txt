A migrant worker is someone who travels for a job––in the U.S., many farm workers migrate from
Mexico every year to work on the harvest and then return home when their jobs are over.

If you have traveled into a new country, you are said to have immigrated there, and you are an
immigrant. An emigrant is someone who has left. Migrant doesn't refer to whether you are coming in
or out––often it means someone who often travels back and forth, like migrant birds who migrate
south every winter, year after year.
