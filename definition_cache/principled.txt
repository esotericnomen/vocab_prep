If you decide to take a lower grade rather than cheat on a test, you are making a principled
decision, or one that is based on moral rightness.

Most people have a set of principles or basic moral rules that they follow. These might include not
stealing, not cheating, and treating people as you would like to be treated. Decisions made
following these rules are principled, as are people who follow their principles often. If you take a
principled stance on censorship, your defend or refute it actively based on your convictions.
