Since the meaning of opportune is favorable or well-timed, it's easy to guess that the meaning of
inopportune means something that is ill-timed or inappropriate. That little prefix in- means not,
and it totally turns the meaning of a word around.

Think of the Latin word opportunus, which means fitting or opportune. When you add in- in front of
it, or any word, you give the word the opposite meaning. That's the history of the word inopportune,
which has been used since the early 16th century to describe something that is not fitting. For
example, She opened the door at an inopportune moment and saw him fire the gun. Bad timing? You bet.
And very inopportune.
