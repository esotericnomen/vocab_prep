You are probably most familiar with the word capillary as a minute vessel that transports blood to
larger vessels in the body, but a capillary can actually mean any tiny tubelike device that moves a
liquid from point to point.

Capillary comes from the Latin word capillaris, meaning of or resembling hair. The meaning stems
from the tiny, hairlike diameter of a capillary. While capillary is usually used as a noun, the word
also is used as an adjective, as in capillary action, in which a liquid is moved along
â&euro;&rdquo; even upward, against gravity â&euro;&rdquo; as the liquid is attracted to the
internal surface of the capillaries.
