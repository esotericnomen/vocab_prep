Clearly, you're interested in the nicety of a word's meaning if you're checking out this website. A
nicety is a fine detail or shade of meaning that anything — not just a word — can possess.

Even the word nicety has niceties. The emphasis on detail can also refer to a precision or accuracy
of sorts; if someone has judged something to a nicety, they've judged it exactly. Yet another common
meaning is in the sense of a minor aspect of polite behavior. Washing your hands before dinner is a
social nicety. So is covering your mouth when you cough. Now where would we be without niceties?
