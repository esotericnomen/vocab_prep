An interim is a period of time between one event and another, maybe the interim between the arrival
of your party guests and the cleanup you have to do after they leave.

If you use this word, you will be speaking Latin, since interim is a Latin adverb meaning in the
meantime. The first part, inter, is also Latin, and means between. Knowing this, you can figure out
a lot of words. Some of your party guests will interact well, and some will argue. If your principal
leaves the school, you might have an interim principalâ&euro;&ldquo;â&euro;&ldquo;someone who
keeps the school running while a new principal is interviewed and hired.
