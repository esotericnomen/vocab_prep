A rejoinder usually means a witty comeback. If someone asks you a silly question like, Are you
painting? when you are holding a paint can and a brush, your rejoinder could be, No, I'm just doing
my nails.

The word rejoinder comes from the Middle French word rejoindre, which meant to answer a legal
charge. The meaning of a witty retort developed from the legal meaning. You often think of the best
rejoinders long after the crucial moments have passed, which can be really frustrating.
