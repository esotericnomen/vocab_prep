When you give someone a good, long look, you regard them. It can also mean to believe, as in, I
regard her as my best friend.

Regard often means respect and admiration, as in I have the greatest regard for my grandmother.
Sometimes it's a greeting: you can send someone your regards, which means to tell them you said
hello and wish them well. There's a famous song called, Give My Regards to Broadway. On the other
hand, you can use it as a sign-off on a letter. Instead of Sincerely or Yours Truly, you can close
with Regards.
