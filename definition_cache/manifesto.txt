A manifesto is a public statement stating your views or your intention to do something. If you feel
you should be voted Most Likely to Succeed, you could issue a manifesto describing all the reasons
why you deserve to win.

Manifesto comes from the Italian word of the same spelling, meaning public declaration explaining
past actions and announcing the motive for forthcoming ones. You'll most often hear about a
manifesto that's been issued by a group, like a political party or government Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; for
example, a set of new rules that an incoming regime is going to enforce. Though organizations are
more likely to create a manifesto, it's also possible for an individual to issue one about more
personal ideas.
