Charity is the donation of something, like money, to a cause or person in need. Before offering
charity to someone, make sure he is, in fact, needy, and not just some fashion fiend dressed like a
homeless person!

Charity comes in many forms including monetary donation, volunteering, or providing clothes and food
for those less fortunate. The Greek poet Homer said, â&euro;&oelig;The charity that is a trifle to
us can be precious to others.â&euro;? Think of charity, then, as something that may cost you a
little, but can benefit someone else greatly. Charity also refers to a nice way to treat people, an
organization that helps people, or a plant with blue and white flowers.
