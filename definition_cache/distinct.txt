When something is distinct, it is easily identifiable or set apart from others of its kind.  An
eighth-grader who is six feet tall has a distinct advantage over the other kids on the basketball
court.

A thing can be distinct if it is easy to see, either because it is different in some way from the
things around it or if it is more clear and visible, as in: “The license number of the getaway car
was more distinct once I cleaned my glasses.”  The word distinct comes from “to distinguish,”
which is when a person or thing is set apart from the pack: “The research that she did was
distinct in its attention to detail.”
