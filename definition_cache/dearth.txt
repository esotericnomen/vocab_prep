If there is a dearth of something, there is not enough of it. A dearth of affordable housing is bad,
but a dearth of bed bugs is a blessing.

Dearth is an Old English noun formed from the adjective deore precious, costly and the noun-forming
suffix -th. Though the relationship of dearth meaning lack, insufficient amount to the adjective
dear is not so obvious, it is still easy to imagine that something precious is probably also in
short supply. Dearth is used almost exclusively in the phrase a dearth of.
