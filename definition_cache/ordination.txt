What an inauguration is to a president, an ordination is to a religious authority. It's the ceremony
of bestowing a person with a position of religious authority — as when someone becomes a priest,
minister, or shaman.

The noun ordination comes from the Latin word ordinare, meaning “put in order.” Becoming a
religious leader usually requires training in a seminary followed by an ordination. On the other
hand, the ordination of a monarch is a ceremony in which a King’s or Queen’s divine right to
rule the country, which was historically considered a birth right, is asserted and initiated without
any seminary courses required.
