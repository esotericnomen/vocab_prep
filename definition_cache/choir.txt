A choir is group of singers, often gathered for church ceremonies. If you love to sing but don't
fancy a solo turn on a TV talent show, perhaps joining a choir would satisfy you.

Choir, pronounced QUIRE, comes from the Latin word chorus, which itself comes from the Greek name
for a group of singers and dancers. We still use chorus for singing or dancing, but choir is
exclusively for singing groups. Although choirs are traditionally associated with church services,
they don't have to be. If you love singing but aren't religious, you could start a choir that sings
about the glory of donuts. It's also a verb, as in, I love to choir.
