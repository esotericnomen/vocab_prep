Despite many jokes to the contrary, a humanitarian is not someone who eats humans (as a vegetarian
eats vegetables)! A humanitarian is a person concerned with the welfare of all mankind.

A millionaire would be considered a great humanitarian if he donated much of his wealth for
improving education, housing, and food for the poor. As an adjective, humanitarian is used to
describe something or someone who displays the characteristics of someone concerned with human
welfare: The humanitarian project was developed to help women become self-sufficient in third world
countries.
