Although traditionally used to refer to the bloodsucking undead, you can use the noun vampire to
describe someone who heartlessly preys on others — a blackmailer, or anyone else who just sucks
the life out of you.

Vampire first appeared as a word in English in the early 1700’s, but folklore surrounding undead
creatures that feed off of human blood has been around since the earliest times. Among many supposed
abilities, vampires are sometimes believed to be able to take the form of a bat. The word vampire is
also used to refer to non-mythical “vampire bats” which are native to the Americas and really do
feed on blood.
