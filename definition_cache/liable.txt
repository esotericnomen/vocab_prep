If you drive into someone's fence, you’ll probably be held liable — legally responsible — for
fixing it. Liable can also mean “likely,” usually with something unpleasant: If you don't brush
your teeth, they're liable to fall out.

When liable refers to legal responsibility, it's used with for: You're liable for the court costs
(meaning you have to pay them). When liable means likely, it's with to: If you build your house on
that cliff, it's liable to fall into the river, or That part of town is liable to mudslides. Don't
confuse liable with libel, which is a legal term for slander, or saying something false and damaging
about someone.
