Skulking is cowardly. It means hiding out, either because you're trying to pull something off in
secret, or you're trying to get out of doing something you're supposed to be doing.

If you cut school, it makes sense to do it in the style of Ferris Bueller's Day Off, and enjoy
yourself. Will the punishment be worse than if you skulk around town, avoiding teachers and people
your parents know, not doing anything you really want to do? In spy movies, there are always bad
guys in hotel lobbies, skulking about, hiding behind open newspapers.
