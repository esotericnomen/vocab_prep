A man who is constantly checking out his outfit in the mirror might be foppish, or someone who loves
dressing up in fancy clothes.

For some reason, foppish is almost always used to describe men (not women), and that's why the word
might make you think of an elegant suit, vest, and tie, and probably some over-the-top details like
a flower in a buttonhole and a polka-dotted handkerchief. The word foppish also implies that this
guy probably thinks he looks pretty good.
