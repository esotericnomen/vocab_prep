A talisman is a charm that is supposed to ward off evil or illness. Your rabbit's foot key chain may
be your lucky talisman, but it wasn't so lucky for that rabbit, of course.

The word talisman has been around in English since the 1630s and it has roots in both Arabic and
Greek words. A talisman is usually worn around the neck but could exist in other forms, like a ring
or inscribed stone. You can think of a talisman as a good luck charm, but people tend to take
talismans more seriously Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; as if they are empowered with magic to ward off evil
spirits.
