If something is full of tiny holes or openings, you can describe it as porous. A sponge is porous,
and if the border between countries is open for anyone to cross easily, it too can be called porous.

You can see the word pore â&euro;&rdquo; meaning a tiny opening â&euro;&rdquo; in porous. When
potters make a mug, they use special glazes to seal the porous clay, which otherwise would absorb
the liquid you put in the mug. This meaning has expanded so porous can describe any barrier that
allows easy passage in and out, like the porous border between two countries that allows residents
to move easily between them.
