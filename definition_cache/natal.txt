Use the adjective natal to describe something that has to do with birth, like an adopted child's
natal family, or birth parents.

The word natal shows up a lot when doctors talk about birth and pregnancy, especially in pre-natal,
which describes what happens before a baby is born. You can also use natal for things that occur at
the same time as a birth, like the position of the stars on that day or the town in which a child is
born Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; her natal city. In the fourteenth century, natal meant pertaining to birthdays,
from the Latin word natus, to be born.
