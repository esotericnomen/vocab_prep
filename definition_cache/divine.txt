To err is human, to forgive divine means that everyone makes mistakes, but we should try to be like
god and forgive one another. Divine basically means relating to, coming from, or like God or a god.

Divine also has an old-fashioned and informal meaning of being very good or pleasing, as in She
looked absolutely divine in her blue and white gown. This is an adjective that goes back to Middle
English, borrowed from Old French devine, from Latin d朝v朝nus divine, foreseeing, from d朝vus
god.
