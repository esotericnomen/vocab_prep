Of all the many nouns referring to a large group of things, one of the most fun is slew, as in I saw
a whole slew of birds in the tree by the river.

American English is constantly evolving, its richness coming from the many languages feeding into
it. The noun slew, for instance, is from the Irish Gaelic sluagh, meaning multitude. As an unrelated
verb, it's the past tense of slay.
