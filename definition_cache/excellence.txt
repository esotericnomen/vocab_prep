Excellence means greatness â€” the very best. Achieving excellence is never easy to do.

Excellence is a quality that people really appreciate, because it's so hard to find. Excellence is
the quality of excelling, of being truly the best at something. Getting an A+ shows excellence.
Michael Jordan's basketball career was filled with excellence. We love Picasso and Shakespeare for
their excellence. When you see excellence, you should appreciate the work that went into it. So much
in the world falls short of excellence.
