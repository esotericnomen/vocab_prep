The word lineage is used to describe everyone who descends from a particular ancestor. Mozart had
six children, but none of them had children of their own, so the composerâ€™s lineage ended after
one generation.

If you put an adjective like artistic or spiritual before lineage, it becomes clear you're talking
about people who are related by ideas or attitude, not by blood. There are many composers, even
today, who trace their musical lineage to Mozart, even though his actual lineage ended in the 19th
century.
