If you were born in the United States, probably the first doctor you ever laid eyes on was an
obstetrician, a medical doctor who delivers babies.

In many parts of the world, it’s more likely that a midwife would welcome you into the world. But
even though an obstetrician is a medical doctor and can be  male or female, the name goes back to
the Latin word for midwife, obstetrix, the woman who stands in front [of the woman having the baby].
Obstetricians are often called “O.B.,” for short, and an O.B. who also treats diseases of the
female reproductive system is called an “O.B.-G.Y.N.,” “obstetrician-gynecologist.”
