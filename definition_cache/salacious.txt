Something salacious is full of juicy details â€” but they're the kind of raunchy, lusty, dirty
details you probably don't want to hear.

Implying a certain kind of moral looseness, salacious is often used to describe nasty gossip,
obscene reports and steamy tales. Salacious things are usually not fit for general public
consumption and probably need some kind of parental guidance warning. Think of the tawdry accounts
of some politician's affair with a staffer, or a particularly sex-filled reality show on TV.
