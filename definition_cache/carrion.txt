The noun carrion refers to the dead and rotting flesh of an animal. Ever seen a dead opossum or cat
in the road? You can call that road kill carrion.

The word carrion comes from a Latin word caro, which means meat, but carrion is usually considered
unfit for human consumption. Birds of prey and other opportunistic animals will often have carrion
as part of their diet, however. Sometimes the word carrion is used a little more metaphorically: The
soldiers were unable to retrieve the bodies of their fallen brothers, so they were left on the field
of battle like so much carrion.
