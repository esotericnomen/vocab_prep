If someone wants to disburse funds to you, stick around â€” it means they're going to give you
money!

Disburse is a fancy, financial word that is just an official way of saying to pay or give out money.
Parents don't disburse allowance money, they give it, and if your friend owes you five bucks, he'll
pay you what he owes. On the other hand, lawyers disburse funds from a will. The government
disburses money for grants and federal projects. And if you get a mortgage, the bank disburses a
check to the seller of the house you bought.
