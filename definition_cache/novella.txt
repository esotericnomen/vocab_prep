Short novels are called novellas. If you don't want to write a novel, but have more to say than a
short story, you could try writing a novella.

You've surely heard of plays, poems, short stories, and novels. But novellas? They're not as well
known, but pretty simple: nothing more than short novels. Sometimes novellas are called novelettes,
but whatever you call them, you'll probably read a few in English class. Sometimes it's easier to
squeeze in a novella than a whole novel, so maybe you could start with Joseph Conrad's Heart of
Darkness or Franz Kafka's Metamorphosis.
