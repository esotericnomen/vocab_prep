Working class, blue collar, plebeian and certainly not aristocratic â€” that's what the adjective
proletarian means.

Proletarian has roots in the Latin word proles, which means offspring. That's because back in
ancient Rome, a proletarian was a member of the proletariat, the class of society that had no wealth
and didn't own property. The only thing these proletarians had to offer was their hard work and
their children. Today's proletarians are a little better off; they're considered the working class
and just might have better benefits through their unions than some white-collar workers out there.
