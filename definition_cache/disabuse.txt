Disabuse means to free someone of a belief that is not true. Many teachers of health find that when
they teach, they spend as much energy disabusing kids of false beliefs as they do giving them the
facts.

Disabuse is often connected to the word notion or idea. In singing lessons, you must disabuse young
singers of the idea that they can sing better by singing louder. In the first year of college, many
people are disabused of the idea that they way they are is normal, by meeting so many people who
represent other ways to be.
