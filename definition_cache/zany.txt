If you've been called zany, you are goofy, wacky, and clownish. Zany describes very silly people and
behaviors. If you break into a bad, old-guy imitation of hip-hop, you might be trying too hard to be
zany.

There's an old character in comedies from the 15th through the 19th centuries who always had the
Italian name Gianni, or Giovanni, another form of which was Zanni Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; from which we get
the adjective zany. Just as there are good clowns and kind of scary, weird clowns, zany describes
both truly funny and laughable people and things, as well as foolish, or ludicrous, attempts at
being funny. Something zany makes people laugh, unless it's weird zany and just makes them cringe.
