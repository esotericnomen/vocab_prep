To startle is to jump, like when you're surprised. If you’re sneaking through a dark room and step
on a sleeping dog’s tail — you might startle  the dog, and if she barks, that dog startles you
right back!

A startle is a quick, sharp movement, like a little jump that happens when you’re surprised or
suddenly scared. If you sneak up on your mom and say Boo! you’ll startle her and she might jump up
in her seat (before she yells at you to quit it). Alarm clocks and barking dogs often startle
people. The original meaning of startle, around 1300, was to run back and forth, from the Old
English word styrtan, to leap up.
