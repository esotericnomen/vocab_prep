Unless you're living in a cave cut off from humanity, you've seen these electronic machines with a
screen, keyboard, and brain that stores massive amounts of information. Computers are ubiquitous in
offices, airports, schools...even caves cut off from humanity.

Though computers are a thoroughly modern invention, the root word that gave them their name dates
all the way back to Roman times. Tech geeks dreamed up computer by embellishing the English word
compute, which means to calculate. Compute, in turn, comes from Latin com- with and putare to
reckon. So, your computer is a device that helps you reckon Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; or think. It also comes
in handy for email and every type of entertainment imaginable.
