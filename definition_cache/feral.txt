When animal control finds a feral dog, they have to handle it very carefully because the animal is
so wild that it's probably afraid of humans and likely to bite.

Feral is often used to describe a wild, untamed animal, like the feral cat with its claws and sharp
teeth menacingly bared, ready to strike. Qualities that are similar to a wild animal can also be
called feral. The child who grew alone up in a cabin in the woods, and who didn't go to school, was
called feral when she ran away from the orphanage.
