A helpful and considerate nature can be described as kind. It is kind of someone to volunteer to
rake their elderly neighbor's leaves in the fall. As a noun, kind refers to the variety or specific
type of something.

The adjective kind also describes showing sympathy or giving comfort. If someone's feelings are
hurt, a kind word can go a long way to making that person feel better. When kind means type, you
might talk about a kind of cake â&euro;&rdquo; chocolate or vanilla â&euro;&rdquo; or a kind of
person who likes to live alone. If you are kind of interested in something, you are only partially
interested in it.
