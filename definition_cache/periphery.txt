When something is on the periphery of your vision, you can only see it when you’re looking
sideways. Periphery means outside the boundary of something.

If you’re on the periphery of a group, you’re close to it but not part of it. A band on the
periphery of a particular scene might have opened for another band a few times, but it's never
headlined or gotten their big break. Periphery comes from a Greek word meaning to carry around.
