An aerie is the nest of a large bird of prey somewhere high up, such as the branch of a tree or a
clifftop.

Don't confuse aerie with airy, meaning spacious and well ventilated (though it's a safe bet that
given their location most aeries are exactly that). The word also has the meaning of a human
residence that's perched high up Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; particularly an artist's garret, for example, in
the eaves of a building.
