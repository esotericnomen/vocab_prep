If your energetic dog gets his paws on your beloved teddy bear, and you don’t realize it until
it’s too late, you might have to use a needle and thread to suture Teddy’s left arm back onto
his body.

Derived from the Latin sutura, which means “a sewing together,” the word suture can function as
both a verb and a noun. Teddy’s situation aside, this word almost always refers to stitches
performed on the human body. To suture is to stitch up a wound or incision. When used as a noun, it
can refer to either the thread used for the stitching or the seam that is created by this process.
