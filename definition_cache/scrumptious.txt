If you describe something as scrumptious,  you'd probably like to eat every last crumb.  Can I have
another slice of that scrumptious pie?  Please?

Something scrumptious is delightfully appetizing. We usually use it to talk about delicious food,
but if your little cousin is so cute you want to eat her up, then she's scrumptious too. Remember
that scrumptious has a p after the m, even though you often can't hear it when the word is spoken.
Another common mistake is to place -uous at the end of scrumptious rather than -ious.
