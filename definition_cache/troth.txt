A troth is a serious promise to be faithful, such as a pledge people make about getting married. If
you and your girlfriend announce your troth at a family dinner, then that means you better be
serious about your relationship.

You can pronounce troth to rhyme with cloth or to rhyme with oath. In fact, oath is a synonym for
troth. Both words are related to truth, in that when someone makes a troth or an oath, what is said
is taken as the truth. You can see troth in words like betrothal, which means engagement, or
betrothed, which refers to a person someone is engaged to.
