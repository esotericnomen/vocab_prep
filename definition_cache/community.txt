If a number of people consider themselves one group based on location, work, religion, nationality,
or even activity, they can be called a community. If you like to play online games, you are active
in the gamer community.

The original meaning of Latin communitatem a sense of fellowship shifted to mean a specific group of
people with a common interest during the Middle Ages. The modern English word community has both of
these meanings available. Street festivals or school fairs can help to develop a sense of community
in schools or neighborhoods. If you start a campaign to clean up the community, you want to make the
area you live in more attractive.
