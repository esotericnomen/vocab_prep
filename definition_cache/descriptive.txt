Descriptive language is vivid and specific, and helps someone imagine a scene he didn't witness. You
probably hope that your friend who works at the morgue isn't too descriptive when you ask him how
his day was.

The word descriptive comes from the Latin descript-, meaning written down. Something that is
descriptive uses an account of words to give us a sense of what it's like. We usually use
descriptive when people are very effective at conveying something. James Agee is an author who
excels at descriptive writing, spending pages and pages beautifully describing the scene of a poor
cabin in the moonlight.
