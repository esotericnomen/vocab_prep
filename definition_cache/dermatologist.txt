The person who examines your moles, acne, and other skin problems is called a dermatologist. Once
visited mainly for acne problems, dermatologists have become more important, as skin problems have
grown more common with our increased exposure to the sun.

You know that an -logy at the end of a word means study and that -logist means one who studies. In
the noun dermatologist, the object being studied is the derma, the Greek word for skin. (The Greeks
also used it to refer to leather or hide, which still works for diehard sun worshipers. And think of
elephants being called pachyderms, with their thick skin.) Dermatology and dermatologist both
appeared in English in the 19th century.
