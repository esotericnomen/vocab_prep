Something's color is its pigment. Technically, all living things have a natural pigment — leaves
have a green pigment for example — but the word is more generally applied to human skin color.

The other, more technical, use of pigment refers to the substance, usually a powder, that is added
to a liquid to give it its color. For example, ultramarine paint is made from a crushed blue
silicate that mixed with oil produces a brilliant blue tone. Other pigments were achieved in less
pleasant ways. The bright yellow of many Indian paintings? Cow's urine. The red of medieval ox-blood
walls? You guessed it.
