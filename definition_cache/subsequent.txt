For something that comes after something else in time or order, choose the adjective subsequent. If
the entire class fails an exam, the teacher will hopefully make subsequent ones a little easier.

Subsequent comes from the Latin subsequi to follow closely and means just that - following or coming
after. If you say, in 1990 and subsequent years, it includes 1990, whereas the years subsequent to
1990 do not include it. When you mention a car crash and subsequent traffic jam or a scandal and
subsequent investigation, one follows the other in order but a cause and effect relationship is
implied too.
