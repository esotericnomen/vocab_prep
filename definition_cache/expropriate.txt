Use the verb expropriate to describe the act of taking people's property, usually by a government.
If you really like your neighbor's house, you may wish you could expropriate the property.

To correctly pronounce expropriate, say ex-PRO-pree-ate. It sounds a lot like another verb,
appropriate and has a similar meaning. That's because of their shared Latin root proprius, which
means own. Expropriate is typically used to describe taking property â&euro;&rdquo; rather than
smaller possessions â&euro;&rdquo; and a government or other official organization is usually the
one doing the taking. For example, a state may expropriate property in order to build a new road.
