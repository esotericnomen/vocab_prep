If there's a particular time of day when your ten kittens settle down to nap, you can call that
their period of quiescence, or the time when they are all quiet and restful.

The noun quiescence looks similar to the word quiet for a good reason: quiescence is a quiet spell
or state. It's used often to mean dormancy, or the quieting of a symptom or a disease, such as the
quiescence of a child's asthma symptoms during the winter months. The Latin root word is quies,
which means rest or quiet.
