Subsume means to absorb or include. A successful company might subsume a failing competitor through
a merger, or love may subsume you in the early stages of a romance.

Subsume is a verb that comes from the Latin words sub, which means “from below,” and sumere,
which means “take.” So subsume means “to take from below,” like a sneak attack by some kind
of deep-sea creature. Sailors and scuba divers should beware of monsters from the blackest depths
waiting to subsume them.
