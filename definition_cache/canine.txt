Canine is how zoologists refer to all mammals with snouts and non-retractable claws. Sound familiar?
That's right, Fido is a canine. (All dogs are.) Coyotes and wolves are canines, too.

The sharp pointy teeth in your mouth are also called canines.  Like wolves, we use these sharp
incisors to tear meat from the bone, though these days we tend to get some help in that department
from knives and forks.  Fun fact: The police call their drug-sniffing dogs the K-9 unit. Get it?
