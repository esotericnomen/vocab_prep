If you send your client a bill for your consulting services, be sure to include your address so he
knows where to remit the payment.

Remit means send back, and it has many uses. If you remit payment, you send it back to the person
you owe it to. If youâ&euro;&trade;ve been in prison for five years of a seven-year sentence but
youâ&euro;&trade;ve been on good behavior, a judge might remit the remainder of your sentence and
let you go free. If you have a chronic illness and it seems to clear up or go away, we say it is in
remittance.
