To philander is to flirt or casually date a large number of people. If you philander, you don't have
one steady, serious relationship, but instead dabble in many casual ones.

It's most common to say that a man philanders when he is excessively flirtatious or cheats on his
partner with many other people. The word has both a sense of sneakiness and lightheartedness, and it
comes from the now-obsolete noun philander, husband or lover. The name Philander, in fact, was
popular in 18th century literature for the character of a lover, from the Greek word philandros,
with love for the people.
