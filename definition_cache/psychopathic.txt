Psychopathic is a very strong word â€” it means mentally ill or insane and probably dangerous.

Psychopathic isn't a word anyone should take lightly. It refers to an undiagnosed mental disorder.
Murderers and other dangerous people are often psychopathic. If you watch a TV show that features a
character who is dangerous or even deadly, he might be psychopathic. This is a medical word, unlike
crazy, which can mean dozens of things. If you know that someone is psychopathic, stay away: that
person is mentally ill and could hurt you.
