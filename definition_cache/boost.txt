Think of the word boost as meaning help up. Maybe you need a boost getting over a fence (hmm — are
you sneaking in or sneaking out?), or maybe you are feeling low and need to boost your spirits —
chocolate, anyone?

Sometimes words appear that really don't have any clear origins. Boost is one of those words, but
it's a fun word, and it's thought that maybe it has some connection to boose, a Scots dialect word
that carries the idea of a push.  A slang meaning of the word is to sneakily steal, like
shoplifting.  You gave your cousin a boost into the window, not knowing he was planning on boosting
some sneakers.
