Have you ever gotten the sense that politicians or corporate leaders will say anything to turn
public opinion their way? This tricky kind of deceit and manipulation is called chicanery.

Besides chicanery, another funny-sounding word for trickery is shenanigans. Whereas the former is
always used in the singular and involves deceptive language, the latter is usually used in the
plural and refers to the actions of a person. Your crazy neighbor is up to his old shenanigans if he
has begun doing weird stuff again, but if a politician's chicanery is exposed, he will lose public
trust and not be returned to office in the next election cycle.
