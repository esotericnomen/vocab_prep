A callus is a spot where your skin becomes rough and thick. After wearing flip flops every day, all
summer long, you'll probably have a callus between your toes.

If you bet a blister from playing tennis or digging in the garden, it will eventually turn into a
callus if you keep swinging your racquet or using your trowel. Any spot on your skin that's rubbed
and irritated repeatedly becomes a callus, or a thickened patch of skin. In medicine, another kind
of callus is the bony tissue that forms when a broken bone heals. Don't confuse callus with callous
Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; which sounds the same but means insensitive and cruel.
