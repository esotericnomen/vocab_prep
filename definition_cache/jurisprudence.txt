You want a word that’s a whole mouthful? Try jurisprudence, the study and philosophy of law. You
want to study jurisprudence? Get ready for law school, where you’ll find even longer, more
troubling words.

The Latin-based word jurisprudence is made up of two parts, juris of law and prudence which goes
back to mean knowledge. If you study law, you study jurisprudence. You can modify it to show a
specific type of law, so you will find terms such as medical, human rights, Islamic or American
jurisprudence. Sometimes the word is used as a collective to mean the legal world. This is a new
issue that jurisprudence will have to deal with.
