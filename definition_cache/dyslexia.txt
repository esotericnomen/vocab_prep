Dyslexia is a reading disorder. For people who have it, letters seem to move on the page or reverse
themselves when they try to read. If you have dyslexia, you may read '12' as '21,' or 'b' as 'd' or
even 'p.'

Dyslexia is from the Greek roots dys difficult, and lexis word. Although dyslexia literally means
difficulty with words, someone who suffers from dyslexia may also have trouble in other areas like
math, telling time, or even telling left and right. Famous dyslexics include Thomas Edison, John
Lennon, and Whoopi Goldberg.
