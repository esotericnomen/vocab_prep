To niggle means to argue over petty things, like battling over who gets the front seat or bickering
about who's turn it is to take out the garbage.

To niggle is to squabble over something silly or even to persistently nag or worry someone to death.
Etymologists believe the verb niggle could be from Scandinavian roots, but there's no point
quibbling over its unclear origin. All you need to know is that niggling is largely annoying to all
involved.
