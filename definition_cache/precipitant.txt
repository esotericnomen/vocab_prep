A precipitant is a cause or reason for some event. So if you skip your Biology test on March 17th,
your parents might deduce that your enjoyment of the St. Patrick's Day parade was a precipitant of
your actions.

See the pre in precipitant? Since pre means before, you can remember that a precipitant always comes
before something else. Precipitant can also mean hasty Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; a precipitant marriage is one
where both parties marry too quickly. Not to be confused with percipient, meaning someone with
unusual sensitivity and understanding of people and events. A percipient person would never skip his
Biology test.
