Yes, phlegmatic has roots in that colorless, mucousy stuff called phlegm, but people who are
phlegmatic aren't called that because they have lots of mucous. They are just a little dull in
expressing feelings or showing emotion.

It may be their training more than their natural behavior, but those palace guards who wear the red
coats and big hats and show absolutely no expression on their faces are phlegmatic. Attempts to make
them laugh, smile, or twist their faces in irritation wonâ&euro;&trade;t work, because being
phlegmatic is important to their role as stone-faced keepers of the palace. Phlegmatic people show
less emotion on the outside â&euro;&rdquo; but who knows, they may be jumping up and down on the
inside.
