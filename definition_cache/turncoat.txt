Have you ever switched political parties, taken up a different religion, or — worst of all —
changed which sports team you support? You are a turncoat then, a deeply hostile word meaning a
traitor or deserter to the cause.

Turncoat comes from the ancient practice of wearing a badge or pin on one's coat signifying the
party or leader you supported. By turning your coat you quite literally hid your allegiance to
others. Often used interchangeably with defector, and while they are similar they are not quite the
same. Turncoat is worse: it implies no possibility of any good or honest motive. Defector can at
least sometimes have a neutral or even positive implication.
