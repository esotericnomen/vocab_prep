A snare is a trap, usually for small animals, and using a noose. Snare can also mean to trap in
general or any type of trap, like the snare of a TV cliffhanger that traps you into watching again.

If writers are to be believed, we are surrounded by snares. Francis Beaumont implores us to know
that “the world’s a snare.” And Hilda Doolittle asserts that “a snare is Love.” Still
Soren Kierkegaard lets us know that “the truth is a snare: you cannot have it, without being
caught.” Whoever is right, it seems that you can’t escape. A snare is also a type of small drum
that rattles, as well as a wire loop used by surgeons.
