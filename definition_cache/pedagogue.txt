Pedagogue is another name for teacher, but one who is strict, stiff or old-fashioned, as in a
pedagogue who stands in the front of the room and lectures for the entire class period, boring the
students to tears.

The noun pedagogue, pronounced PED-uh-gog, is the Old French word for teacher of children. The
emphasis here is on old. To call a teacher a pedagogue is a deliberate choice because it implies
that he or she is the teacher that time forgot, possibly using notes and handouts from twenty years
ago, standing in that same spot, year after year, saying the same things, as students stare out the
same windows.
