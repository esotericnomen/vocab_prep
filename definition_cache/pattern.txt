Something that repeats in a predictable way is a pattern. You might find a pattern in a series of
numbers, in the material covering your couch, or in the habits of your upstairs neighbor.

The noun pattern could refer to a design or to customary behavior. Your patterns of behavior might
include your morning cup of coffee and exercise. The word pattern can also be used as a verb form
meaning to model. For example, your art might be patterned after the artwork of a famous artist.
