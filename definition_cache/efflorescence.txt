If your artistic career is in a period of efflorescence, that means you are producing the most work
of your life, and it's very good. When something is in efflorescence, it is in bloom.

Inside of efflorescence you see the Latin root flora which means plant. Use this to remember the
blooming nature of the word. Try not to confuse this word with effervescent, which means bubbly and
light, like a glass of seltzer or a cheerleader.
