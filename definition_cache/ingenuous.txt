Someone who is ingenuous shows a childlike innocence, trust, and openness. One of the things
kindergarten teachers value is the chance to work with kids while they're still relatively
ingenuous––their open, trusting natures are a joy.

A near synonym is naive. Its opposite is disingenuous, which means giving a false impression of
being honest and sincere. Don't confuse the word ingenuous with the similarly spelled ingenious,
which means very smart or clever. Ingenuous is from Latin ingenuus having the qualities of people
born free, noble, honest, open, ultimately formed from the prefix in- in plus gignere to produce.
