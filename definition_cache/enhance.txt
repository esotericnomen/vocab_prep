Many people use the expression enhance your chance to point out ways to increase your chances of
winning or earning a contest or prize. When you enhance something, you heighten it or make it
better.

Hance is not a word, but the addition of en- does something to enhance it and improve its sound. You
can enhance the size of something, too, by altering it or raising it, which is what the word
original meant (the hance part came via French from Latin altus, meaning high). When you enhance
something you take it to a higher level, like adding salt to French fries to enhance flavor or
adding words to enhance your vocabulary.
