Revulsion means an intense, violent, sometimes physical, dislike of something. People feel revulsion
to different things. You may feel revulsion at the thought of seeing a horror movie, but other
people can't wait to be scared by the latest zombie or slasher flick.

The noun revulsion comes from the Latin word revellere, meaning to pull away or to pull back. So, if
you think of pulling back in horror when someone suggests going on a roller coaster after lunch,
you'll remember the definition for revulsion is an intense aversion. Synonyms for revulsion include
abhorrence, disgust, horror, and repugnance. After getting the stomach flu after eating raspberries,
you now feel a revulsion to anything raspberry flavored.
