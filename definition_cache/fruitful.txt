When something is fruitful, it's productive — but you don't have to produce fruit in order to be
fruitful. You could have a fruitful trip to the mall if you come home with a slew of snappy new
outfits.

There's a famous line from the Bible: Be fruitful and multiply. That gives you a pretty good sense
of the word: fruitful activity multiplies or adds to what's already there, producing more of
something. A couple is fruitful if they have children: the more children, the more fruitful. An
artist is fruitful if they create a lot of artwork. A business is fruitful if it creates profits and
expands. Anything fruitful is productive: it grows and produces, much like a fruit tree.
