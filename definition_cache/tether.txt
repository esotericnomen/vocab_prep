Both a verb and a noun, tether keeps things tied together, or is the tie itself. Remember, when you
tether that chair to those balloons, use a strong tether. You don't want to drop from the sky
because you tied them together using a cheap piece of rope.

Think of the childhood game tether-ball. The ball is tethered to a pole by a tether. Tether usually
refers to a rope or a chain, but it can also refer to an invisible bond or link. For example, the
Internet can serve as a tether that links you to your pen pal in Germany. The love between a mother
and her child keeps them tethered to each other for a lifetime. And whenever astronauts go for
jaunts outside the space station, they tether themselves to the station using wires and a hook.
