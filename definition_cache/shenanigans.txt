Ever been ripped off at three card monte or some other con? Well, you're the victim of a shenanigan,
a clever form of deception, usually designed to part the unwary from their money.

Not all shenanigans are financially motivated; an equally popular meaning is simply high spirits or
boisterous behavior that might upset or annoy others, though usually not with any serious intent. It
seems to be a word frequently applied to the Irish, with their established love of the high-spirited
and artful ploy, and in fact may well come from the ancient Irish word sionnach, meaning fox -- a
traditionally  sly beast.
