If you are incapacitated, you can’t do what you normally do, what you’re being asked to do —
or perhaps, much of anything. To incapacitate someone is to cause him or her to be unable to
function normally, like a bad cold that incapacitates you.

The verb incapacitate is related to the word capacity. Capacity comes from the Latin word capacitas,
meaning “that can contain,” or how much something — brain, bucket or otherwise — can hold.
The prefix in- reverses the meaning and when the suffix -ate is added, incapacitate means someone
has been made unable to “contain” much — like attention, effort, or energy.
