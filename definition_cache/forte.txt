Forte means an area in which you are strong or good. Having two left feet and no sense of rhythm,
dancing would not be considered your forte. Better to impress people with card tricks, if that's
your area of expertise, or your forte.

Your forte is what you would focus on if you decided to enter a talent show. The word forte actually
comes from the similar-sounding Latin word fortis, which means strong. Romans (and countless groups
since) called the big, barricaded structures they built forts because they were supposed to stay
strong and keep out the hordes of invading barbarians. In music, playing forte means playing loud.
