To verbalize something is to put it into words. If you need to get into the bathroom desperately,
and the person in front of you hasn’t noticed your agitation, you’ll probably have to verbalize
it, and quickly!

Verbalize comes from the word verbal, which describes spoken words. If people are extremely verbose,
that means they talk all the time. Very shy people don't verbalize their feelings very often.
Verbalize can also mean articulate, or clarify. If I’m working for you on a construction site, and
you yell “SLAB!” at me, I might have to ask you to verbalize what you mean by “SLAB!”
