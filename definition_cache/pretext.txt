Pretext is a false reason given for doing something. If you catch your mother going through your
drawers, and she says she was just tidying up, cleaning was her pretext for snooping.

Sometimes a government will try to take away its citizens' rights under the pretext of national
security. Though pretext sounds like text that comes before other text, the text you see in it is
actually more closely related to the word textile, which meaning fabric. Its Latin root meant pretty
much to pull the wool over someone's eyes.
