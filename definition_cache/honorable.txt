The word honorable has to do with people and actions that are honest, fair, and worthy of respect.

An honorable person is someone who believes in truth and doing the right thing Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; and
tries to live up to those high principles. When you lose a game, it's honorable to shake hands. If
you smash into someone's parked car, it's honorable to leave a note so they can contact you. Telling
the truth is honorable. This word is also used for people who are deserving of being honored, like
when judges are called The honorable Judge So-and-so.
