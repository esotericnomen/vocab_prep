If you have a new car, a new high-paying job, and some flashy new shoes, then you could be described
as prosperous, meaning you have material success that seems like it will continue to grow.

The adjective prosperous often describes a person or a person’s future, but it can apply to
anything that’s experiencing growth and success. Prosperous derives from the Latin word prosperus,
meaning “doing well.” Great pronouns of this happy word include golden, well-heeled,
flourishing, and thriving.
