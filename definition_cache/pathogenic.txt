Something that's pathogenic makes you sick, like a virus you pick up after riding on a bus full of
coughing people.

Pathogenic is a medical term that describes viruses, bacteria, and other types of germs that can
cause some kind of disease. The flu, various parasites, and athlete's foot fungus are all considered
to be pathogenic. This word has been used since the late 1800s to mean producing disease, from the
French pathogĂŠnique, which in turn came from the Greek word for disease, pathos.
