A respite is a break from something that's difficult or unpleasant. If you're cramming for exams,
take an occasional walk to give yourself a respite from the intensity.

Respite may look like it rhymes with despite, but this word has a stress on its first syllable (RES-
pit).  It comes from the Latin word respectus, meaning refuge, but we almost always use respite to
describe a time, not a place, of relief. If you've been fighting with your partner, a visit from a
friend might offer a brief respite from the argument, but the fight will pick up again when she
leaves.
