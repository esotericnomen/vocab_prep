When something is notable, it's worthy of notice, or even famous. It might be a notable feature of
your trip to New York City that you spotted one of the city's notable celebrities.

Notable is a very useful word––it allows you succinctly to note that from a long list of things
you could say, you have thoughtfully picked out only the ones that are the most notable, the most
worthy — a notable example of kindness to your listeners.
