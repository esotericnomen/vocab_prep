If something is uncanny, it is so mysterious, strange, or unfamiliar that it seems supernatural. If
you hear strange music echoing through your attic, you might refer to it as positively uncanny.

You can also use uncanny to refer to something that is so remarkable that it is beyond what is
natural: as in uncanny abilities. This adjective was formed in English from the prefix un- not and
canny fortunate, safe. The current meaning of English canny is careful and clever, especially in
handling money.
