A transition is a change from one thing to the next, either in action or state of being—as in a
job transition or as in the much more dramatic example of a caterpillar making a transition into a
butterfly.

Transition is awfully reassuring in its tidy reliance on regular forms. Trans means cross, so when
you hear it at the beginning of a word you know that it indicates crossing, as in transatlantic or
translate. An odd thing happening with transition lately is that it is transitioning from its
familiar form as a noun to a newer life as a verb, as in “We’re going to transition Gloria to
that new job.”
