The premises of a property consist of the land and buildings on it, usually of a business or
organization. If there's no smoking on the premises of a high school, you can't even light up in the
parking lot.

A game of hide-and-go-seek where you can’t leave the house will go a lot faster than one that
permits hiding anywhere on the premises, including outdoors. Premises has another, unrelated meaning
— it can also be the assumption or hypothesis from which a conclusion is drawn. The English writer
Samuel Butler said, “Life is the art of drawing sufficient conclusions from insufficient
premises.” Meaning, much of life is about guesswork.
