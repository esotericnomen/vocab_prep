Comeuppance describes a fate or punishment that's deserved, like an arrogant trash-talking
quarterback who fumbles the ball on the last play and loses the game for his team.

Comeuppance began as a term that meant present oneself for judgment by a tribunal. That was in 1859.
You can picture an accused person approaching a judge, or coming up to the front of a courtroom.
Guilt, innocence â&euro;&rdquo; comeuppance can be either, and it can apply to things beyond the
justice system. Nowadays you'll most likely hear this word describe something bad. If someone gets a
deserved punishment, you'd say He got his comeuppance.
