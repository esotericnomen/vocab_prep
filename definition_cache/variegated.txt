Something variegated has many different colors, as in the trees of autumn or the feathers of a
peacock. Whenever you see vari at the beginning of a word, you know that the idea of difference or
change is involved.

Using vari is a good way to start thinking about this word. It's the same root as in various,
variable, varied, and variety. All these words mean something similar: lots of different versions of
something. The scales of a fish can appear quite variegated from one angle and then strangely
uniform from another. A tiger's variegated coat helps it stay hidden.
