Whether you’re talking about a therapeutic drug or a therapeutic exercise plan, something that is
therapeutic helps to heal or to restore health.

The adjective therapeutic can be traced all the way back to the Greek word therapeutikos (from
therapeuein, meaning “to attend” or “to treat”). Although the word relates to healing or
soothing, therapeutic isn’t reserved only for drugs or medical treatments. You’ve probably heard
particular activities referred to as therapeutic, which just means that doing that activity makes
you feel rejuvenated. You might consider shopping for shoes, for example, to be a therapeutic
activity — at least until the credit card bill arrives.
