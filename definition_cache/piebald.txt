Use the adjective piebald to describe something that has different colored patches â€” especially
black and white patches. If you own a piebald horse, you could name him Spot.

The adjective piebald is a combination of pie and bald. Pie was the original name for magpie a
common European bird known for its black and white coloring. Bald did not mean hairless, but meant a
white patch, especially on the head (think bald eagle). So something piebald has a combination of
black and white coloring and still mostly refers to horses, although the word can refer to other
multicolored things.
