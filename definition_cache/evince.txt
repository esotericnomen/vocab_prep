The verb evince means to show or express clearly; to make plain. Evidence can evince the innocence
of the accused, and tears can evince the grief of the mourning.

Evince is a rather formal word that reveals the presence of something hidden Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; usually
a feeling. So, if you are happy, your smile might evince your happiness. And if you are angry, the
skull and crossbones on your tee shirt might evince your anger. Evincing is about expressing. If you
are keeping your feelings inside, there's not a lot of evincing going on.
