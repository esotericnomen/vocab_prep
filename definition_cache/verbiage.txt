Verbiage is what it sounds like — a lot of words: verbs, nouns, adjectives and all the other parts
of speech. Usually, verbiage means a few too many words — like the excessive verbiage in a legal
document.

Verbiage comes from the 18th-century French verbier, meaning to chatter. Verbiage can mean just the
words being used to communicate, or a bunch of empty words used to obscure communication. Someone
long-winded might receive a sarcastic compliment about his verbiage, while another speaker might
receive genuine applause for intelligent verbiage, or choice of words.
