Use the adjective gentle to describe something that is soothing or kind, like a person with a tender
nature or the soft sound of light rain.

The word gentle traces back to the Latin word gentlis, meaning “of the same clan,” and at first
the world was used to describe people belonging to distinguished families, who were seen as
courteous and noble. Nowadays you’re more likely to hear the word used to refer to things that are
calm, moderate, and without harshness. The word is often applied to people, but it can be used more
broadly to describe anything that is mild, such as a gentle detergent or a gentle reminder.
