Puberty is a time of life when your sex organs start working like an adult's. During puberty, girls
and boys start to become women and men.

One of the most difficult yet exciting times in life has to be puberty: it's an awkward period
between childhood and adulthood when your body rapidly changes. You go through a growth spurt, hair
sprouts in new places. Your sex organs start to work for the first time. Hormones are coursing
through your veins. Your voice may change. So when you think of puberty, think awkward stage.
