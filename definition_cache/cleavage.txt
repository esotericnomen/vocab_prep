Cleavage is a word for a kind of splitting or separation: it's mainly used for the split between a
woman's breasts.

We can talk about many kinds of cleavage, such as the splitting of a cell or a hunk of wood.
Political movements will often have a cleavage, as differences of opinion create factions. This word
is interesting because cleavage is not only a separation, but it can mean a bringing together. When
you think of the cleavage created by a woman's breasts -- stop staring, by the way -- you can see
the separation and bringing together very well.
