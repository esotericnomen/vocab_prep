You don't want to seem anything less than seemly, especially in the presence of the Queen. Only
seemly behavior is allowed when she's around.

Seemly behavior is polite, decent, upright, and appropriate. You'll need to get schooled in the ways
of more seemly people before you can be allowed in the fanciest restaurant in town. At the moment,
your ratty clothes, smelly feet, and bad manners can only be described as unseemly Ã¢&euro;&rdquo;
which is, of course, the opposite of seemly. One way to remember the meaning of seemly is to think
of how you'd like to seem to others. Chances are the answer is something like seemly. Unless you
enjoy seeming like a big mess.
