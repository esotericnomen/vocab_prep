Whether itâ€™s a bike, an old computer, or a tennis stadium, when you refurbish something you clean
it up and make it look or perform better.

When you refurbish something, you generally keep the structure the same but improve its looks and
possibly its functionality. For example, if you renovate a room you may make it new again with
structural changes, such as tearing down walls and altering its original design. If you refurbish
it, however, you will most likely focus on making it look better with cosmetic changes, such as
painting it. The word refurbish is also often used to describe secondhand technology that has been
rebuilt to restore function by replacing a component that has failed.
