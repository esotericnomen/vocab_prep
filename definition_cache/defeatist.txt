Having a defeatist attitude means that you give up before you've even started, like the runner who
is so convinced he's going to lose the race that he doesn't even bother to go to the starting line.

A defeatist is the opposite of an optimist. A defeatist is convinced that he's going to fail, and he
isn't surprised when he does fail. This is how a defeatist might propose to his girlfriend: I'm sure
you're going to say 'no,' so why don't you just go ahead and reject me now.
