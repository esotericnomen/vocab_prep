Commonly referred to as that warm fuzzy feeling, caring is the kindness or love you have towards
another individual. You can also use caring (as an adjective) to describe a person who acts in this
warm and fuzzy way.

There's a reason for the saying caring is sharing. You and your best buddy might exhibit caring, or
affection, by sharing secrets, hugs, and the contents of your lunch boxes. Caring can also be an
adjective. Caring nurses, parents, and teachers are great caregivers because they dole out warm
fuzziness all day long. Well, at least sometimes.
