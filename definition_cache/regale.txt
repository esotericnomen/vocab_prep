You may have heard it said that the fastest way to a person’s heart is through his stomach. So, if
you need to please or impress someone, regale them — that is, treat them to lavish food and drink.

While food is reliable way to regale someone, regale can also involve providing forms of
entertainment such as music or storytelling. Regale is akin to the word gala, meaning “a festive
party,” and gallant, which can mean “spirited and adventurous” (though gallant can also mean
“noble and brave”). If you regale someone with a gala attended by partygoers who are gallant, in
either sense of the word, everyone should have a pretty good time.
