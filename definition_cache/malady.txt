A malady is an illness, like a malady that keeps you home, sick in bed for days, or something that
causes you to have trouble or to suffer, like jet lag — a malady that affects travelers.

Malady, pronounced MAL-uh-dee, comes from the Latin words male, meaning bad or ill and habitus for
have, hold. When you have a malady, it is like something bad is holding you, such as an illness —
the common cold: a malady of winter. Some bad habits cause maladies, such as never having any money
— the malady of people who spend freely, not thinking of the future.
