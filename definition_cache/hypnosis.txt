Hypnosis is a trance-like state induced by a hypnotist in which the subject becomes highly open to
suggestions by others. In movies, hypnosis usually starts with the phrase, You are feeling very
sleepy...

Thanks to a million bad TV shows and stage hypnotists â&euro;&rdquo; look into my eyes, you are
feeling sleepy... â&euro;&rdquo; we tend to think of hypnosis as making its unfortunate subjects
think they're birds and run around flapping their arms for our amusement. In fact, modern day
hypnosis is more commonly used by therapists to help people modify undesirable behaviors such as
smoking or anxiety. Helpful, if not as much fun.
