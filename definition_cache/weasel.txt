A weasel is a sneaky and sly person. Your weasel of a friend has a habit of forgetting his wallet
every time he goes out to dinner with you.

You can call someone who cheats and lies a weasel, or you can use the word literally, to refer to
the small furry mammal called a weasel. The furry kind of weasel is known for its short legs, long
neck, and musky smell. In fact, the word's Proto-Germanic origin wisand carries the meaning of a
stinky animal. The verb weasel means to sneak or evade, like when you weasel out of doing the
dishes.
