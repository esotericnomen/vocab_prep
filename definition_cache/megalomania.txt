Megalomania is a crazy hunger for power and wealth, and a passion for grand schemes. Comic book
villains often suffer from megalomania. Their plans are thwarted only by superheroes.

Megalomania comes from the Greek megas (great) and mania (madness). It is a madness of greatness,
but not a great kind of madness! Megalomaniacs in history: Alexander the Great, Genghis Khan,
Napoleon Bonaparte, Josef Stalin, and maybe even the tycoon Donald Trump.
