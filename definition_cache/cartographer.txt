Unless you’re the one guy in America who actually asks for directions, you’ve probably broken
down and used a map at some point in your life. The cartographer is the person you should thank for
getting you un-lost — the mapmaker.

A cartographer is a person who creates maps, whether they’re of the world, the local bus routes,
or buried pirate treasure. It comes to us from the Latin word charta-, which means “tablet or leaf
of paper,” and the Greek word graphein, meaning to write or draw. These days, a cartographer
doesn’t have to work on paper––it's all computers, making electronic maps as part of GPS
software. Technically, a cartographer can make charts, too.
