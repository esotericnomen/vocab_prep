Did you know that if you say credulity ten times fast it starts to sound like orange? If you believe
that, then you have a lot of credulity. Credulity means gullibility, or a willingness to believe
anything.

Credulity is a tendency to believe in things too easily and without evidence.  If a swindler is
trying to sell you fake medicine, then he is preying on your credulity. This noun is associated with
being naïve, gullible or innocent. It shouldn’t be confused with credibility, which means
“believability,” although it is often misused in this way. You might hear someone say, “the
farfetched plot of that movie strained credulity,” but what he or she really means is
“believability,” or “credibility.”
