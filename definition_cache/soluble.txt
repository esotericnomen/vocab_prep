Sugar is soluble. It dissolves easily in water. You can also use the word to describe a problem that
can be solved easily.

How are the two definitions of soluble related? When you dissolve something in a liquid, the
combination is known as a solvent or a solution. All of these sol- words descend from the Latin word
that means loosen or unfasten. When you dissolve something in water, you loosen the molecules. And
if you think of a problem like a knot, to solve it is to loosen it up.
