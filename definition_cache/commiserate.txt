When you commiserate with your buddies, you're sharing your lousy feelings. People who commiserate
have the same negative feelings about something.

Take a look at how commiserate is built: it's from Latin com-, which means together with, and
miserÄ rÄŤ, to pity. Put them together, and you get to pity one another, commiserate. When you
commiserate, you and your fellow commiserators talk about how badly you're all feeling. After the
layoffs, we all went to the bar to commiserate.
