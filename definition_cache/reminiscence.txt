A reminiscence is a memory, or the act of recovering it. A visit to your old elementary school may
flood your brain with reminiscences––things you hadn't thought of in years coming suddenly back.

Many people find that when they travel or have quiet time to think, their brain becomes occupied
with reminiscence. You can see how close the word reminiscence is in meaning to the word
remember––you might think of the word reminiscence as a remembering.
