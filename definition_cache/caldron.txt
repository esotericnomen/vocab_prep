A caldron is a large cooking pot, often with handles. If you're planning to cook chili for an entire
Super Bowl crowd, it is recommended you use the caldron and not the saucepan.

A famous scene from William Shakespeare's play Macbeth shows the three witches casting a spell as
they add ingredients into a caldron. Each time they add something to the big pot, like eye of newt
or lizard's leg, they repeat the chorus of their spell in unison: Double, double toil and trouble;
Fire burn, and caldron bubble.
