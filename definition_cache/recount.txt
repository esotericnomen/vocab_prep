As a verb, recount can mean either tell the story of or add up again. As a noun, recount usually
refers to the second (or third or fourth) tallying of votes in a close election.

The word count comes from the old French conter, which means add up or tell a story. Here's a story
to recount (narrate): In an election featuring Count Dracula and Count Johnson, Dracula wins by two
votes, so Johnson demands a recount (an adding up of the votes again). The officials recount (count
again) the votes, and this time find Count Johnson the winner. Dracula threatens to bite the
officials and they quickly change their minds.
