A panoply is a collection or an assortment of things. You might be eager to show off your panoply of
bobble-head dolls when friends come to your house.

An array or display of things is a panoply, so you can show off your panoply of spooky clown
paintings, but you can also display a panoply of dance moves or talk about the panoply of flags at
the parade Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; as long as it's a complete or impressive display, it's a true panoply. In
ancient Greece, the word was used exclusively to talk about military costumes which were always
suits of armor.
