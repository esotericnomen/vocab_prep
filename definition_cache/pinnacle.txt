Going as far into the sky as you can go on foot, you'll reach the highest point, or pinnacle, of the
Himalayas. A successful climb like that might also become the pinnacle, or peak, of your success.

Two synonyms for pinnacle also start with the letter p, peak and point. A pinnacle can be a physical
thing, like the top of a high mountain or the antenna on the very top of a building, or it can be a
high point that can√¢&euro;&trade;t be measured with a ruler, like an achievement or a goal.
Whatever the pinnacle is, reaching it is almost always a completion of something where you have gone
the highest you can go. Acme is a great synonym for pinnacle.
