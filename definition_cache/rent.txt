To rent something is to pay money to use it, live in it, or borrow it. If you're not sure which
musical instrument you'll stick with and enjoy playing, it's best to rent a few to try out before
buying.

Rent is both a verb and a noun for talking about things you don√¢&euro;&trade;t own. If you rent a
house or an apartment, you pay money to live there, and the money you pay also is rent. You can rent
just about anything, from skates at a roller park to furniture to fill the home you rent. One common
thing about what you rent, though, is that you don't and won't own it. To rent is to pay for using
something temporarily.
