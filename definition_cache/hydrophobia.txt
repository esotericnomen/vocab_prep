Foaming at the mouth? Terrified of drinking water? You're displaying all the signs of hydrophobia, a
common symptom of rabies. Unfortunately by this point you're probably beyond curing. Or reading
online definitions.

Take hydro (meaning water) and phobia (meaning fear) and you have hydrophobia â&euro;&rdquo; a fear
of water. This could be a purely psychological issue that started in the lake at summer camp, or it
could be physically motivated by disease â&euro;&rdquo; such as rabies.
