A pittance is a tiny payment or small reimbursement for work — generally an amount that's
inadequate. The restaurant may pay you a pittance, but you can do well if you get a lot of good
tips.

The word pittance came into English from the Old French word pitance, meaning “allowance of food
to a monk or poor person,” which in turn came from the Latin word pietas, meaning “pity.”
Although a pittance may have originally meant that you were taking pity on someone with less wealth
by giving them money or food, these days when you get a pittance it means that you earn a pitiful
wage.
