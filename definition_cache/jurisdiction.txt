Jurisdiction means having a legal right over something. A court can have jurisdiction over a legal
question, a government can have jurisdiction over another country or territory. Even your parents
could be said to have jurisdiction over you while you're under 18.

This noun jurisdiction descends from Latin jūrisdictiō, formed from jūris (from jūs law) plus
dictio act of saying. Think of it as who has the right to say what's the law. In the US, certain
crimes are tried in state courts, but when a crime involves more than one state, jurisdiction moves
to the federal court system, just as the local police step down and the investigation is handled by
the FBI.
