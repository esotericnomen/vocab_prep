Sometimes stem means to originate; other times it means to stop something its source. You stem the
flow of a river, but you can also observe that a river’s flow stems from a spring.

To remember stem’s meaning think of the stem of a plant––it’s where a plant begins but also
where you pluck it from the ground. Once teachers realized that the students’ anger stemmed from
the overload of homework, they stemmed the rebellion’s tide.
