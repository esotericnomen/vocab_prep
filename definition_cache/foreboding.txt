When you get a foreboding, you get a sense that something bad is going to happen. A foreboding is a
foretelling, a sign or a glimpse, that something wicked this way comes — or might come.

If something doesn’t bode well, it means that the future doesn't look good. A foreboding is a
glimpse or a feeling that bad things are going to happen. It's a premonition, or look into the
future. Most times foreboding implies that something evil is coming, but sometimes it's used for
anything bad up ahead, as in she had a foreboding that the trip would get canceled due to the
hurricane. Even if the future looks bright, a foreboding casts dread over what's ahead.
