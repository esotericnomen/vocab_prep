To tarry is to linger and take your time leaving. If you really like going to Sally’s Diner for
dessert, you might tarry over coffee and end up leaving after they’ve closed the kitchen.

The verb tarry is perfect for describing what happens when those relatives that you see once a year
come to your house for lunch and never seem to leave. When people tarry they stick around and take a
long time to depart, sometimes lurking or loitering, or sometimes enjoying each other's company.
Tarry can also mean to hang around a place without purpose. You might tarry in the park until the
day is fading and you have to go home.
