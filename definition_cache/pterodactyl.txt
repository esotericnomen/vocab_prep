Pretend that you are living during the Cretaceous period. Then look up at the sky. That fierce
winged creature swooping down on you is a pterodactyl, a flying reptile.

The word pterodactyl, pronounced tear-uh-DACK-til, refers to a now-extinct group of winged reptiles
known as pterosaurs. The word comes from the Latin Pterodactylus, the creatures' genus name, which
originated in the Greek pteron, meaning “wing,” and daktulos, meaning “finger.” Although
technically not a dinosaur, this flying reptile thrived during the same time period is as often seen
among dinosaurs in movies.
