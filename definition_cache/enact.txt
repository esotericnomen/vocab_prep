You often hear that Congress is going to enact a new statute, which means that they will make it
into a law. But enact also means to perform, like in a play. (Makes you wonder if the lawmakers are
actors!)

Inside the word enact is that little word act, meaning “to do.” That makes sense, because when
you enact something, you make it happen. And of course, we know that to act also means to perform,
and so enact means “to act out,” like on stage.  Now that the new rules have been enacted,
you'll have to stop wearing your gorilla suit to work.  Even after Labor Day.
