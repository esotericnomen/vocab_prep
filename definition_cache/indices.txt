Can’t find any information on the yellow-eyed junco in your guide to rare birds? Check out your
bird book's index. It’s an alphabetical list in the back of the book that catalogs all of the
subjects covered by page number.

In financial terms, an index is a list of stocks that are traded on the stock market, such as the
Dow Jones Indexes. “Index cards” were once used to catalog books in a library, but now they’re
mostly used to prepare for a test or a presentation, thanks to computers. As a verb, index describes
the action of creating an index, such as, “I’m going to index my photo collection on my
computer, so I can find what I’m looking for.”
