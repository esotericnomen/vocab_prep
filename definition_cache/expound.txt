If given recipe directions that include some sugar, some onions, and some flour as ingredients, you
might ask the cook to expound by adding measurements of how much of each to use. When you expound,
you explain or provide details.

Expound came into English from a 14th-century French word espondre meaning to elaborate or put
forth. Often when you expound something you are clarifying or giving the particulars. A more formal
way to expound is to offer exposition, often going line by line to explain precise meanings in a
text or legal document.
