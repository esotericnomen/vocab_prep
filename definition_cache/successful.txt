If you win or do well, at whatever it is you do, you are successful. Successful people usually get
more money, attention, and praise.

If you go into business and make a lot of money, you're successful. If you play tennis and finish
the season with more wins than losses, you've been successful. If you have a successful pregnancy,
you give birth to a healthy baby. Successful is one of those words that covers a great deal of
ground; it generally applies to anything, anyone or any venture that ends well. When you see the
word successful, think Winning!
