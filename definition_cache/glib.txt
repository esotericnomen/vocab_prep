A hiring manager might think you're being glib, or slick and insincere, if you say you've led a
successful multinational corporation when you were actually in charge of flipping burgers for a
fast-food restaurant chain.

The word glib might be used to describe the slick car salesman who uses his polished sales pitch to
talk his customers into buying lemons. In fact, the word comes from old German and Dutch words for
slippery, another word that could be used to describe the very same salesman. In addition to meaning
smooth and persuasive, glib can be applied to the kind of thoughtless comment that could get you
into big trouble. Telling your boss that you had a hot time with his daughter is the kind of glib
remark that could end your career.
