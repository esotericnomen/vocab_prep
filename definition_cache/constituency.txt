If you're an elected official, your constituency is the group of people whose interests you were
elected to represent.

A constituency can be described in general as the population living in a district, state, or region,
but it can also be any smaller section of that population, such as individuals or small groups
advocating for specific issues. Your main constituency usually refers to the people whose needs you
feel most strongly about, or the people who are most loyal to you.
