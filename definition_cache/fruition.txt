An idea that is made real, such as a plan or an apple, has come to fruition.

Fruition is a happy word: it's derived from the Latin, frui, meaning to enjoy. We like it when our
hard work pays off and ideas come to fruition, like Sally, who was thrilled when her plan to get
into law school came to fruition. When the kids' idea to start a wild tricycle gang came to
fruition, they sped off joyfully. It refers to the state of bearing fruit, too, like when apples in
the orchard come to fruition. The trees are probably happy then, too.
