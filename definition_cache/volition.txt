When you do something voluntarily, you do it of your own volition, or will. Doing something
willingly, or because you agree to it, is doing something of your own volition.

Volition comes from Latin and French roots meaning wish or will. Legal speech and writing often
include the word volition, as a way to affirm that a person involved in a crime acted on their own
volition, or consented to be part of the crime. Maybe criminals don't wish to go to jail, but their
acts often show their volition to break the law.
