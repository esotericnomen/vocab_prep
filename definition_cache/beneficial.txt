If it's beneficial, then it's good for you â€” or for something. Studying is beneficial to your
grades. Exercise is beneficial to your health.

Spend any time with Italians and you will hear the word bene over and over. It comes straight from
Latin, and Italians use it as often as we use good; it can mean fine, okay, yummy, or kind and well
behaved. Bene gives us beneficial, but also benefit, beneficent, benevolent and more well-meaning
words.
