The verb indite, rarely used today, means compose or put down in writing, like when you find a quiet
place to sit down with your notebook and pen and indite a journal entry or a first draft of a short
story.

To indite is to write something creative — you indite a letter, and jot a grocery list. Don't
confuse indite with its homophone indict, which means to charge with a crime. Both come from the
Latin word dictare, meaning “to declare.” Even if you indite a really bad poem, critics won't
indict you.
