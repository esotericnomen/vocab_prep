Scaredy cats around the globe know that quivering is a trembling, shaking motion. A cold gust of
wind might make you quiver, as would an icy glare from the abominable snowman.

The verb to quiver means to shudder, wobble, or vibrate, often from fear. But the noun quiver? It's
actually the carrying case for your arrows, just the kind of thing Robin Hood would have strapped to
his back. So imagine one of his arrows sailing through the air, hitting a tree with a hearty whack!,
and then quivering there for a few seconds.
