Nondescript is a word used to describe something that isn't special or unusual in any way. You might
have trouble finding a nondescript apartment building because it looks exactly like every other
apartment building around it.

You could use the word nondescript to describe your blind date if she was completely uninteresting
and dull, both in looks and personality. Some houses are so nondescript that you have to drive by
several times just to make sure it's the right one.
