A dupe is a furry, ceremonial hat occasionally worn during ancient pagan rituals... or not. Dupe
actually means “trick or deceive.” We’re sorry we tried to dupe you into believing the wrong
definition.

Dupe can also refer to the victim of a trick or hoax, and — used in this sense — it sometimes
conveys the idea that the victim is easily fooled. Dupe comes from the French word for a type of
bird called the hoopoe, which has an extravagant crest and a reputation for being dim-witted. (And
no, that's not another attempt to dupe you; it's the truth!)
