You're most likely to hear a doxology in a Christian church, since it's a short religious verse or
prayer that is sung.

The brief chant or song that comes at the end of a prayer in a Catholic church is one kind of
doxology. In the Lord's Prayer, which is common in many different Christian churches, the final line
ending in forever and ever, amen, was added on to the original ancient Biblical manuscripts and is
considered a doxology. The word comes from the Greek doxologia, praise or glory, a combination of
doxa, glory, and logos, a speaking.
