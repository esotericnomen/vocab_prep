A game is a contest or pastime. Football, checkers, Monopoly, volleyball, Ms. Pacman â€”  they're
all fun games to play.

Some games are simple, like Connect Four or Tic Tac Toe. Others are played for millions of dollars,
like professional basketball. Games usually have winners and losers, and people play them because
they're fun. Other meanings of this word have less to do with playing: If you're a salesperson, you
could say you're in the sales game. Wild animals that you hunt and eat are called game. And being
game can mean you have disabled feet or legs.
