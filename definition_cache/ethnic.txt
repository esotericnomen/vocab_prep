An ethnic group encompasses a group of people with a unique culture. People from Bosnia form an
ethnic group called Bosnians, and they share common cultural traditions, which often focus on
hospitality and family.

The word ethnic comes from the Greek ethnos, nation, people. Groups of people from specific areas
who share the same or similar customs are ethnic groups. People who resettle in other countries
often bring their distinctive traditions with them, including language, food, lifestyle, and music.
There are ethnic restaurants, shops, and neighborhoods around the world, including Indian buffets,
Italian shoe makers, and Greek Towns and China Towns.
