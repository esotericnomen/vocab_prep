A neatly and stylishly dressed man can be described as dapper. If you like to wear a well-made
fedora, you appreciate clothes. Place a brightly colored feather in the brim and youâ€™re dapper.

Dapper is a Germanic word coming from the Middle Dutch word for elegant. Think of the words dashing,
jaunty and spiffy when you think of dapper as these are all near synonyms. All of these words are
used specifically to describe men. Although there doesn't seem to be a parallel term for a well-
dressed woman, if you call her chic or stylish, she will be pleased.
