When you're talking about something structural you're talking about the way it's built. The simple
look of a building can mask its complex structural design.

A skeleton is the structural framework of a body. While we all look different on the outside, for
the most part, we all share the same structural components Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; we're built the same way.
Some buildings, such as the Eiffel Tower, reveal their structural design completely. They are
nothing but structure. Other buildings work hard to hide their structural qualities. You can discuss
the structural nature of ideas too, as in structural economics or even human relationships.
