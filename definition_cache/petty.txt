Petty used to mean just petite or small, but now it's used for things that are trivial and
shouldn’t matter much. If you host world leaders and spend more time picking napkins than
memorizing names, you're focused on petty things.

A few neutral meanings of petty are still in use today — such as petty cash, which refers to a
small amount of cash on hand — but most uses of petty since the 16th century are negative, as in
narrow-minded, trivial, and of little importance. A petty argument is a popular expression, because
many people get all worked up over something that isn't very important — a petty concern — that
seems much smaller after the heat of the moment.
