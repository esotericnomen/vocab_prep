Use the adjective graceful to describe movements that are lovely and elegant. If you watch a yoga
class, you'll see a variety of styles, ranging from awkward to graceful.

Were some people born graceful? From their elegant way they move to their great timing and well-
chosen words, being graceful does seem to come naturally to some. For others, it comes with practice
and being focused. For example, the discipline of ballet makes dancers graceful Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; even
when reaching for something on a high shelf at the grocery store.
