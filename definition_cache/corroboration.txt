If you tell your boss you couldn't go to work because you were sick and then produce a doctor's
note, that's corroboration — a fancy term for evidence — something that backs up a statement or
a theory.

Corroboration is probably the kind of word you wouldn't use in casual conversation; you would more
likely use proof, for example. It's generally used in a more technical or formal sense, regarding a
legal case, perhaps, or a scientific experiment, as in: Physicists today are finding increasing
corroboration that Einstein's theories were correct.
