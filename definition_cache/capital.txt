You might remember the definition of the adjective capital because its original meaning refers to
your head, which is what you put a cap on, but it's come to mean the top of things or the best
example of something.

The word capital comes from the Latin word capitalis, or head, which some would argue is the command
center of your body. Because your head is so important, capital has come to refer to the top of
something like a building, or the national or state seat of a government, or the best example of
something. It can be easily confused with the American word capitol, which refers to the actual
buildings where government and legislative activities take place.
