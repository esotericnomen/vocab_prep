To be prescient is to have foresight or foreknowledge. We can use this word to describe people
themselves, or what they say or do at a given moment.

You probably know that the Latin prefix pre- means before, so you might be able to figure out that
the word prescient, from the verb praescire, means to know beforehand. People like economists,
sports commentators, and political analysts often get tagged with this word, because it's part of
their job to sift through the data and make predictions Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; and sometimes they get it
right. And when they're not just lucky, we might say they're prescient.
