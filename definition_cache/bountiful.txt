Bountiful means abundant or given generously. We celebrate the idea of a bountiful harvest with a
Thanksgiving cornucopia overflowing with its tastier bounty of pumpkins, apples, squashes, tomatoes,
and grapes.

Bountiful can also mean generously given, with the idea that the original bounty of a harvest came
from the gods you prayed to for rain and sun. When you received their gifts, you thanked them for
their generosity. Now, bountiful giving is something you might experience with your parents or
grandparents, happy just to see you smile on your birthday.
