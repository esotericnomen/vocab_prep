To enjoin is to issue an urgent and official order. If the government tells loggers to stop cutting
down trees, they are enjoining the loggers to stop.

Enjoin looks like it should mean bring together, and at one time, it did have that meaning. But in
current usage, the only thing enjoin brings together is a command and the person on the receiving
end of that order. If your doctor enjoins you to stop smoking, he is suggesting strongly that you
quit.
