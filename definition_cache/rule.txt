A rule is a regulation or direction for doing some particular activity. If you have a no shoes rule
at your house, it means everyone has to take them off at the door.

Other than laws or conditions about what can't and can't be done, rules can be tried-and-true tips
like a grammar rule about subject-verb agreement or a spelling rule about making a singular noun
plural. Rule can also pertain to power Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; how someone handles it or how long it lasts,
like the peaceful rule of a king whose rule lasted 50 years.
