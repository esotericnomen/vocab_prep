The noun consanguinity means relation by blood, so if you want to dazzle your brother, point out
that consanguinity isn't the only reason you hang out with him â€” he's also a great guy!

Consanguinity comes from the Latin com- together and sanguineus of blood, which itself can be traced
back even farther, to the early 14th century when the Old French word sanguin (fem. sanguine) meant
a type of red cloth. So blood gets its name from the vivid red color it matches, and consanguinity
describes the people who, as family members, share the same blood.
