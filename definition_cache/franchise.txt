A franchise is a right granted by a government or corporation to an individual or group of
individuals. One of the most important government-issued rights — so important it's known simply
as the franchise — is the right to vote.

In its more commercial meaning, the fast-food chain McDonalds is a franchise. So are Burger King and
Kentucky Fried Chicken and the New York Yankees. In other words, businesses from which you can buy a
license in order to sell or use their products. More recently, the term has come to have an
intellectual meaning as well, as in a particular series of books or films, such as the Harry Potter
franchise.
