A vendetta is blood feud, a quest for revenge. In Corsica, a vendetta will separate families for
generations, with members of one family murdering those of the other, all to satisfy an ancient
grudge.

If a friend of yours breaks into your locker and fills it with crumpled up newspaper, you will not
be able to hold your head up until you have carried out a vendetta. Perhaps you can tie his shoes
together during French class without his noticing?
