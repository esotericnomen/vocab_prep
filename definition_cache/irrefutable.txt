Have you ever had to prove a point? If so, you probably needed to find evidence that could not be
denied — that was absolutely true. That evidence would be considered irrefutable, impossible to
disprove.

The adjective irrefutable comes from the Latin verb refutāre, repel or beat, with the added
negative prefix in-. Some things are simply irrefutable. These are things based in logic (if a=b and
b=c, then a=c), or in fact (George Washington was the first president of the United States). But
some things that are irrefutable, while maybe not logical, are simply not arguable, as when someone
responds to Why not? with Because I don't want to!
