Repugnance means strong distaste for something. If you love animals, you probably feel repugnance
for people who mistreat their horses.

The word repugnance comes from Latin root words, re, meaning back, and pugnare,  to fight. When we
use repugnance, we don't just mean the feeling of fighting back or resisting, but also a feeling of
horror or sickness that causes you to resist in the first place. If something grosses you out, you
feel repugnance for it. Repugnance can also express a feeling of moral horror: you probably feel
repugnance at photographs of torture.
