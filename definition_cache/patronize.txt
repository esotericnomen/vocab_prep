If you patronize a business, you shop there regularly. But if someone patronizes you, it's not so
pleasant — they talk to you as if you were inferior or not very intelligent.

Patronize comes from Latin patronus protector, master, related to pater father. So if you patronize
a person, you talk down to them like a father might do to his child or a master to his apprentice.
If you want to take an advanced class and your advisor warns you of all the hard work, you can tell
him to stop patronizing you — you know a hard class involves hard work. This sounds much better
than saying, I'm not stupid!
