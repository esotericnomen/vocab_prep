A grievance is a complaint.  It can be formal, like an employee files grievance because of unsafe
working conditions, or more of an emotional matter, like a grievance against an old friend who
betrayed you.

A grievance is a complaint that may or may not be justified. Often a grievance is a complaint about
something that breaks a rule or a law, like a grievance filed against a person who builds a fence in
his front yard in a town that does not allow that. If that same neighbor plants flowers he knows
make you sneeze uncontrollably, you might be unhappy about that, but this is the kind of grievance
you can work out among yourselves.
