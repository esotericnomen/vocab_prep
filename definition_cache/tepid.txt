Tepid means lukewarm or half-hearted. If the applause for your mime-on-a-unicycle performance was
more tepid than enthusiastic, it might be time to find a new hobby.

Around 1400, the word tepid evolved from the Latin tepidus, an adjective meaning “lukewarm,”
which before that came about from the Latin tepere, a verb meaning “to be warm.” Tepid people or
things are lukewarm or lacking in enthusiasm or emotion. Bathwater that’s been sitting in the tub
for two hours is probably tepid. So was the hug you gave your least favorite ex when you ran into
him at the movie theater.
