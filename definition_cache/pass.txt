A document that lets you go somewhere or do something is a pass. You can have a backstage pass at a
concert, a three-day pass from a military base, or a hall pass for using the restroom during class.

If you hand something to someone, you can use the verb pass, like when your dad asks you to pass the
mashed potatoes. If the hand off is more of a throw or toss, then you are probably referring to a
sports pass. You can't complain that no one will pass you the ball if you always stay on the
opposite end of the court from where the action is.
