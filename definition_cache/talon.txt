A talon is a large, hooked claw. Although talons are usually associated with eagles, hawks and other
birds of prey, you can also use the word to describe the flesh-tearing claws or fingernails of
raptors, werewolves or even enraged preschoolers.

Talons typically belong to predators — the word implies bloody attack. An owl uses talons to stab
and kill its prey. A chicken, however, uses claws to pick at its feathers and scratch around in the
dirt. You can also pull talons into the conversation to be funny or sarcastic: “Hey! Get your
talons off that piece of cake. It’s mine.”
