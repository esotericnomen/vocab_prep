When faced with a situation when you need to act, sometimes you freeze.  That feeling is called
impuissance, when you’re unable to make a move because you feel like you have no power.

Thinking about world hunger, nuclear war, climate change, and vocabulary may inspire feelings of
despair, like there’s nothing to be done and you might as well give up.  Bless the French, because
they came up with a single word that means exactly that: impuissance. It literally means “not
powerful,” and feeling powerless is the key ingredient in impuissance.  It’s tricky to
pronounce, but imagine you’re in France and try it this way: im-PWIS-since.  You’ll feel more
powerful in no time.
