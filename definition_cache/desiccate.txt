The verb desiccate means to dry out, dry up and dehydrate. It's helpful to desiccate weeds but
certainly not crops.

As anyone who's been stuck in the desert will tell you, being desiccated by the burning sun isn't
much fun. Stemming from the Latin word desiccare, which means to dry up, desiccate also means to
preserve something by drying it out. Without desiccation, raisins or beef jerky would not be
possible!
