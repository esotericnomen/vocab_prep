Insolence is an act of or the trait of being a jerk, especially to someone you should respect.
Insolence is what rude and stuck-up people show off every chance they get. They ignore their
parents, walk out on dinner bills, elbow old people out of the way, and tell professors their

insolence when they get to the age when they think their parents are stupid. (It usually wears off.)
