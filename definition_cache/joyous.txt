Someone or something joyous is characterized by joy: extreme, exuberant, deep happiness. If you won
the lottery, you’d probably feel joyous.

Joyous is a strong word for the absolute best moments in life. Weddings and graduations are usually
described as joyous occasions. You would feel joyous if you accomplished a lifelong goal, such as
earning a gold medal in the Olympics. In other words, joyous goes beyond the simple feeling of
happiness you might get from watching your favorite TV show or eating a delicious sandwich —
unless of course it’s a really amazing sandwich.
