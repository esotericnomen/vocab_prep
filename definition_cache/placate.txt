When a husband shows up with flowers after he's fought with his wife, he's trying to placate her. If
you placate someone, you stop them from being angry by giving them something or doing something that
pleases them.

If your little sister is mad that the dog ate her favorite teddy bear, you could placate her by
buying her an ice cream cone. A near synonym for placate is appease. The origin of placate is Latin
placare to calm or soothe. The related Latin verb placere is the source of English please.
