If you're a canny investor, you know how to spend money to make money — that  is, you're prudent,
farsighted, and capable of protecting your own interests, particularly in matters of finance or
business.

In contemporary usage, canny is a synonym for shrewd. Both words mean smart or sharp-witted, but
they also suggest that someone is smart in a self-serving and possibly even tricky way. Canny is
also related to the word cunning — another adjective meaning wise, but with negative connotations.
Uncanny is not the opposite of canny —  it means weird or unsettling.
