Many times, a person suspected of something illegal by the authorities is placed under surveillance,
meaning he or she is closely watched to see if their suspicions are well-founded.

If you break down the word surveillance you get the prefix sur, from the French word for over and
the root veiller, meaning to watch. All of which is a roundabout way of saying that if you are under
surveillance, you are being closely watched Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; usually by the authorities, and usually
not for a good reason! Those surveillance cameras in banks and stores are put there in the hopes of
both preventing crimes and recognizing criminals after a crime has been committed.
