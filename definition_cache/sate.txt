Sometimes you're so hungry you feel like you could eat a ten-course meal. Other times it takes just
a small salad to sate your appetite, or to satisfy your hunger.

The verb sate comes from the Old English sadian, “to satiate,” and can be applied to any
situation regarding the satisfaction of a need or an appetite.  If you have been craving something
sweet, your craving might be sated by a bag of jellybeans. However, if it seems like you can never
get enough jellybeans, your appetite for sweets might be described as insatiable, a word used to
describe a person or entity whose appetites — literally or figuratively — are impossible to
satisfy.
