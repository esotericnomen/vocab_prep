Foray means brief excursion. If you're in the army, that's a literal excursion into enemy territory.
For the rest of us, it means trying something out. My foray into rugby ended with my spending a week
in the hospital.

This word derives from the Latin fuerre 'straw', which led into Old French as fourager 'forage,' or
search for food. Think of soldiers stealing food from the enemy as maybe how this word first came to
be used. Even if that is historically inaccurate, your foray into amateur word-sleuthing will help
you remember this word.
