That fancy pin your Grandma used to wear on her blouse or lapel? It's a brooch, held in place by a
sharp needle clasp.

Okay, it's a bit unfair to say Grandmothers alone wear brooches, but they do tend to be worn more by
powerful older women Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; witness Margaret Thatcher and Madeleine Albright (both noted
brooch wearers). Not surprisingly, brooch is derived from the old French word brooch, meaning a long
needle.
