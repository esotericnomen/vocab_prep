The verb domineer means to rule with tyranny and absolute power, like what may occur in a
dictatorship — or possibly within a household if one person is a little too bossy.

If you’ve ever been around someone who tends to domineer, it won’t surprise you to learn that
the word domineer can be traced all the way back to the Latin word dominus, meaning “lord,
master.” It can certainly seem like a person with an impulse to domineer acts like your lord and
master. The word also has an adjective form, domineering, which is used to describe those with a
tendency to domineer.
