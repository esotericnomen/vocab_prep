A clique is an exclusive group of people or friends. Before Rudolph pulled Santa's sled through the
fog, the clique of flying reindeer never let him play their reindeer games.

In high school, the exclusive nature of cliques causes a lot of hurt feelings. Clique carries this
less than nice feeling with it wherever it goes, whether it be a set of elites who surround a
government official, a group of popular kids who don't let others join their group or the closed
circle of people at the office who always make sure they get the best jobs.
