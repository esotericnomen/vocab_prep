When you blackball someone, you ban him from a group. A bunch of kids who kick a tattletale out of
their secret club essentially blackball him.

You can use blackball as a noun or a verb Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; a blackball is an act of excluding or
ostracizing someone. Country club members might initiate a blackball against an eccentric member who
wears tie dyed t-shirts on the golf course, for example. The origin of the word goes back to the
1700s, when club members would cast secret votes on membership using white and black wooden or ivory
balls. The black balls represented no votes.
