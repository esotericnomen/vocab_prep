Anybody or anything that's attractive is visually pleasing or draws you in.

Being attractive has to do with attracting others, one way or another. If you're talking about a
magnet, that's a literal, physical kind of attraction. For people, being attractive usually means
you're beautiful or handsome enough to pull in the attention of others. But having a great
personality or a good job are attractive traits, too. If someone offered to give you something
valuable for a good price, you could also say, That's an attractive offer Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; meaning
it's tempting.
