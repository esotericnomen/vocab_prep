Only one letter separates the two words, but wishful is having hope for something, and wistful is
having sadness or melancholy about something. Wist isn't even a word that's used anymore, but you
can still be wistful.

People who appear wistful often show a longing for something or a look of serious reflection. One
way to describe the adjective wistful is as the sad appearance of someone looking back and thinking
if only... A thoughtful or pensive mood centered on something good in the past that is missed or
something not so good in the present that could have been better if only something had gone
differently Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; these things make for a wistful outlook.
