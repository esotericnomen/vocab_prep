The next time you have a cut or an infection, maybe you should put some cereal on it. A poultice is
a soft material — often cereal-like — used for healing. Think of a poultice as a mushy, sticky
bandage.

If you have a wound, infection, rash, or inflammation, you will probably cover it with a bandage or
apply medicine to it: a poultice may accomplish both at once. Used in many cultures, a poultice may
be mixed with medicine or heated. It can be made of clay, porridge, or even bread! Not surprisingly,
the word poultice can be traced to the Latin route puls, meaning “porridge” or a warm cereal.
