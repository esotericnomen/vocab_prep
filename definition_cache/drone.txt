A drone is a male bee whose only job — and only purpose in life — is to fertilize the queen
bee's eggs. That's why some workers who do their jobs robotically, not trying to innovate but just
get through each day, are sometimes, and negatively, called drones.

Drone can be a noun and a verb: it is both a low, monotonous sound, like the drone of a boring
teacher that makes students struggle to stay awake, and the act of making that sound — that
teacher drones on and on, never noticing that everyone is staring out the window. Drone can also
refer to a worker whose low level of ambition suggests he or she will never rise through the ranks
to become a top decision-maker at the company.
