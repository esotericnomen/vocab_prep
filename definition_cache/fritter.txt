A person who fritters chooses to spend their energy on things that are wasteful. You can fritter
money, time, or energy, but once you've frittered it away, you can't get it back!

The first time you get a paycheck, you might be tempted to go on a spending spree, buying fireworks,
a rabbit costume, and a giant gumball machine. But be careful, because if you fritter away your
hard-earned cash like that, you won’t have any left for important things, like food and rent. The
Old English root of the word means “break into fragments,” which is what happens to someone who
fritters their life away.
