When you wrestle with something — literally or figuratively — you grapple with it, or try to
overcome it.

If you trace the word grapple back to its French roots, you’ll discover that the word originally
referred to a grape hook, a pronged tool used to harvest grapes. If you think about how awkward it
would be to harvest grapes, with the individual grapes ready to scatter everywhere, it makes sense
that grapple eventually evolved to include a verb form used to describe struggling with something
unruly. You might grapple with a budget shortfall, grapple for answers, grapple with a wrestling
opponent, or grapple with a new technology.
