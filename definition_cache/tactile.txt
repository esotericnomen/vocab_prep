Anything to do with touch can be described as tactile. Even notice how a dog would rather sleep on a
soft blanket than a rubbery leather couch? That's because dogs have tactile preferences: the softer
the better. Different textures of food are tactile â&euro;&rdquo; they feel different in your
mouth, aside from how they taste. You deal with the world of tactile things every day
â&euro;&rdquo; you use your tactile sense whenever you touch anything.
