A stratum is a layer of something, whether abstract, like a social stratum composed of only
billionaires, or physical, like the different strata (thatâ€™s the plural version) of clouds that an
airplane passes through.

Stratum comes from the Latin meaning something that has been laid down, like asphalt or a bedsheet,
but we generally use it to describe layers of something. If you go into geology, you will probably
investigate different strata of the soil. If you start out in life poor and try to become rich, you
are trying to get into a different social stratum.
