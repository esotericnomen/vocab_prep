Something that is fallow is left unused. If you’re smart but lazy, someone might say you have a
fallow mind.

We use the word to talk about any unused resource, it started as a work about land. Fallow comes
from the old English word for plowing, and refers to the practice of leaving fields unplowed in
rotation––when a field lies fallow, the soil regains nutrients that are sucked up by over-
planting.
