Stopping for a snack may help when your energy or attention begin to flag, meaning you are getting
tired or losing your focus.

Flag describes a personâ&euro;&trade;s waning energy level after a sustained effort. For example,
you may begin to flag after a long afternoon sightseeing in a strange city. It can also be used to
describe diminishing success, such as a movie career that seems to flag after the actor stops
landing big roles, flag can also refer to something that seems to drop off, like gym attendance that
flags â&euro;&rdquo; along with those New Year's resolutions.
