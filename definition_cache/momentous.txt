Momentous describes an important event or moment in time. It is used for a time of great consequence
or for a major accomplishment, and is almost always reserved for good things. The day Barack Obama
was elected president was a momentous day for America.

When a moment is so great you know you'll never forget it, you have just experienced something
momentous. It can be personal â&euro;&rdquo; perhaps the day you were named prom queen; or
something historic â&euro;&rdquo; like the day Elizabeth was named Queen of England. Momentous and
momentary share the root word moment but momentary describes just one fleeting moment in time. A
momentary occurrence can certainly be momentous, but it's not always the case.
