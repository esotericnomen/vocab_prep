Something with longevity has the ability to last for a long time. While tortoises are not known for
their quickness, their longevity is amazing. Just ask the Hare.

At the root of longevity is the word long. So when you see longevity, think “a long time. In fact,
this word has some serious longevity, since it's been around since the 1600s. Longevity is most
commonly used to describe the length of one’s lifetime, but it can also mean a long duration, such
as one’s longevity working for a certain company for an extended period of time.
