Awe is a feeling of fear that is mixed with respect and wonder. You might gaze at the Grand Canyon
with awe, marveling at its beauty and fearing its depth.

Awe dates back to Middle English, and was borrowed from Old Norse, a Scandinavian language. In
Middle English the word referred to intense fear. The related English word awful originally meant
full of or causing intense fear. And awesome, which originally meant inspiring awe now is used
generally as a synonym for excellent.
