If you don’t get the grade you were hoping for on your paper, you could try to rewrite it, or you
could meet with your teacher and supplicate. Your humble requests for an ‘A’ may or may not
work.

This verb is derived from the Latin supplicare, “to kneel.” People often supplicate to God for
help in the form of prayer, or supplicate to a judge for a lesser sentence. It is usually an earnest
petition made to an authority figure and can be perfectly respectable or can be somewhat pitiful,
like begging.
