You can describe someone who lacks courage as pusillanimous, such as a pusillanimous student who is
too afraid to speak out against someone who is bullying others.

Its Latin origin — pusillus and animus — tells us that pusillanimous means very small spirit. If
you are pusillanimous, pronounced pew-sill-AN-ih-mus, you don't have the spirit — or the
confidence or drive — to step up when it matters. The pusillanimous person stays quiet, doesn't
get involved, waits for someone else to take a stand — not out of laziness, but out of fear.
