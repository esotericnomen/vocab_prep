When a young person shows respect and obedience to an older person, they’re being deferential to
the elder’s wisdom and experience.

To be obedient, courteous, or dutiful are all ways of being deferential. Bowing low to the Queen is
a deferential act when visiting Buckingham Palace. On sports teams, rookies are usually deferential
to the veterans and star players, while all players should be deferential to the coach. All
employees are expected to be at least a little deferential to their bosses. Being deferential shows
respect, but also means I know my place, and it's lower than yours.
