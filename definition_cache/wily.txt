Did you fall for that wily door to door salesman's pitch?  He must be very slick and tricky to have
convinced you to buy a set of new tires, considering you don't have a car.

How can you remember the meaning of the adjective wily? Just think about the old Warner Brothers
Looney Tunes cartoons. Their aptly named cartoon character, Wile E. Coyote, got his name from a
clever play on words. Wile E. is supposed to be cunning, crafty, and clever Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; in other
words, wily. Wile E. is all those things, but unfortunately he was usually bested by that pesky
roadrunner anyway. Meep. Meep.
