If something has an energetic style or vitality, you can say it has verve. Dancers are noted for
their verve on the stage. Morticians? Not so much.

Similar words to verve include vim, vigor, and ĂŠlan. Verve comes from the Latin root word verba,
meaning words, and in English originally meant a special talent in writing. Although the special
talent sense is now archaic, verve is still an excellent choice to describe a writing style.
