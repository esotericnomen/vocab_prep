Anything wholesome is good for you. Hopscotch is in most cases a wholesome game, since you can't get
into much trouble while hopping up and down on the concrete.

Wholesome foods are the ones that your body appreciates, the ones that help you stay healthy.
Marshmallows and corn chips aren't what you'd call wholesome, but organically grown fruits and
vegetables are. Wholesome can also apply to other things. If you project a wholesome image, other
people see you as a decent, moral person, somebody who's trustworthy and not living a secret life of
crime. The word wholesome comes from the Old English hal, meaning healthy.
