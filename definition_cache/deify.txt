When you deify someone, you're paying the highest compliment: you're treating them like a god.

Maybe it's because people like to exaggerate, but we deify all the time. We deify the latest sports
stars, singers, and actors. When politicians are popular, we deify them. Great writers and artists
of the past â&euro;&rdquo; like Shakespeare and Picasso â&euro;&rdquo; are deified. Anytime we
make someone seem so great, so powerful, so wonderful, and so amazing that it can't possibly be
true, we're deifying them. It's something we just can't help doing when we respect or love someone a
lot.
