Courageous, dauntless, perhaps a little bit daring, a person who is brave faces dangerous or
difficult situations with courage.

The adjective brave can be used to describe anyone or anything that displays courage, such as a
brave firefighter, a brave guide dog, or even brave holiday shoppers. In addition to its adjective
form, the word brave can also act as a verb. Use the verb brave when you want to say that someone is
facing a dangerous or unpleasant situation courageously: “Only the hardiest skiers were able to
brave the icy conditions and complete the course.” Both adjective and verb forms of the word share
a common meaning — the sense of having courage or acting fearlessly.
