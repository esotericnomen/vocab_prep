To sear something is to quickly cook or burn its surface by applying intense heat. When making beef
stew, the color and flavor are usually better if you sear the meat first.

Sear comes from the Old English word searian which meant “dry up” or “wither.”  Typically,
the verb sear now refers to burning or scorching something with heat, but if you see the phrase
“wind-seared,” it means that a place — or something left in that place — has been withered
by exposure to the elements. An unpleasant image can be seared into your memory, meaning you can't
forget it.
