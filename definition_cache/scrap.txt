A scrap is a little leftover bit of something. You might jot down notes on a scrap of paper, or you
might toss a scrap of food to your happy dog.

A scrap is typically a small item that originally was part of something larger, like a scrap of
fabric that was once part of a larger piece. Scrap can also describe something thatâ&euro;&trade;s
no longer useful. For example, you might take scrap metal to the recycling center. Scrap also has a
verb form that means discard. When you scrap your plan to move to the Bahamas, that means
youâ&euro;&trade;re abandoning the plan.
