A garnish is a decoration or embellishment, often used with food. It is also the verb that means to
do the decorating: you can garnish a baked fish with a garnish of lemon slices and parsley.

Long ago, in 14th-century France, the word garnir meant, in part, to warn or defend, a meaning that
survived in one of the meanings of garnish, to seize wages to pay a debt. But word meanings often
branch out, and to warn came to mean to arm oneself, and later to fit out or equip. It came to mean
to embellish in Middle English, and, from the late 17th century on, the word was used commonly for
the embellishment or decoration of food.
