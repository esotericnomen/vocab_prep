Use the adjective ingrained to describe the strong beliefs of someone who has thought that way for a
very long time, such as the ingrained patriotism of a 20-year military veteran.

Ingrained comes from the word grain, which in late Middle English referred to a certain kind of dye.
This type of dye was indelible â&euro;&rdquo; unable to be removed â&euro;&rdquo; much like
ingrained beliefs that are so firmly fixed that they'll never change.
