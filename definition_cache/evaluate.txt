When you evaluate something, you're making a judgment, one that most likely results from some degree
of analysis.

Breaking down the nutritional pros and cons of dessert options is evaluating. Diving into a tub of
Ben and Jerry's because you have a craving is not.    The word evaluate was used as a mathematics
term before it became part of standard usage. Thus, its wonky connotation of objectivity.
