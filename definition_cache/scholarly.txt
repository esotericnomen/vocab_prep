working on a research paper or reading a huge book as scholarly.

Use the adjective scholarly when you talk about a person who is focused on learning Ã¢&euro;&rdquo;
in other words, a scholar. You can also describe things that relate to studying or knowledge as
scholarly, like a scholarly article in a journal or a scholarly atmosphere in a library. The Old
English word scolere, or student, is the root of both scholar and scholarly, from the Latin word for
school, schola.
