Draft means to draw, both in the sense of sketching an image onto paper, but also in terms of
pulling––a draft horse draws or pulls a wagon, a draft of beer is drawn through the spigot on a
keg.

A cold draft is a current of cold air being drawn indoors. To draft someone into the army means to
draw them into service, or make them serve. When you are drafting, or writing, a draft of a paper on
the military draft in the US, you want to let your ideas flow freely. Then, in your next draft, you
can work on filling in holes and edit the language down to what you really want to say.
