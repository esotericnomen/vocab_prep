A rustle can be the dry sounds made by papers rubbing together or leaves crackling. It can also be
the act of searching, stealing, finding food, or making rustle sounds.

Rustle has a whole lotta meanings! Walking home late at night, you hear a rustle behind you. Maybe
it’s just leaves, but you’re spooked, so you rustle around in your knapsack, searching for a
weapon. You turn, and it’s just a hungry friend, so you bring him home and rustle up some food
from your cupboards. As your friend leaves, he rustles all your cows and takes them away.
