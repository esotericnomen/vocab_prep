You can filch money, time, and stuff, but I wouldn't recommend it. Filching is stealing, as in You
filched my cookies!

Doesn't filch just sound kind of dirty? That could be because it's one letter away from filth, but
it's also true that stealing is usually considered a dirty, lowdown deed. No one wants their things
to be filched. Filching is similar to pilfering, swiping, lifting, and purloining Ã¢&euro;&rdquo;
other words for taking what isn't yours. We've all probably filched at some point, but thieves make
a profession out of filching.
