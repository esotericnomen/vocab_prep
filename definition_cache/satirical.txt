If you know the movie you are about to see is satirical, you expect it to make fun some aspect of
human nature or even our society, like a satirical take on the glamorous world of fashion that
portrays all the designers as celebrity-obsessed and unconcerned with true artistry.

Satirical is an adjective that describes satire, a work that is intended to ridicule the
shortcomings and antics of a person or group. So, something that is satirical often looks like the
real thing in order to make fun of it. For example, a sketch on a comedy show in which a comedian
sits behind a news anchor desk and uses a serious tone to report on absurd events that really
happened takes a satirical approach to both the events and the concept of broadcast journalism.
