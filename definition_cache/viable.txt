When something is viable, the adjective refers to something workable with the ability to grow and
function properly.

The adjective viable refers to something able to function properly and even grow. It is made up of
the Latin roots vita which means life, and the ending -able which means to be possible. In terms of
science or botany, when a plant is viable it can live and flourish in an environment such as a
cactus in the desert. Consider also the Wright brothers, who were the first to develop a viable
airplane after many tries and spectacular failures.
