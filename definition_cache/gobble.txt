To gobble is to eat quickly — really quickly. When you gobble your dinner, you hardly even chew
your food.

You’ve probably been told that gobbling your food is impolite. However, maybe you can get away
with it if you impress your dining companions with some interesting facts about this word’s
history. Gobble comes from an Old French word meaning “a mouthful” or “a lump.” It’s
related to gob, a slang term for “mouth” in the UK.
