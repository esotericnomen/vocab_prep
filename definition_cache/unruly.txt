Unruly means lacking in restraint or not submitting to authority. Spitballs, shouting kids, a
shouting teacher––these are all signs of an unruly classroom. Often, one unruly student is all
it takes.

It's easy to see how un- not and ruly rule create a word that is all about not following rules. An
unruly person refuses to obey authority, while an unruly piece of hair might refuse to stay inside a
clip.
