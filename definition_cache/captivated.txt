A person who's captivated is entranced or absorbed by something. A captivated child might stare with
wonder at a tiny ladybug for many long minutes.

Use the adjective captivated to describe someone who is utterly charmed by something. A captivated
student is enthralled by her teacher's history lesson, and a captivated audience is involved in
every word spoken on stage during a play. The word is rooted in the Late Latin captivare, to take or
capture, which in turn comes from capere, to seize. When something seizes your attention, you are
captivated.
