Fortitude refers to strength in the face of adversity or difficulty. Eating fried worms might
require a lot of intestinal fortitude.

When someone has fortitude it means that they have emotional power or reserves and the ability to
withstand adversity. People who have fortitude are described in an admiring way for their courage
and this word comes from the Latin word fortitudo, meaning strength. Jacueline Bisset, someone who
knows about beauty, said, Character contributes to beauty. It fortifies a woman as her youth fades.
A mode of conduct, a standard of courage, discipline, fortitude and integrity can do a great deal to
make a woman beautiful.
