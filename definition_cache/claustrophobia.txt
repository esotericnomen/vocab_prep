Claustrophobia is an irrational or abnormal fear of being in an enclosed space.  If your heart races
in an elevator, or you break out in a cold sweat in a walk-in closet, you might have claustrophobia.

Claustrophobia is made of ancient Latin words.  Phobia  means fear, and  claustro  means bolt —
the kind you put on a door. Broadly speaking, the opposite of claustrophobia is agoraphobia, which
is the fear of open spaces. For fun, try adding -phobia to your own personal source of dread! For
example, “math-phobia.”
