A star twinkles in the night sky. To put it more scientifically, it’s a celestial body of hot
gases radiating energy. A star is also a person who dazzles — the star of the show or the star
archaeologist.

If you're starring in a Broadway show, your name gets top billing — you've got the biggest part or
maybe you're the best known performer, the actor people are wild to see, the one with the most star
power. If you believe in fate or astrology, you might thank your lucky stars for your good fortune.
Star is the same root as the Greek aster, as in asterisk — a star symbol.
