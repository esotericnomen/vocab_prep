Frolicking in a huge field of flowers might sound like a great time. But if you suffer from
agoraphobia it would be terrifying because you would be afraid of open spaces.

In a world with so many fears, there’s a phobia for every occasion.  Agoraphobia is the fear of
wide open spaces.  The Greek root agora means “public open space” and “marketplace,” so
agoraphobia is also the fear of crowds, like the kind you’d find in a busy supermarket.  Like all
phobias, agoraphobia can make someone panic and freak out, so if you see a person experiencing
agoraphobia, maybe put them inside a closet and see if that helps.
