If you're talking about a typical example of something, call it the epitome. The cartoon character
Garfield is the epitome of the fat, lazy, food-obsessed cat.

Coming to us from Greek through Latin, epitome refers to something that is the ultimate
representative of its class. Are you the epitome of the hard-working student or do you believe in
study in moderation? Make sure you pronounce epitome with the accent on the second syllable (uh-PIH-
tuh-mee).
