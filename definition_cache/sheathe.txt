The verb sheathe means to place in a sheath. What's a sheath? Well, that's any kind of protective
covering.

With that extra e on the end sheathe gives off a very old English vibe. Perhaps that's because all
those knights were often sheathing their swords so as not to scare the fair ladies. Those knights
were also sheathed in armor when going into battle or setting off to joust. These days, with
medieval armaments in low demand, not much gets sheathed Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; except maybe the kitchen
knives in the knife block or your cat's claws when they retract.
