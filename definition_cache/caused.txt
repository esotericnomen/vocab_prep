A cause is what makes something happen but it can also be the act of making something happen, like
when spending time on a crystal-clear vocabulary website causes you to understand words better.

A cause makes an effect, and you're likely to hear the phrase, cause and effect, when people are
trying to analyze how things happen.  Cause can also mean something a person or group wants to make
happen. You might raise money for a good cause, like ending poverty.  Once the doctor determines the
cause of your illness, she might make it her personal cause to discover a cure.  If you're feeling
healthy, don't let the last sentence cause you any concern.
