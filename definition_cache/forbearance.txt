When a teacher says, Bear with me for a moment, while he writes on the board, he is asking for the
class's forbearance. He wants them to wait patiently during the delay.

Forbearance also has a more technical, legal meaning Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; if you are owed money and you
give someone extra time to get it to you, you're showing them forbearance. The word has nothing to
do with actual bears, but if you think of one slumbering through its winter hibernation, that might
help remember its meaning.
