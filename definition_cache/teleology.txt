A philosophy of teleology sees purpose in ends rather than stated causes, making the outcome the
actual, or final cause.  When you see things in terms of teleology, you explain actions by their
results.

We can trace the origin of teleology to the Greeks: to teleos, meaning complete, and its  root
telos, meaning result. Then we add the suffix -logy, which means logic, or reason. The philosophy
itself suggests that acts are done with a foregone purpose in mind Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; people do things
knowing the result they wish to achieve. As Aristotle said, Nature does nothing in vain.  So far,
there's no teleology to explain why you haven't left the couch for several hours.
