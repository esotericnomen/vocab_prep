Resumption is what you're doing when you resume, or start from the point where you left off. If your
little sister has been bothering you, then goes out to play, you can expect peace for an hour, then
a resumption of the annoyance when she returns.

Like the word resume, resumption has roots in the Latin prefix re- meaning again and sumere meaning
to take up. Combine these two root words: to take up again and you get the meaning of the word. If
warring nations stop fighting in an attempt to negotiate a peace settlement, you can expect a
resumption of hostilities between them if the negotiations fail.
