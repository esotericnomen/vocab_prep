If your only cavil to your family's trip to Disney World is that you don't like airline food, you're
not representing the anti-Mickey side of the argument very well. A cavil is a small or petty
objection.

Cavil is not a word that comes up all that often. You can replace it with the more commonly used
word  quibble and still have the same meaning. If you cavil over a restaurant bill, you argue about
the minute, unimportant details of who owes what â&euro;&ldquo;â&euro;&ldquo; like whether your
portion of the bill is $10.00 or $10.50.
