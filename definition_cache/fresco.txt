Whether you've studied art history or not, you're probably familiar with the world's most famous
fresco: Michelangelo's paintings on the walls and ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in Rome.

To paint a fresco, you must apply paint to still wet plaster, and you better get it right the first
time. Too slow and the plaster hardens, and then you've got a lot of chipping away to do. Fresco
comes from the Italian fresco, meaning cool or fresh, which describes exactly the fast, unlabored
technique required of fresco painting.
