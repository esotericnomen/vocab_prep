Do you have a friend who constantly turns the conversation to themselves, as in That's great about
your winning the award but do you think these pants look good on me? They're putting their
narcissism, or excessive love of self, on display.

In psychoanalysis, narcissism is erotic gratification derived from excessive love for yourself, and
is considered to be a normal developmental stage. The reference is to Narcissus, a beautiful youth
in Greek mythology who fell in love with his reflection in a body of water and was changed into the
flower narcissus, which grows near water.
