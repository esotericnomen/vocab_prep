You might be tempted to turn the radio dial when you hear a love song that is saccharine, meaning
that it’s too sweet and sentimental to bear.

The adjective saccharine comes from the Middle Latin word for sugar. Saccharine is a type of sugar
substitute that you might sprinkle on your cereal or berries to sweeten them without the calories of
real sugar. The word is used to describe something so sweet that it’s annoying — like a very
sentimental song or a tear-jerking commercial.
