If you're torn between going to your best friend's birthday party and racing go-carts with your
sister, you're experiencing indecision, or difficulty making up your mind.

Whenever there are at least two great choices, you're sure to feel at least a little indecision. Too
many options at the grocery story can cause indecision, as can choosing a college major or picking
just one friend to take with you to Disney World. Any time you waver or hesitate between
possibilities, it's evidence of your indecision.
