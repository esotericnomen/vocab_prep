A dynamo creates energy. It’s short for dynamoelectric machine, which is a generator that cranks
out electric currents. If someone calls you a dynamo, don’t get mad, it just means you’re
energetic.

The word dynamo comes from the Greek dynamis for power. Boom! It’s like dynamite! The inventor of
the dynamo-electric machine knew that when he named the device that turns mechanical power into
electric current. Dynamos have been used to make power since the 1800’s. Since dynamo is such a
snappy name, it’s often used to describe high-energy people, too. Is your room a disaster? Call an
organizing dynamo to help you clean it up.
