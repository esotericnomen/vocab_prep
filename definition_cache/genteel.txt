Although the adjective genteel means high-class and refined, it is often used today in a somewhat
mocking tone, as though good manners and elegance are passé. Still, it would be nice if more people
were a little more genteel.

The word genteel comes from the Old French word gentil, high-born, noble. We can see the similarity
to the word gentle, as in gentleman and gentlewoman. The word is especially powerful in describing
Chaucer's Knight in the Canterbury Tales as a verray, parfit gentil knyght — a true, perfect,
noble knight, dignified, patrician, and as genteel as they come. Today, it describes someone
elegant, fashionable, and well-bred. Picture someone in riding jodhpurs reading Town and Country
while astride a magnificent show horse.
