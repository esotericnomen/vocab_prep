What do love, money, and the earth all have in common? All can dwindle, or shrink away, if we don't
handle them properly.

The word dwindle has a wonderfully descriptive, almost childlike sound to it, as though it belongs
in a nursery rhyme. That might help you remember the meaning, which is to shrink away gradually,
like the Cheshire Cat in Alice in Wonderland, who dwindles away until nothing is left but his grin.
