Use the noun prudence to describe sensible decisions about everyday life, like the prudence of
people who spend their money wisely, saving as much as they can.

Prudence can also describe the skill of side-stepping trouble or embarrassment, like having the
prudence to avoid risks or the prudence to prepare for the unexpected, like packing a change of
clothes in case the weather changes or your dinner reservations turn out to be at a fancy
restaurant. Prudence comes from the Latin word prudentia, which means foresight, sagacity.
