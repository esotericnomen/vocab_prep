To deplete is to use up or consume a limited resource. Visiting relatives might deplete your
refrigerator of food, or a pestering friend might deplete your patience.

The verb deplete is used like “to drain.” A long, exhausting day can deplete your body of energy
and a summer drought can deplete a region’s water supply. If you deplete your body of hydration
after a lot of exercise, be sure to replete yourself with a nice glass of water.
