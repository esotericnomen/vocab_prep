When you swallow food or liquid is pushed from your mouth to the esophagus. Chew your food well
before you swallow it.

As a verb, swallow means to enclose or envelop completely, like quicksand that swallows everything
that falls into it. Swallow can also mean to stop from expressing, like when you swallow your pride
and ask for help. The noun swallow describes a gulp, though you don't always do it for digestion;
sometimes a few swallows of air help you keep from crying. A swallow is also a type of small
songbird.
