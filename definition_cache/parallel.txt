In math, parallel means two lines that never intersect––think of an equals sign. Figuratively,
parallel means similar, or happening at the same time. A story might describe the parallel lives of
three close friends.

Parallel is from Greek parallēlos, from the prefix para- beside plus allēlōn of one another, from
allos other. As a noun, a parallel is a way in which things resemble each other––you might draw
parallels between the Vietnam War and the US invasion of Iraq. In specialized use, a parallel can
mean one of the imaginary circles on the surface of the Earth that are parallel to the
equator––the 49th parallel divides the US and Canada.
