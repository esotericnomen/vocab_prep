When you conspire, you collaborate with others to do harm, or maybe just keep something from
happening, like a group that conspires to get tuna melts booted from the lunch menu by urging
everyone to order other things.

You can conspire with someone, meaning you team up with another person to plot against someone else,
or you can conspire against someone. This means you devise a scheme to do that person harm. Conspire
also can be used in a more figurative sense to describe events that cause problems, like bad weather
that may conspire against your picnic plans, or a series of injuries that conspire against a
basketball team struggling to make the playoffs.
