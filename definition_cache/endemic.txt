If you want to underscore just how commonly found and present something is within a particular
place, try the word endemic. Tight pants are endemic in my lunch room!

Although endemic meaning prevalent often describes a plant or disease, it can also refer to
something less tangible and more unwanted such as violence or poverty. Many complain of endemic
corruption in the local government. Despite its -ic ending, endemic can also be used as a noun to
signify a plant or animal that is prevalent in a certain region. If an endemic is brought to another
area which it takes over, destroying the local population, it's classified as an invasive species.
And researchers have cataloged several new African endemics.
