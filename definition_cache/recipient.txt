A recipient is the person on the receiving end of something. Meryl Streep is the recipient of more
Academy Award nominations than any other actor.

Just as an actor can be the recipient of a prize for acting, a banker can be the recipient of a
bonus for good banking. You'll notice the connection between recipient and receive. In order to be a
recipient you have to receive something, whether it's a prize or just a letter in the mail.    If
it's true that it's better to give than to receive, does that mean it's better to be a giver than a
recipient?
