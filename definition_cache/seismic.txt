For the ancient Greeks, seismos meant an earthquake. Later on, when the study of earthquakes became
a science, anything seismic meant anything related to the study of the pressures in the Earth's
crust.

The English language has a long and proud tradition of stealing scientific words and applying them
in all sorts of ways that scientists probably wish they didn't: Darwinian, tempestuous, evolutionary
Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; to name but three. It's the same with seismic, which is now far more likely to be
applied to political or psychological turmoil than anything to do with the earth opening up and
molten hot lava spewing out.
