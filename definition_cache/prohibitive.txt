If something's so expensive you can't touch it, it's prohibitive. That Ferrari in the showroom? You
may want it, but its price is prohibitive.

Prohibitive originally referred to something (often a law) that prohibits or forbids something, but
came to mean conditions (often prices or taxes) so high or great they restrict or prevent something:
To some, the cost of child care is prohibitive. The stress is on the second syllable, just like the
verb: pro-HIB-itive. If it's a matter of expense, a synonym is exorbitant.
