Values are the beliefs of a social group. These are often very strongly held beliefs and they are
often for something or against it.

It's no surprise that the word values comes from a word that means to be worth something: People
often view their values as so precious that they'd be willing to fight for them. Sometimes they do
fight for them. The core values of a company or organization, while maybe not exactly worth fighting
for, do, however, represent what that organization believes in and believes its mission to be.
