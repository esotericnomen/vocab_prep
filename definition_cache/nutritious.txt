Nutritious describes food that's good for you. Brown rice and kale are nutritious, but jelly beans,
sadly, are not.

Something that provides nutrients â&euro;&rdquo; vitamins, minerals, and protein, for example
â&euro;&rdquo; is nutritious. Our bodies need nutritious food to grow, heal, and stay healthy,
however much we might crave tasty, non-nutritious snacks. The adjective nutritious comes from the
Latin word nutritius, that nourishes, which in turn comes from the root nutrix, nurse.
