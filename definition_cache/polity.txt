The noun polity refers to a political group of any size or shape â€” it can be a government, a
state, a country, or even a social group.

When you hear the word polity, think politics and you're on the right track. The prefix for polity
dates all the way back to Greece, from the word politeia, which means citizenship or government. Any
group run by politics can be called a polity. The Democratic Party is a polity, but hopefully your
birthday party isn't.
