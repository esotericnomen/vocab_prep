If this were Medieval Europe, you would probably be a vassal — like most everyone else. Vassals
were people who worked the vast plots of land that were held by lords, who though much fewer in
number, held all the wealth and power.

In days of yore, vassals pledged devotion to feudal lords, who were the landowners, in exchange for
protection and use of the land—-called a fief. Use vassal when referring to a servant, or anyone
wholly dependent on another, or to describe a place that is controlled by one that is more powerful.
For example, during World War II, Poland was a vassal of Germany.
