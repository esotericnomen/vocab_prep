Gruff is an abrupt or forbidding tone. It's the kind of short, brusque response you'd give a
telemarketer who called you in the middle of dinner â€” right before you hung up.

Gruff is the perfect adjective to describe a crotchety old man who rarely leaves his house and yells
at any children who dare to cross his lawn. You can almost imagine the rough tone of his voice as he
points his cane at those pesky trespassers, his deep, terrifying bark, causing all the children on
his lawn to immediately scatter.
