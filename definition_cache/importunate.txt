You know those people, who are so focused on what they want, that even when it is reasonable, their
asking for it over and over gets really annoying? They, and their questions, can be called
importunate.

Importunate rhymes with unfortunate and importunate questions, in their annoying persistence, are
unfortunate indeed. You'll see in importunate the Latin root port, which means harbor. An opportune
wind helps you get into port safely; an importune one, unfortunately, doesn't.
