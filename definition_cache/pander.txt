If a campaigning politician wants to pander to a crowd of pet owners, he might deliver a speech
while embracing his own pet poodle. To pander is to appease or gratify, and often in a negative,
self-serving way.

The word pander began its infamous history as the name of various characters. Pandaro was a
character in Boccaccio’s Filostrato. Pandarus was a character in Chaucer’s Troilus and Criseyde,
as well as in Shakespeare’s Troilus and Cressida. These literary works all tell the tale of star-
crossed lovers, and the namesake of pander is, essentially, a go-between whose motives don't seem
entirely pure.
