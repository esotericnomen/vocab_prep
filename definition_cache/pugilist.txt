Pugilist is a fancy word for boxer, one who indulges in the noble art of pugilism, or fighting with
one's fists.

Be warned when people use the term pugilist or you see it in the paper. Nowadays such a term is
often sarcastic in tone and critical of boxing's claims for legitimacy, often suggesting it's
essentially savagery masquerading as  sport. If you hear the term fighter you can be more certain
it's used with approval, or at least without prejudice.
