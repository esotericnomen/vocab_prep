When one thing precedes another, it comes before. You put your socks on before your shoes, you close
the door before you lock it, and you should make sure the store is open before you leave home.

The word before comes from the Old English beforan, meaning “in front of” or “in former
times.” Before tells when something happens — don’t hire that guy before you check his
references — or the position of something: the library is the last building before the
intersection. In before and after pictures, the before ones were taken prior to the makeover,
renovation, and so on, while the after photos show the improvement.
