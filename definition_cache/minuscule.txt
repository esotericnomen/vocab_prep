When something is teeny tiny, it is minuscule. If your mother calls your miniskirt minuscule, it
probably means she wants you to change into something a bit less revealing.

In minuscule, you see the word, minus, which means lesser. The word minuscule has its roots in the
Latin expression minuscula littera, a phrase used to describe the smaller letters in text. In the
late 1800s, the use of the word expanded to mean very small in general â&euro;&rdquo; so the
definition of minuscule became less minuscule.
