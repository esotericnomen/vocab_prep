Let's say you have a secret. You've promised not to tell, but there's something forcing you to call
a friend and spill the beans. This force is compulsion, that urge to do something even though you
know you shouldn't.

If you go back to the Latin, you find compulsus, the past participle of the verb compellere, to
compel. You can see the connection with our word compulsion, which means something compelling.  The
word gained a more psychological meaning in 1909 in a translation of Freud√¢&euro;&trade;s studies,
suggesting a type of neurosis that impels a person to do things in an obsessive manner.
