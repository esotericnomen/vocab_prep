Omnipresent describes something that's everywhere at once, like a deity or a bad smell.

You might recognize the prefix omni-, meaning all, from words like omnipotence (all powerful), or
omniscient (all knowing). Add it to -present, and voilĂ , there's something that's present all the
time, like Santa Claus who sees you when you're sleeping and knows when you're awake. You can't hide
from an omnipresent being. Hair splitters prefer that a bad smell be ubiquitous (turns up
everywhere) and save omnipresent for the divine. And Santa.
