Fervid can be used to describe something that is physically hot such as “a fervid day in
August,” but it is more often used to describe heated emotions like anger, love, or desire.

When passions and emotions run wild, you should expect to hear some fervid language thrown about.
The adjective fervid comes from the Latin fervidus which means “glowing, burning, or boiling.”
It is often used like the word fiery. You might hear a politician deliver a “fervid speech” if
he or she is particularly worked up over an issue.
