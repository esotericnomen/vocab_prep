Entail means what something involves. The job entailed us standing in the snow for hours dressed as
giant, human hot dogs. It entailed far too much humiliation to justify the $3.55 an hour we were
paid.

The word entail is connected to the idea of preconditions. If you want something, you better figure
out what it entails. If we want to see the movie at 9 o'clock, that will entail us waiting in the
lobby another hour. If we want to stay out of trouble with our moms, that will entail us calling
them and letting them know we're going to be later than we said.
