Use the verb disembark to describe leaving a ship, airplane or other type of vehicle, like making
sure you haven't left anything in the plane's overhead compartment before you disembark.

Embark means putting passengers in a plane or on a boat.  Disembark is its opposite. When you
disembark, you leave a ship or a plane, like when you can't wait to disembark at the port in order
to go sight-seeing. When you disembark, there is a transition â&euro;&rdquo; you walk down a
gangplank to go from water to land or down a special corridor to get from the runway to the airport
terminal â&euro;&rdquo; unlike when you get out of a car. That's why you wouldn't use disembark for
getting out of a car.
