Here comes someone who only ever talks to you when he needs a favor.  Quick, parry!  When you parry,
you avoid doing things. As the needy friend approaches, say, I wish I had time to catch up! and
hurry off. Or, hide under a table.

The word parry is often used to describe blocking or evading a movement, like parrying a punch, but
it can also refer to an evasion that is verbal rather than physical. For example, if you are put on
the spot and asked about something youâ&euro;&trade;d rather avoid, you can parry to get out of it
â&euro;&rdquo; change the subject or ask a question in return. When used in this way parry retains
its sense of defending yourself through evasion.
