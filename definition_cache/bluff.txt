Bluff can mean a high cliff, or it can describe a person who is abrupt in manner, but the most
common association is someone pretending to something they're not. If you bluff at cards, you are
pretending to have a better hand than you do.

Many a good crime story ends with a bluff√¢&euro;&rdquo;I've already contacted the police and
they're on their way, the detective will say when that is not at all the case. The expression
calling your bluff comes from poker, where you call a game to see someone's actual cards. Calling
someone's bluff means forcing them to admit the truth.
