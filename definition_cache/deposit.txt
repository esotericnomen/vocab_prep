You are making a deposit when you put money into your bank account. In that sentence, deposit is a
noun, but you could express the same action using deposit as a verb. You deposit money into your
bank account.

The verb deposit can be used to refer to anything that you put down or in place. If you're carrying
your keys and groceries from the car, you may deposit those items on the counter. Just be careful
you don't end up playing where are my keys in the morning, if the counter is not your usual place
for depositing them. You can also use deposit when nature does the placing. You find a deposit of
gold in the mountain rock or there is sediment deposited at the bottom of a river.
