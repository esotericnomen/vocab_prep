Censure is a noun referring to very strong criticism; the verb means to criticize very strongly. If
you take your dad's car without telling him, you can expect him to censure you severely, and maybe
even ground you as well.

The noun and verb are most closely associated with official expressions of disapproval, as when
Congress censures a senator. The noun is from Latin cēnsūra censorship, from cēnsor an ancient
Roman censor. The job of a Roman censor was to take the census and to supervise public morals and
behavior. Our English word censor––which means to suppress speech or other forms of
expression––is from this Latin word.
