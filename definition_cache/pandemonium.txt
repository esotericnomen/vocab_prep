Pandemonium is chaos, total and utter craziness — like the stampede after your team won the
championship, when everyone spilled onto the field at once, bouncing off each other.

If you look carefully at the word pandemonium, you’ll see the word demon inside it. This makes
sense, since the word pandemonium was coined in Milton’s Paradise Lost, where it was the name of
the palace built in the middle of Hell. Milton wrote back in the 17th century. Nowadays, pandemonium
crops up whenever journalists are describing a chaotic scene. High school students have been heard
to use it to describe their lunchroom.
