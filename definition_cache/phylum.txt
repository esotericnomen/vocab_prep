If someone asks you what you have in common with the Antarctic icefish, you can say that you both
belong to the same phylum, meaning the same taxonomic group.

Biology types are probably already familiar with using the word phylum as a way to classify animals
and plants. Mammals, including humans, are part of the phylum chordata, which also includes fishes,
amphibians, reptiles, and birds. As you can see that√¢&euro;&trade;s a very broad category. Phylum
comes above class and below kingdom in the biological classification system. The ranks get
increasingly narrow, working all the way down to species, which is a closely related group.
