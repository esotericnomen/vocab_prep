Restitution is the act of making up for damages or harm, like the time you knocked the ball out of
the park, scoring a home run but breaking a house's window in the process. You had to make
restitution for the broken window, paying for its replacement.

The noun restitution means both restoring something to its original state and returning something to
its rightful owner, like a public apology that leads to the restitution of a person's honor and
reputation.  Restitution also has a specific legal meaning Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; an order given by a judge
to a convicted criminal to make amends for the crime. For examples, judges often order people to pay
restitution for the damage they cause.
