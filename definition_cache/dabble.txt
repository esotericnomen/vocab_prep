You dabble when you are a little bit involved in an activity, such as an art form or a hobby. Maybe
you only dabble in mystery novels, but you are very knowledgeable about comic books.

The word dabble can also often relate to water. It can mean “to splash playfully,” or “to get
just a little wet.” A bird can also dabble in water by dipping its bill into it. Each of these
meanings of dabble is often followed by the word in. For example, a duck may dabble in the water
(and then dribble a few drops afterward from its bill), and you may dabble in shrubbery art.
