If you resume something, you start it again after stopping. You might resume singing an aria after
breaking to spit out your gum.

Resume is from Latin resumere to take up again, take back, from the prefix re- again plus sumere to
take up, take. The Latin verb sumere is formed from the prefix sub- under, up plus emere to take.
When you pause a movie or game and then you press play again, what you're really doing is resuming
play.
