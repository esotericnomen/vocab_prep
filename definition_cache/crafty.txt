If people call you crafty, they probably mean you are sly and a little deceptive. Then again, they
could be saying that you are really good at knitting, beading or turning old t-shirts into funky
pillowcases.

The adjective crafty comes from the Old English word cræftig, which meant “strong” or
“powerful,” but the meaning of crafty these days has to do with being skilled at getting what
you want through manipulation, deceit and trickery. Dickens’ Artful Dodger, the con-man from
Oliver Twist, is crafty. Handmade items, and sometimes the people who make them, can also be called
crafty, like your crafty sister who always makes you unique birthday gifts.
