If you pine for someone, you desperately want to see them, be with them, or perhaps smother them
with kisses. If you're texting your ex-boyfriend over 50 times a day, there's a pretty good chance
that you still pine for him.

In Old English, pine meant to torture or cause to experience pain, which seems quite fitting if
you've known what it's like to pine for something or someone. The verb pine should not be confused
with the noun pine, as in the evergreen tree. If you are from the Northeast and find yourself living
in the Caribbean, you may pine for the sight of a pine tree, but the lovely weather should ease the
pain.
