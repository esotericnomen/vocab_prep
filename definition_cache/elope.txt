When you elope, you run away with the person you love. Usually, you elope to get married without
anyone knowing in advance.

The word elope probably originated with the Middle Dutch word lopen, meaning run away. Couples who
elope typically don't seek anyone's permission before running off to get married, not even their
parents. Often, that's the whole point of wanting to elope: you can avoid dealing with anyone who
might opt to speak now instead holding their peace.
