When someone says, “I hate to intrude, but…” you can bet she is in fact going to interrupt
your conversation or insert her opinion, even though it isn’t wanted. House burglars also intrude,
but they don’t usually announce it first.

People can intrude in different ways, but it is usually uninvited and also unwelcome. This verb is
derived from the Latin, intrudere, in which the in- means “into” and -trudere means, “to
thrust.” So people can in intrude by thrusting or forcing themselves into your private life, your
personal body space, or your home. Loud music could intrude into your studying.  A memory could
intrude while you are trying to focus on texting a message.
