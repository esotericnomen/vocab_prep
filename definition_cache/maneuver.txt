You maneuver your way through a crowd, a bureaucracy, traffic, or traffic cones. You can maneuver a
car or a piece of machinery. Army maneuvers are highly coordinated movements of troops, supplies and
machinery.

If you're wondering if the opposite of maneuver is woman-euver, wonder no further. It isn't.
Although maneuvering often involves a man on the move, the man- comes from the Latin manus meaning
hand. Maneuver reached English via the French manÄ¹&ldquo;uvre meaning tactical movement -- an
interesting maneuver in its own right.
