The verb paraphrase means to sum something up or clarify a statement by rephrasing it. So to
paraphrase that explanation, it means to say something in other, simpler words.

If you break paraphrase down, you end up with the prefix para, meaning beside, and the word phrase
â&euro;&rdquo; so think of paraphrase as coming up with similar, more simple phrases that go beside
the ones already said. You might paraphrase your teacherâ&euro;&trade;s lesson because you want to
simplify her complicated technical language, or because you forgot exactly what she said but
remember the general meaning.
