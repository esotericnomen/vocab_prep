Litigation is what goes on in court; it is the name for the process of suing someone or trying them
for a crime. When families fight over their inheritance, the assets they want may end up being tied

best option is to bring litigation against him: take him to court! We can use litigation to talk
about one court case, or about cases in general. When the Congress debates health care, they try to
find ways to reduce for medical malpractice litigation, which is one of the most expensive aspects
of medicine.
