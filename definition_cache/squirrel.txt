Squirrels are rodents that live in trees and have big, bushy tails. You've probably seen many
squirrels in the park eating acorns and seeds.

A well-known characteristic of squirrels is gathering nuts and seeds to store for the winter: you
can say they squirrel away that food. You can squirrel things away, too, like squirreling away money
in your savings account to use later. If you find a great sale on snow boots in the middle of
summer, you might take advantage of the bargain and squirrel those boots away for your trip to
northern Canada in January.
