If you don’t think you got a fair share of cake at a birthday party, there might have been a
disproportion in the way the cake was served. A disproportion is a lack of balance or equality.

Disproportion contains the prefix dis- which means “not” or “away from,” and the noun
proportion which means “a proper, equal share.” Therefore, disproportion refers to an unequal
and improper share. This noun is usually used in a negative context to point out something that is
imbalanced or unfair, such as a disproportion of funds, food, or freedoms. Disproportion is also
used in reference to the body; if your feet seem too big, they are in disproportion to your body.
