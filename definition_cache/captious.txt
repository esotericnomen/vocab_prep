If someone tends to be hypercritical and find fault with everything, you can describe that person as
captious. Try not to be described as a captious person yourself, however. No one likes a carping
individual!

Captious comes from the Middle French word captieux, which is from the Latin word captiosus meaning
fallacious or deceiving. This is, in fact, another meaning for the adjective captious, something is
calculated to confuse or deceive Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; such as a captious explanation of the facts. When a
person is described as captious, the sense is usually of nitpicking at faults or raising petty
objections. It is usually used to imply a permanent character or personality flaw, as opposed to a
momentary lapse in understanding.
