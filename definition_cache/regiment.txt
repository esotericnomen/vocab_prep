Use the word regiment to describe a military unit that is smaller than a division: “Geoff’s new
regiment consisted of three battalions that had been based in Alabama.”

Most often used as a noun to describe a military unit made up of several battalions, the word
regiment can also be used as a verb. If you ever need to assign troops to a regiment, you might say
something like, “Next week I will regiment the ground forces arriving from North Dakota.” The
verb form can also be used in a more general sense to describe any action that is characterized by
strict order or control: Her diet is strictly regimented to include only Sugar Babies.
