The verb dismember means to sever the limbs from a body. If you watch a horror movie, one of the
necessary plot elements is for the villain to dismember a body or two... or twelve.

Dismember is from the Latin word dismembrare, which itself is from the Latin roots de, meaning take
away, and membrum, meaning limb. The verb dismember also means to cut up into pieces or take apart.
If you are doing genealogical research on your family tree you may have difficulty if your ancestors
are from a region that was dismembered.  You may know your family was from the Soviet Union, for
example, but since that country was dismembered, you now may need to check records in Uzbekistan or
Azerbaijan to find the branches of your family tree.
