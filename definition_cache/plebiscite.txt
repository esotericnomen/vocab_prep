A plebiscite is a direct vote by eligible voters to decide an important public question, such as a
change to the constitution, secession, or a similar issue of national or regional importance.

The word plebiscite comes from the Latin word plebiscitum, meaning a decree of the people, with the
roots plebs, the common people, and scitum, decree. A plebiscite can also be called a referendum.
Periodically, for example, Quebec separatists hold a plebiscite to determine whether Quebec should
secede from Canada. So far, the secessionists have not prevailed at the polls.
