When you scavenge you pick through discarded things looking for whatever is salvageable and can be
reused. If you're looking for a replacement part for a vintage car, you might scavenge at the dump
for a suitable part.

If you're a freegan you've embraced the idea of trying to live for free, recycling and reusing what
others have discarded, leaving a small footprint on the planet. You’re on the lookout for good
places to scavenge, such as the dumpster behind a busy supermarket, where you might find edible
food, or the trash bins at clothing stores, where wearable clothing is tossed out. Vultures, hyenas,
and other animals that feed on carrion — dead animals — also scavenge.
