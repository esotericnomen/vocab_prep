The noun resort means turning to something or someone else for assistance. You tried everything to
figure out your math homework on your own, so asking your dad for help was your last resort.

Resort, pronounced re-ZORT, is also a verb that means to adopt a course of action to improve your
situation. It's when you use that last resort: if you can't convince your mom to let you go rock-
climbing, you will resort to begging. Resort also means a fancy hotel, usually in a very scenic
location, or a place you go often Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; when your friends didn't know where you were, they
checked your resorts: the gym and the park.
