Libel is the act of publishing a statement about someone that is not true and that gives a bad
impression about the person.

Libel is usually contrasted with slander, which refers to a spoken statement that is not true. Both
libel and slander are used in legal contexts. In Middle English, libel referred to a written
declaration, from Anglo-French, from Latin libellus, from liber book.
