In classical mythology, satyrs were companions to Pan, a fertility god, and Dionysus, the god of
wine and ecstasy. As you might guess, satyrs were not known for their mild-mannered ways: Like their
patrons, they were excessively fond of women, drink, and song.

In Greek art, the satyr was depicted as a man with the ears and tale of a horse. Roman artists
emphasized this creature's relationship to the goat-god Pan by giving the satyr a goat's ears,
horns, and haunches. In both cases, the satyr's animal aspect symbolized his immoderate appetites.
This noun can also be used metaphorically for a man whose sexual desire is stronger than his sense
of decency.
