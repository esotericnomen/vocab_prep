A diverse group is made up of people or things that are very different from each other. If your
class mixes kids from all over the world, you could call it a diverse.

The adjective diversified has the same meaning, and a near synonym is varied. An earlier spelling of
the English adjective was divers, and the final Ã¢&euro;&ldquo;e was probably added by association
with words such as traverse and converse. The word divers is still in use in the sense more than
one, several, various: divers methods and styles.
