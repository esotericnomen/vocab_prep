If you spent the summer building a beautiful stone wall around your backyard, you may have a future
as a mason, someone who builds things out of brick or stone.

Usage experts canâ&euro;&trade;t quite agree on the origins of the word mason. Some believe that it
traces back to the German word mahhon, meaning to make. True or not, itâ&euro;&trade;s a good way
to remember the meaning of mason: masons make things out of brick or stone. A mason is a skilled
craftsperson who might, for example, carve stone for a memorial or do work on the brick walls of a
house.
