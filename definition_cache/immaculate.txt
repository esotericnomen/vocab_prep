Immaculate means spotless, pure, and clean as fresh snow on a far-off mountain. Only obsessive
cleaners can keep immaculate homes, but it’s a goal we can strive for, like that far-off mountain.

Immaculate literally means without a spot or a stain. We can use immaculate to describe physical
things, like bathrooms or kitchens. But we also use the word metaphorically to describe honor or
purity — in the Catholic church, being immaculate means being free from sin, like the Virgin Mary.
Or someone with a pure, exact singing voice could be described as having immaculate pitch. If your
home team plays a perfect game, you could say their performance was immaculate.
