Use the adverb stiffly to describe something that's done in an awkward or rigid way. If you stiffly
introduce yourself to your new neighbor, you're a little inept about it, not very graceful or
smooth.

Something can move stiffly in a physical sense: your grandmother's knees might bend slowly and
stiffly as she eases into a comfortable chair. You can also use stiffly when you're describing
someone who is socially uncomfortable. A very formal little boy might stiffly welcome his guests to
his seventh birthday party, for example. Stiffly comes from the adjective stiff, with its Old
English root of stif, rigid or inflexible.
