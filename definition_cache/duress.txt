Let’s hope you’re never denied food and sleep and forced to sign a confession, but if you are,
that's called being under duress. Threats and harsh treatment meant to make you do something you
don’t want to do is duress.

The word duress came into English through French, with origins in the Latin word duritia, which
means “hardness.” First used to describe harsh or cruel treatment, duress soon took on the
additional meaning of forcing someone to do something, usually through threats. Duress is typically
used with the word under, as in a suspect who only signs a confession because he is under duress.
