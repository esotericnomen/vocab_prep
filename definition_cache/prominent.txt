If you're looking for an adjective that means sticking out above the rest; famous, consider
prominent. A prominent person might be the big cheese, the head honcho, the top dog â€” not just any
Joe Schmo.

A prominence is anything that juts out, like a bone or a mountain ridge. Prominent, then, means
sticking out either in a literal sense (a prominent nose) or a figurative one (a prominent figure in
the industry). The metaphorical sense of famous is the most common one today, though references to
the prominent posterior of Jennifer Lopez might fit both definitions.
