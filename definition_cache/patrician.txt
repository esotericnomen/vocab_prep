That refined gentleman over there with the excellent manners, the elegant suit, and the beautiful
home on Park Avenue? Heâ€™s a patrician, a member of the upper classes.

In ancient Rome, the word patrician referred to members of the aristocracy, but its meaning has
evolved to include those who belong to the upper classes. The adjective form of patrician describes
things that are associated with the upper class, like a patrician assumption that all children
should go to boarding school. Someone who enjoys refined dinners might be described as having
patrician taste.
