Oncology is the branch of medicine that deals with tumors and cancer. A doctor who practices
oncology is called an oncologist.

You probably think of cancer treatment as a modern practice, but the word oncology has its roots in
ancient Greek. The prefix onkos means mass or bulk” (and eventually evolved into the modern Latin
onco — meaning tumor) and the suffix logy means “study of.” In theory, the word means “the
study of tumors.” More often, though, you will hear oncology in relation to treatment and
practical medicine, as opposed to just study or research.
