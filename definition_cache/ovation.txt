Hear that applause and cries of Bravo? Your audience is giving you an ovation, or praise for a great
performance.

The noun ovation has origins in the Latin word ovare, meaning exult, rejoice, triumph.Ã¢&euro;?
Ancient Romans used it to describe a ceremony honoring a general entering Rome following a minor
triumph. By the nineteenth century ovation had taken on the more specific meaning: a display of
appreciation and applause from an audience. Today, especially great performers get standing
ovations, which means the audience rises from their seats as they clap.
