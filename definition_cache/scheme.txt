A scheme is an elaborate plan or plot. It's going to take a really solid scheme, probably involving
teleportation or some sort of temporary cloning, to make an appearance at both parties at once.

Scheme comes to us from the Latin word for figure. And it's still used today to refer to a set of
drawings and figures used to map out something. Or maybe youâ&euro;&trade;ve heard people talk
about something in the scheme of life. In that case they're talking about something that fits into
the bigger picture. But don't forget that schemes often carry a negative connotation â&euro;&rdquo;
the word brings to mind devious plans and secret plots organized by scheming bad guys.
