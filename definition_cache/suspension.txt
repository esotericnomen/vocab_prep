A suspension is a temporary stoppage. If you receive one in school, you temporarily can't attend
classes and if the referee gives you one, you have to sit out for the rest of the game.

If there is a suspension of diplomatic relations with another country or a suspension of sales of a
product, these things are stopped too. When you are suspended in mid-air, you are hanging above the
earth unable to use your feet. Think of floating like this as another sense of suspension. In your
car, the suspension system stops the bumps in the road from knocking you around. In science,
suspension is when particles that should sink are made buoyant by another substance and float, like
bubbles, off the bottom of a vessel.
