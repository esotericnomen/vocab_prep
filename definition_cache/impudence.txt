When you show impudence, you lack shame about your rude behavior. Examples of impudence? Not tipping
the waiter, sticking your tongue out, tripping your grandmother — you get the picture.

The noun impudence is derived from the Latin impudentia, shamelessness. Being rude is a main trait
of impudence; another is doing something you're not supposed to do — usually with an attitude that
shows you don't care. When you are acting with impudence, you are usually overstepping your
boundaries — like a kid who challenges his parents and can't accept Because I said so! as a reason
for discipline.
