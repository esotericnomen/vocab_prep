Rummage means to search for something, but in a scattered, disorganized manner. You can rummage
through your drawer looking for a lost sock, or you could even hold a rummage sale to sell off all
your socks that are missing their mates.

Ahoy, mateys: the word rummage hails from a sea-faring background. The Middle Dutch ruim, Germanic
rum, and Old English rum all referred to a compartment on a ship, probably stemming from the Middle
French verb arrumer, to stow goods in the hold of a ship. The idea of rummaging as searching was
first recorded in the 1620s. The first rummage sale also had its ship connection, as it was a sale
on the docks of unclaimed items.
