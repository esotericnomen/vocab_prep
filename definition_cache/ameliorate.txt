To ameliorate is to step in and make a bad situation better. You could try introducing a second
lollipop to ameliorate a battle between two four-year-olds over a single lollipop.

The verb ameliorate comes from the Latin word meliorare, meaning â&euro;&oelig;improve.â&euro;?
Food drives can ameliorate hunger. Aspirin can ameliorate a headache. A sympathy card can ameliorate
grief. Family therapy can ameliorate severe sibling rivalry. Anything that can lift a burden can
ameliorate.
