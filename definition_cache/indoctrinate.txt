If you indoctrinate someone, you teach that person a one-sided view of something and ignore or
dismiss opinions that donâ€™t agree with your view. Cults, political entities, and even fans of
particular sports teams are often said to indoctrinate their followers.

If you indoctrinate someone, the goal is to have that person follow a particular set of beliefs (or
a doctrine), rather than being able to think independently or know right from wrong. For example, a
child may be indoctrinated into a life of violence by growing up in a war-torn region, or a student
may be indoctrinated into a life as a Marxist by an influential political science professor.
