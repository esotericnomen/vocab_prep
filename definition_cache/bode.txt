The verb bode suggests prescience or forecasting. Something bodes well when the clues or signs imply
a favorable outcome. But if something bode ill, youâ€™d better watch out!

Something might bode good fortune, or it could bode disaster. The word, which can be traced back to
the Old English bodian to announce, foretell, is also found in the adjective foreboding, which means
ominous, boding ill.
