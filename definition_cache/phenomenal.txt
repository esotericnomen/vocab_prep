When something is so great, call it phenomenal. It's a solid choice when you want to describe your
new favorite thing with more syllables than just cool.

From a Greek root meaning appearance, phenomenal describes something so awesome and borderline
miraculous it really has to actually be seen to be believed. Worthy examples may be the Aurora
Borealis, the prowess of Michael Jordan, or the abilities of any given Marvel character blessed by
exposure to radioactive materials. However, it's typically used to give positive praise to any
person, event or item that seems to transcend the norm.
