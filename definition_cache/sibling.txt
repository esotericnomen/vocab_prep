A sibling is your brother or sister. It's that simple.

The word sibling once meant anyone who is related to you, but now it's reserved for children of the
same parent or parents. It is a word that was once out of use but then brought back into English in
the early 1900s as a useful word in anthropology. If you and your brother fight all of the time,
your parents might call it sibling rivalry. You might just call him annoying and run from the room.
