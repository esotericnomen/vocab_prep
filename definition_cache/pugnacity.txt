Pugnacity or a natural disposition to be aggressive or belligerent isn't considered a flattering
quality for a person to have. Then again, if you're a boxer, politician or lawyer, that feistiness
might actually come in handy.

Pugnacity comes from the Latin word pugnare, which means to fight. The word pugnacity almost looks
like it has the word nasty in it, which is fitting since a pugnacious person is one who can be nasty
or belligerent. Another way to remember its meaning is to associate the word city tucked inside it,
with the nature of cities, where people are known to be unfriendly and kind of aggressive.
