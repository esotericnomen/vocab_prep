A levee is an embankment, like a dam, constructed to prevent the overflow of a body of water. It can
also mean a formal reception. How do these two words relate? Read on...

In French, lever means to lift and se lever means to rise, literally lift yourself. When the king
rose from his bed and received visitors, that was a levee. When you raise up dirt or other materials
to build a dam or levee, that's also a levee. Now, official levees don't involve kings––but you
might hear of “a governor’s levee at the state capital.” And levee can be used as a verb,
meaning to make an embankment, or shore up.
