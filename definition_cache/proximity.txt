The word proximity means nearness, and it is often qualified by the word close. It was hard not to
see him cheating, when our desks are in such close proximity to one another.

Proximity derives from the Latin proximus nearest, which also gives us approximate, close to the
actual. It's interesting that the word proximity doesn't have an opposite (except the rather clunky
remoteness): I suppose humans are interested in talking about how close two close things are, but
when it comes to things that are remote, the distance doesn't matter so much.
