An interjection is a word like Hey! or Mmm! or Ugh! Interjections can also be longer interruptions
of a conversation or something happening.

The inter part of interjection, which means between, is a good clue that this is a term for words
that bust in on other strings of words. If you've ever said Whoa!, you've used an interjection.
Interjections interject or interrupt Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; they break into the conversation. People often
use interjections when excited, such as Yes! or Wow! You could also say, May I make an interjection?
That would be a polite way of saying you'd like to add something.
