Respiration is the act of breathing. You wear a ventilator if you need help with your respiration.

Everyone who breathes has the power of respiration. There is, however, another type of respiration
which occurs in cells. This is the process of taking in certain substances and putting out others
that a cell undergoes to produces energy. One single breath, the inhale and the exhale together, is
also called a respiration.
