A chronology is like a timeline: it tells what happened when.  A chronology of your day would begin
when you wake up and end when you go to sleep.  Hopefully, something interesting happened in
between.

Khronos is the Greek word for time and that's where chronology comes from.   If a movie has a lot of
flashbacks or doesn't tell a story straight through from beginning to end, you might have to give it
some thought in order to put together a chronology of events.  If you are a detective, a correct
chronology could be important to solving your case.
