When a mother loses her child, she's frantic. She's a crazed sort of agitated and goes on a frantic
search for her child. A scene is frantic if there's lots of action with little order.

Frantic is related to frenzy and both were originally ways to describe mental illness. Hundreds of
years ago, if you were frantic, you were stark raving mad. Today, frantic implies fast wild
movements or a desperate attempt to do something. On Christmas Eve, the scene at the mall was
frantic with shoppers desperately searching for their last few gifts. And a wild party would only be
called frantic if the police were called and everyone rushed to get away.
