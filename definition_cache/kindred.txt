Your kindred are your people. If you say are going to visit your kindred during the holidays, that
means you are going to visit your relatives.

The word kindred can be used as either an adjective or a noun. The noun version is somewhat archaic
— you are more likely to encounter this word in classic literature than in casual conversation.
You may be more familiar with the adjective version of the word, which has gained popular usage in
the term “kindred spirit” or “kindred soul,” which is used to describe those who share
similar attitudes, characteristics, or beliefs.
