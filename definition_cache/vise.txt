If you’re going to be doing a lot of woodworking, you’ll probably need a vise, a tool used to
clamp pieces of wood in place while you work on them.

The word vise came into English through the French word vis, meaning “screw.” Picture yourself
winding a lever that screws the jaws of a vise shut, and you’ll understand what it’s like to
operate a vise. Remember to spell the word with an s, as not to confuse it with sound-alike vice,
which can refer to a destructive habit that you’d like to break. The two words are unrelated in
meaning.
