An old man watching his grandchildren play might look back fondly on his halcyon days, remembering
the peaceful, happy time of his youth.

The word halcyon comes from a story in Greek mythology about the halcyon bird, which had the power
to calm the rough ocean waves every December so she could nest. Like those calm waters, halcyon has
come to mean a sense of peace or tranquility. People often use the phrase halcyon days to refer
idyllically to a calmer, more peaceful time in their past.
