Think of a large, fluffy, colorful feather and you are imagining a plume, something that can be used
decoratively, often in hats or vases, just as it creates a decorative element for the bird it comes
from.

We can trace the present word plume was probably taken from the Old English word plÌÅ∞mfether. Going
back further, we can find the Latin pluma meaning feather or down.  Plume is often applied to a
large puff of smoke or any mass that spreads into the air from a single source.  If you see a plume
of smoke coming from the chimney, the fireplace is going.  If you see a plume of smoke coming from
the window, call the fire department.
