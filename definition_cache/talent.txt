If you are especially good at something, you have a talent. You can have a talent for singing or a
talent for getting others to talk about themselves. People who work in creative professions are
often called the talent.

In Biblical times, a talent was a unit of money, and a New Testament parable tells of a master
punishing a servant for hiding, rather than investing, a bag of talents in the master's absence. The
interpretation of this parable to mean that you should not hide your God-given talents has led to
the current meaning of the word as the special qualities a person possesses.
