A malefactor has done something illegal and has been or will be convicted, such as the malefactor
who was videotaped stealing money from a cash register.

To correctly pronounce malefactor, remember that the first syllable, mal rhymes with pal. A
malefactor, however, is no friend you should have. Mal- comes from Latin and means bad, evil, and
facere means to perform. A malefactor performs evil acts, or to put it a little less dramatically,
does really bad things.
