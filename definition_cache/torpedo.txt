A torpedo is a type of missile or bomb fired underwater. To torpedo is to attack with torpedoes.

Torpedoes are cigar-shaped projectiles that are used to attack other submarines or boats. The word
torpedo comes from the name of a kind of electric ray that numbs you with its sting
(torpediniformes). Torpedoes can also be used to attack a target on land. When a submarine fires
torpedoes, they're torpedoing the target. Torpedoes explode upon impact, and they're very powerful
weapons.
