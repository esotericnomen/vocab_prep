Boon means something beneficial to a specific person, entity, or cause. Getting called out of school
on the day of the test was a boon for Sam, as he hadn't remembered to study.

Boon derives from the Old Norse bè´¸n, a request for a favor. Think of boon as a favor that no one
has necessarily asked for, something extra. We'd just spent our last dollar on a cup of coffee so it
was a real boon to find a ten dollar bill lying on the sidewalk. Boon can also be an adjective for
someone friendly and welcoming, as in a boon companion.
