If you know a confirmed bachelor who dates a lot of women but never settles down, he may not have
met the right person yet, or he may suffer from misogamy, a hatred of marriage.

Misogamy is made up of two Greek words, mis meaning hate, and gamy meaning marriage. You might get
it confused with another mis- word that sounds similar, misogyny, which is completely different as
it means a hatred of women.
