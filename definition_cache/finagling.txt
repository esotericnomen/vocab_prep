When you finagle, you get out of something using devious methods, like when you pretend you're sick
to avoid taking a pop quiz.

Finagle is a word with a usually negative connotation, as it means to get something by being
dishonest or tricking someone. To get a student discount from a bookstore by pretending you're a
student is to finagle the store clerk. Finagle might also mean to get your way by being clever, as
when you convince your sister that what she really wants for her birthday is that video game you've
been dreaming of for months.
