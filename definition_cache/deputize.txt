To deputize is to appoint someone as a substitute, like a police deputy authorizing a civilian to
make an arrest.

The original meaning refers to when a deputy would give some of their power to non-police officers.
When deputized, you took on some of the power of a deputy to help the real deputy. Similarly,
deputizing can refer to making anyone a substitute. A teacher can deputize a student by putting them
in charge of the class. A boss can deputize an employee by asking them to organize a meeting.
Deputizing empowers someone to do a job.
