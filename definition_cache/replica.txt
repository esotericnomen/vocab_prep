A replica of something is a close — sometimes exact — likeness. The Mona Lisa that you bought at
the department store is not the original but a replica of da Vinci's masterpiece. Sorry, but you can
always take it back.

If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, a replica is pure adulation. Someone creating a
replica is creating an imitation of the original. The word first appeared in 17th-century Italy,
taking its meaning from the word replicare, to reply or repeat, as used in music. In time, it came
to mean a copy, often of a work of art. In a stricter sense, the word refers to a copy created or
supervised by the artist of the original work.
