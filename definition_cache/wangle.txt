Wangle means to get something through deception or devious coaxing, like the time you tried to
wangle your way into a concert by pretending to be the singer's sister.

Wangle, which rhymes with tangle is similar in meaning to manipulate, although wangle has a more
informal feel. The word's playful sound hints at its origin Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; it came into English as
slang. In the 1880s it was coined by British printers who used their skills to wangle, or fake, an
image to look like something else. That tradition endures today with untrustworthy magazines that
wangle photos of celebrities to deceive readers.
