When you see fast, you might think of Olympic runner Usain Lightning Bolt or a Porsche 911 Turbo.
Alternatively, and quite confusingly, fast also means to refrain from eating for a certain period,
usually for religious reasons.

Fast is another of those deceptively simple words that have a number of other meanings beyond their
most common usages. If something sticks fast it means it cannot be removed â&euro;&rdquo; like a
leech or a stain. To stand fast means not to give up your point of view or to remain loyal. Then
there's also the slang meaning of living beyond the constraints of normal behavior â&euro;&rdquo;
as in the fast life, the fast track, or the fast lane.
