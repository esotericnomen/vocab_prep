When your essay about French cooking starts describing a childhood trip to Disneyland, it's taken a
digression â€” it's strayed from the main topic.

But I digress is a phrase often used by people when they realize they're no longer on-topic. A
digression is like a tangent, only digression often describes speech patterns, whereas tangent comes
to us from mathematics. Another trick to remembering the meaning of digression is its relationship
to the word progression. A progression is a series of ideas which proceeds in the same direction; a
digression, logically enough, is an idea that goes off in another direction.
