The pile of crumbled debris that's left over after something breaks or collapses is rubble. Famous
scenes of rubble include the fallen Twin Towers on September 11 and the remains of the Haitian
capital after the 2010 earthquake.

Rubble rhymes with bubble, but when a bubble bursts, it just dissolves into liquid, while rubble is
piles of rock, concrete, brick, and other remains that are a very physical reminder of destruction.
Rock slides create rubble from rocks, and natural disasters and explosions create rubble from
buildings, cars, and trees. Unfortunately, rubble is usually heavy and can trap people or things
beneath it, as when bodies are found in the rubble of a fire or earthquake.
