The author looked at the computer screen in horror. With one keystroke she had deleted  her entire
manuscript. Delete means to erase.

Delete has its roots in Latin and was first used to mean destroy. In modern usage, delete means to
remove completely. Delete used in writing means to edit by removing, often done by drawing a line
through the text to be deleted . This process is also called â&euro;&oelig;blue-penciling,â&euro;?
due to the use of the blue colored pencil that some editors use.
