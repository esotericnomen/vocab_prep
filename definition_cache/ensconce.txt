If you ensconce yourself somewhere, you settle in for quite a while, such as when you're home with
the flu and ensconce yourself on the couch with the remote control, tissues, your phone, and a big
glass of orange juice.

Ensconce dates to the 1580s, when it literally meant to cover with a fort. It isn't quite clear
whether the word can be traced to French or Dutch, which has a word schans that describes earthwork.
Today, you don't need a protective structure like a fort in order to be ensconced, but the idea of
being surrounded is key to the word's meaning.
