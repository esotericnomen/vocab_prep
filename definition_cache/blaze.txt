A blaze is a bright, strong flame. A raging fire is blazing and you can also say other types of
shining, like with talent, are types of blazing.

A fire is a blaze. Fire, when it's going strong and burning bright, is blazing. The greater the
blaze, the harder a fire is to put out. You can also use this word for other types of brightness or
shining. When Michael Jordan played in the NBA, he blazed across the league. Fashion trends that
catch on quickly blaze across the country. If something spreads or shines like wildfire, it blazes.
