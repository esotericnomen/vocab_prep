Lepidopterology is the study of butterflies and moths. If you plan to study lepidopterology, you
might go to college and major in zoology or biology.

People who study insects call their specialty entomology, and when an entomologist focuses
specifically on insects with scaly wings that hatch from caterpillars, she calls her field
lepidopterology. One of the most famous amateur lepidopterology enthusiasts was the writer Vladimir
Nabokov, who collected butterfly specimens throughout his life. The word itself comes from the Greek
roots lepido, scale, and pteron, wing or feather.
