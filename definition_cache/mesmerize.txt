You meet someone and you can’t take your eyes off them, like you are connected by an invisible
cord and can’t break free.  Those kinds of people have the power to mesmerize, holding your
attention like you’re under hypnosis.

The word mesmerize comes from the last name of 18th century German physician Franz Mesmer, who
believed that all people and objects are pulled together by a strong magnetic force, later called
mesmerism.  If you ever start to feel mesmerized, maybe it’s because you find someone fascinating,
or maybe you’ve been hypnotized by a magician.  Hard to tell from here.
