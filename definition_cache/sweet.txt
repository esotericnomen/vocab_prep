Food that’s sweet is full of sugar, bad for your teeth, but oh so tasty. People who are sweet are
super nice, like that sweet lunch lady who gives you an extra cookie.

Sweet can be an adjective or a noun. It can describe something pleasing to the senses, like a sweet
song, or when you're playing basketball and get nothing but net. Sweet! As a noun, it's a
confection, a little something for dessert. The poet Khalil Gibran said, “Friendship is always a
sweet responsibility, never an opportunity.” Don’t opportunistically take your friends for
granted, or you could become the target of some sweet revenge.
