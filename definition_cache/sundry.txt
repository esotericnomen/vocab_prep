A woman emptying out her purse after many years might find an old stick of gum, a pair of broken
sunglasses, a few movie tickets, and sundry items, meaning that that her purse was filled with a
random collection of unrelated things.

Most people associate the word sundry with the old-fashioned drugstore in their neighborhood that
used to sell all sorts of odds and ends, from magazines to hairbrushes. The word is typically used
as an adjective to describe a collection of various different items found in one place, as in
Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; I discovered records, perfume bottles, and sundry items at my neighbor's yard sale.
The phrase all and sundry refers collectively to a group of people, as in, I invited all and sundry
of my relatives to my tea party.
