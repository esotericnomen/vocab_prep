Weary as an adjective means very tired or worn out, like weary students who finished a long week of
studying and taking tests.

Weary comes from the Old English word werig, meaning tired. It can also describe being extremely
bored and sick of something, like on a long drive, you might grow weary of your father's singing
voice. As a  verb, weary means to exhaust or wear out, like when the children you are babysitting
weary you with their game of running away every time you tell them to get ready to leave the park.
