A grotto is a small cave, the kind of place where you feel comfortable, cozy, and protected from the
harsh realities outside.

This word started in Greek (as the word that also gives us crypt), turned into Latin and then
Italian, and finally landed in English in the 1600s as grotto. A grotto can be natural or manmade,
but either way, it's a small cave or hidden room with cool and inviting features like a comfy floor
or round walls. A grotto is a good place to read, write, or just hang out with friends, especially
on a hot summer day.
