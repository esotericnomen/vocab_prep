Something made of artificial material, not natural items, can be described as synthetic. Football
stadiums have synthetic grass, just as many aging actresses have synthetic body parts.

The adjective synthetic usually describes things created by chemical synthesis (synthetic compound,
synthetic drug, synthetic material), but it sometimes describes an emotion that is feigned or not
genuine. A person who exudes only synthetic friendliness probably isn't someone you want to hang out
with, for example.
