Whether in the human body or on a computer, a virus is a disease-causing agent. If you come down
with a nasty stomach virus, be sure to drink lots of water, get lots of rest, and stay near the
toilet.

Virus comes from a Latin word that was spelled the same way. It specifically referred to the
poisonous sap of certain plants, which explains why it sounds similar to viscous, a word meaning
sticky.  Nowadays, it√¢&euro;&trade;s used to describe something that causes infectious diseases,
specifically a tiny, self-replicating agent made up of genetic material and protein.
