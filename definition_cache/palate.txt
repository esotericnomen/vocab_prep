Touch your tongue to the top of your mouth. What you're touching is your palate. Palate is often
used when discussing taste in a broader sense, as in: chocolate cake is pleasing to the palate.

A person with an expensive palate only likes high-priced culinary treats. Someone who tastes slight
nuances in food is said to have a well-developed palate, and someone who only likes fancy food is
said to have a sophisticated palate. In reality, there are no taste sensors on the palate
â&euro;&ldquo;â&euro;&ldquo; they have well-developed tongues. But that doesn't sound
sophisticated at all, does it?
