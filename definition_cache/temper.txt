Temper can refer to a tendency to become unreasonably angry. If you’re not sure whether you have a
temper, ask your friends — but don’t get mad if you dislike what they have to say.

Temper has a number of related yet distinct meanings. In addition to describing a tendency to anger,
temper can also refer to one’s mood in general; if you use the word in this sense, you might
describe someone's temper as angry or mild. Temper can also be used as a verb meaning “to
restrain.” If you have a nasty temper, you might try tempering your temper by counting to ten
whenever you’re tempted to throw a temper tantrum, or fit.
