Superimpose means laying one thing on top of another. It's often use to describe images in a photo
collage â€” like the superimposed image of a skyscraper on the surface of the moon.

The verb superimpose is typically used in graphics or photography to describe how images can be put
on top of one another for dramatic effect. Use it also to show adding your own take on something, or
when you try to have an impact on someone's behavior: She tried to superimpose  her ideas of
perfection onto the lazy habits of her children.
