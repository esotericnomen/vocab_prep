Gusty, the adjective, describes what the wind is like when leaves are swirling around in the air,
garbage blowing all over city streets, and hats refusing to stay put.

Read this word too quickly and you may think it says gutsy — an entirely different word. See the
base gust — as in a gust of wind — and you'll get more than a hint as to what gusty means. Gusty
typically relates to the weather — describing blustery winds, sudden outbursts, strong on-again/
off-again blasts of cold air. Go outside the box and use it to depict a person's stormy, emotional
behavior, especially if he has quick, sudden outbursts: He was given to gusty behavior whenever you
mentioned her name.
