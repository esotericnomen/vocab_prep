If you’re having a torrid romance, that means it's steamy and emotionally charged. If you’re
listening to a torrid band, then you’re listening to a band that has a lot of energy.

Torrid is an adjective that describes something that's extremely hot — in both the literal and the
figurative senses. It also describes something that's very energetic, or something that has an
extreme emotional charge — which is why people often apply torrid to love affairs. Torrid comes
from the Latin word torrere, meaning “parch or scorch.” Being scorched can sometimes be
exciting, but when you’re parched, you need water — and maybe a break from dating.
