Something with opulence is drenched in wealth and luxury. You'll need gold brocaded curtains,
diamond-encrusted watches, and a world-renowned personal chef if you want to add some opulence to
your life.

Not surprisingly, the noun opulence comes from the Latin opulentia, meaning “wealthy.” A word
that suggests extravagant excess, opulence describes lavish and visibly over-the-top living.
Synonyms include abundance, prosperity, and riches. Said the novelist Joseph Conrad, “Protection
is the first necessity of opulence and luxury.” Meaning, first secure one’s riches and safety,
and then enjoy without a care in the world!
