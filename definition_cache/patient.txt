You are patient if you don't get frustrated or annoyed when you have to wait or deal with
difficulties. The band director may show patient leadership, but a football coach uses other methods
with his team.

It may be difficult to wait for something that takes a long time or deal with someone who is
annoying, but if you are patient, you endure these things calmly and without frustration. Endure is
the keyword here as patient comes from the Latin verb pati to suffer, endure. Think of the patient
way a chess player wins a game Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; calmly, steadily and willing to wait for the right
time to act.
