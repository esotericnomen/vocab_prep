If something is in its prime, it is at its best. The same goes for a person. If you are young and
healthy and in the prime of your life, you are ready to take on the world.

Prime often means main. The prime reason you go to concerts is to see your favorite groups perform.
If your mother is angry that you came home late, tell her that this is a prime example of why you
need a cell phone Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; so you can call her. It can also mean of the highest quality as in
prime beef or flowers. As a verb, prime means to get ready. Hopefully you've primed yourself for
your exams. Prime the pump and start the engine!
