Running out to get pizza to bring back before the big game? This short, quick, pleasurable trip
could be called a jaunt (unless of course, you get your pizza from Italy, that’s called “time to
get a closer pizza place”).

Jaunt was used in the 17th century to describe a journey on a horse just long enough to tire the
horse out. Nebraska has what they call a Junk Jaunt, which is a yard sale that includes up to 40
towns and stretches nearly 300 miles and draws up to 20,000 people. That’s more than enough to
make any horse tired, but they call it a jaunt nevertheless.
