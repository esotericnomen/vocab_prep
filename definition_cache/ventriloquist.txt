Ventriloquists prove that even adults sometimes play with dolls. Specifically, these performers
pretend to make their dolls, puppets, or dummies speak for entertainment purposes.

The Latin word ventriloquium means â&euro;&oelig;to speak from the stomach.â&euro;? Ventriloquists
have learned the art of projecting their voices, speaking without moving their lips, and moving the
mouths of their dummies simultaneously so that it seems like their dummies are talking. Usually,
they sit on a stage and pretend to have a conversation as part of a comedy routine.
