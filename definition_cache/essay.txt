A composition that is usually short and has a literary theme is called an essay. You should probably
start writing your essay on To Kill a Mockingbird sometime before the bus ride to school the day it
is due.

As a noun, an essay is also an attempt, especially a tentative initial one. Your essay to make
friends at your new school would probably work better if you actually spoke to other students. As a
verb, to essay is to make an attempt. If you essay to run for student council, you might lose to the
girl who promises more recess, longer lunches, and less homework.
