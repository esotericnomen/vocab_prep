People, especially those in leadership positions, are described as unaccountable when they behave as
though they don't need to explain themselves, answer to anyone else, or take responsibility for
their actions.

We often complain about the need for accountability when our leaders spend our money, oversee our
wars, or make confusing new laws without explaining to us what's going on. If there's nothing in
place to keep them from being corrupt, we say that they are unaccountable. Another interesting
definition of unaccountable is unexplainable. Crop circles, Big Foot sightings, and unidentified
flying objects are mysterious and unaccountable.
