Our principal published her fifty-page Treatise on Gum Chewing days before she was carted away by
men in white coats. Treatises are formal papers that treat a specific subject. Gum chewing shouldn't
merit one.

Treatise is related to the verb treat, which means deal with. A doctor treats a patient. A teacher
treats the senator's child with kid gloves. Treatise means a written paper or exposition that deals
with or treats a specific subject.
