The hard thing about learning how to parallel park is trying to get the car close enough to the curb
without hitting it. A curb is the edge of the sidewalk beside the road.

When you're using the word curb as a noun, it's the raised edging beside a street. When curb is a
verb, it means to restrain or hold back, like when you curb your impulse to laugh while watching a
badly acted play. Curb comes from the Latin word for curve, curvus, which describes the shape of a
restraining strap on a horse's head Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; in the fifteenth century, this band was called a
curb.
