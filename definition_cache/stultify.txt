When something stultifies you, it drains you of your energy, enthusiasm, or pleasure. A well-acted
Shakespeare play can be a thrill. A poorly-acted one can stultify like nothing else.

The verb stultify is sometimes used in place of bore or exhaust, but only if something is so boring
or exhausting that it makes you feel as though you might just die. It's a very negative word. If
you're in a relationship that's stultifying, you should find a way out. Relationships should make
you feel more alive, not less. Constant construction noise can have a stultifying effect, leaving a
person almost unable to function.
