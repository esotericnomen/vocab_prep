Think of an edge, a border, a boundary, and you are thinking about the verge, the point where
something begins or ends.

We talk about a nervous person being on the verge of a breakdown, or about a scientist being on the
verge of a major breakthrough, but the British have another good physical meaning: they call the
strip of grass that borders a walkway the verge, giving you a clear mental picture that goes beyond
the abstract.
