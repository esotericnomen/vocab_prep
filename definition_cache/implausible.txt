Something that's Implausible is farfetched or unlikely. If it's 3pm and you still have to study for
three exams and write an essay before midnight, it’s implausible that you’ll also have time to
watch a movie.

The adjective implausible breaks down into im, meaning “not,” and plausible, meaning likely. So
it simply means not likely. Implausible ideas or stories usually get high marks for creativity, but
they're just too crazy to be believable. But as philosopher Rene Descartes noted, “One cannot
conceive anything so strange and so implausible that it has not already been said by one philosopher
or another.”
