Anything that you could possibly use for food is a comestible, a synonym of edible. It can be used
as a noun (We shopped for comestibles) or an adjective (It looked awful, but was comestible).

The word comestible, a rather formal-sounding word for food, has its roots in the Latin word
comedere, which means to eat up. Since comestible shares a background with the word consume, you
will hopefully remember its meaning. Comestible was first recorded in the 15th century, and it
bounced around as an adjective before becoming a noun in the 19th century.
