When the President of The United States gives a speech, he often stands at a wooden lectern
featuring the presidential seal. A lectern is a stand you lecture from.

Lecterns often feature a sloped top and a little lamp to make reading from a paper or notes easier.
The word lectern comes from the Latin word legere which means to read. Podium is a word from the
Greek that means the same thing. Lecterns serve another purpose for nervous readers Ã¢&euro;&rdquo;
they offer a good hiding place for shaking hands.
