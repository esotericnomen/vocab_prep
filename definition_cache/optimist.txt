An optimist is someone who always sees the bright side of any situation — a trait that can be
either encouraging or annoying, depending on your frame of mind.

Winston Churchill once said, “A pessimist sees the difficulty in every opportunity; an optimist
sees the opportunity in every difficulty.” When you think about the problems in the world, it
might sometimes be difficult to remain an optimist. Yet some people just naturally look for the
silver lining, like Eeyore in the Winnie the Pooh stories who, when admitting that it's still
snowing and freezing, remarks, However, we haven't had an earthquake lately. Now that's an optimist!
