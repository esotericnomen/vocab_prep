The adjective frenzied describes something wild, excited, or rushed. You may have a frenzied morning
when you've overslept and need to get lunches made, the dog walked, and the kids off to school
within the next fifteen minutes. Run!

Frenzied is from the word frenzy, which itself is from the Latin word phreneticus, meaning
delirious. Words related to frenzied include frantic and frenetic, but frenzied isn't necessarily
bad. If you're a rock star, you may enjoy a frenzied crowd at your concerts, and you feed off the
energy and adoration you get from them. If it's your first time on stage, however, that same
frenzied crowd may send you into a panic.
