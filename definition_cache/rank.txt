The word rank often deals with an order of some kind.  If you are a high-ranking officer in the
military, you can boss around soldiers of lower rank.

Linguists see the Old English ranc as having roots prior to the 11th Century, possibly from the Old
Norse rakkr, meaning straight.  The order of ranks from lowest to highest proceeds in a straight
line, as does a rank of marching soldiers.  You can also use rank to describe an especially foul
smell.  No matter what rank you are, you must not enjoy walking into the mess hall and realizing
that the rank smell in the air is today's lunch.
