If you've got myriad problems it doesn't mean you should call a myriad exterminator, it means you've
got countless problems; loads of them; too many to count. Welcome to the club.

Myriad is one of those words rarely used in speech but only in written form. You would usually use a
phrase like lots of or loads of instead. I mean, you could say I've got myriad problems, but
everyone would probably just laugh at you, and rightly so. Originally from ancient Latin and Greek
words meaning ten thousand Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; so perhaps you can put a number on myriad, after all.
