Something linear is like a line. The adjective usually refers to something that follows an expected
order or sequence — like railroad tracks or even the progression of a disease.

Drawn from the word line, something linear follows that concept, coming from the Latin līneāris,
belonging to a line.  You might come across the word in mathematics, as in a linear equation, or in
electronics, with a linear circuit. It also can be used to refer to a written work that follows a
linear narrative.  If a movie has lots of flashbacks and happens out of order, it does not have a
linear narrative.  You might find such a movie puzzling but enjoyable, or you might prefer something
some chronological and linear.
