Anything with a bunch of levels or stages can be considered a gradation. In high school, the process
of moving from freshman to senior year could be called a gradation, or your position in the series
of steps that lead toward graduation.

Any organization with a hierarchy, set up so that some members are considered better, higher, or
more respected than others, has a gradation of positions within it. The military is a great example,
with a gradation, or series of steps, from private to general. The root of gradation is the Latin
gradationem, which means ascent by steps.
