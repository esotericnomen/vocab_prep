When something is sanguinary it involves a lot of blood or, at least, the pursuit of blood. Vampire
movies are sanguinary: Romper Room is not.

If you're familiar with French, then you'll recognize the French word for blood, sang, in
sanguinary. And if you do, then you'll have no trouble remembering the meaning, having a
bloodthirsty quality. Movies have become increasingly sanguinary. Why all the blood and gore? What
happened to good old-fashioned suspense?
