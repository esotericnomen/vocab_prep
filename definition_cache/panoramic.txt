Many cameras have a button that lets you take a picture in panoramic mode––this mode is wider
and meant for landscape shots. Panoramic refers to an unbroken or wide-ranging view.

One of the reasons people climb to the tops of mountains or tall buildings is for the panoramic
views. You can see everything without obstruction. You would hope that our leaders have a similar
panoramic outlook on the development of the country––taking into account environmental, social,
and educational needs for the future.
