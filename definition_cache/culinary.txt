Culinary means having to do with cooking or the kitchen. If you go to culinary school, you're
learning how to cook, most likely because you want to work as a chef.

If you have a culinary streak, you might love cooking for your friends or maybe just watching
cooking shows on TV. If your culinary repertoire includes nothing beyond tuna sandwiches and mac-
and-cheese out of the box, you have a lot to learn, culinarily speaking!
