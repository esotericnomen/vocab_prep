To cede is to give up or surrender land, position, or authority. She reluctantly ceded the coveted
position as the baby of the family to her brother when he was born.  She would not, however, cede
her bedroom to him.

Cede is a word often used in discussing diplomatic issues.  It is more commonly used in reference to
actual physical things, like geographic areas or objects, but can also be used in reference to
attitudes or opinions. The rebels ceded territory after the siege failed. Dad tried but finally
ceded control and let me have my own Facebook account.
