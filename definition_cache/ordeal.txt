An ordeal is something difficult or painful to go through. Something kind of hard like taking a test
can be an ordeal, but often an ordeal is a serious and long-lasting event, like an illness or
tragedy.

When you go through an ordeal you have to deal with something tough. Waiting for someone you love to
recover from an injury and come home from the hospital is an ordeal––for both of you––and
being a victim of a crime is a different kind of ordeal. You can use this noun in an exaggerated
way, too, as when you endure the long ordeal of cleaning the garage on a sunny weekend.
