Veteran commonly refers to someone who has fought in a war––think Veterans' Day, the Vietnam
Veterans' Memorial––but, in fact, the word can mean anyone with experience in a particular
field.

Many veterans of World War II went to college afterward, through the G.I. Bill, and pursued
professional careers. At the end of those careers, it was not unusual to find among the ranks of
veteran teachers or veteran attorneys or veteran doctors men who were also veterans of the war.
