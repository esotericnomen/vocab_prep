To traduce is to badmouth someone or something. If you don't want people talking trash about you,
then don't traduce them either — even if they started it.

Among cabaret performers, there is long tradition of traducing other performers — though at its
heart, it's really a way of showing affection. Showing love by being mean: such is the strange world
of camp. Of course, in order to know that a person is being funny when they traduce another person,
you usually have to know them both pretty well. So if you're not either very familiar or very funny,
avoid traducing other people for laughs: they're likely to think that you meant all those nasty
things.
