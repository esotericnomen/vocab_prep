Something that is staid is dignified, respectable — possibly even boring, like a staid dinner
party that is heavy on the important guests but light on the laughs.

Staid is pronounced just like stayed — in fact, it comes from  stay, meaning fixed or permanent.
Something that is staid is sedate, slightly dull, and tends to stay the same. Whether it’s a
middle-class lifestyle, a conservative law firm, your unadventurous aunt, or an old navy plaid sofa,
the word staid can be used to describe anything that maintains a respectable self-restraint and
takes no chances.
