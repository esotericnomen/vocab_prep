When you make fun of something by imitating it in a humorous way, you're lampooning it. The writers
at The Onion, Saturday Night Live and FunnyOrDie.com are all experts in the art of the lampoon.

Lampoon can be both a verb and a noun. To lampoon is ridicule. A lampoon is a parody or satire.
Imagine you were frustrated by having your allowance reduced, so you wrote a funny play portraying
mom and dad as dictators extracting lots of unfair taxes from their people. That's lampooning. And
it probably won't help your allowance situation.
