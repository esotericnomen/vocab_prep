If you like someone but you wouldn't say they're your friend, you might describe your relationship
as cordial. Use cordial to describe a greeting or relationship that is friendly and sincere.

In Middle English, this adjective meant of the heart, borrowed from Medieval Latin cordi√Ñ lis, from
Latin cor heart. This core sense of heart can be seen in the synonyms heartfelt and hearty. The noun
cordial originally referred to a medicine or drink that stimulates the heart, but its current sense
is a liqueur.
