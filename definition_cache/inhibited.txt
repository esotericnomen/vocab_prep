If something is inhibited it is held back from doing something, the way the presence of your
grandmother might inhibit you from cursing.

We often use the word inhibited to describe someone√¢&euro;&trade;s behavior, especially if that
person is afraid to do something, but it could also describe the simple fact of being restrained. If
you washed your pants in hot water and they shrank and you only barely squeezed them on, your
movement would be inhibited.
