Rancid is a great name for a post-punk band, but a lousy way to describe the sauce on your eggs
Benedict.  Rancid means sour, rotten, nasty and refers most specifically to the sharp bad smell of
decomposing oils or fats.

If you've never had the pleasure of smelling something rancid, life has quite a wallop in store for
you. As meat, fat, or oil decomposes the chemical change creates a sharp wretched stink that will
cause you to recoil. It's just foul. The powerful horrendous fragrance of rancid butter, therefore,
makes the word wonderfully potent to describe all sorts of things Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; from a corrupt
dictatorship to a party that's gone on a few hours too long.
