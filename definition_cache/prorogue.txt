Prorogue is a technical way of saying put off or delay.  Usually, it describes a something a
government body does: when a congress or parliament prorogues, it's putting off business for awhile.

Prorogue comes from the Latin word prorogare meaning to stretch out.    When you stop a meeting and
decide to meet again at a later time,  this stretches out the work being  done.  Remember that
prorogue is close to prolong, which means pretty much the same thing, but without a break.
