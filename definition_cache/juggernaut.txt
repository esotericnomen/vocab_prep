Juggernaut means a massive force. If the army marching into your country is a juggernaut, you're
doomed. If you're trying to market a new Cola product, you're up against corporate giant Coca-Cola,
a beverage juggernaut if ever there was one.

With its roots in Hindi, juggernaut originally referred to a crude statue from which the Hindu god,
Brahma, turned into the living god, Krishna. There continues to be a festival in honor of this
miracle, in which a statue of Krishna is carted through town. It is said that in times past,
devotees would throw themselves under the cart√¢&euro;&trade;s wheels.
