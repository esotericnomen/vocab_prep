Forward is the direction ahead of you, or toward the front of something. It can also be a position
on a basketball, soccer, or hockey team.

Forward can be a direction of either space or time, and also implies progress. A forward-thinking
person thinks about what will happen in the future. If you forward an email, you send it on to a new
recipient. But if you forward a cause, that means you helped propel it to success. If you’re at a
bar and someone tells you you’re being awfully forward, you’re probably coming on too strong.
