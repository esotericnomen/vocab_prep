Use promiscuous to describe someone who will say yes to just about anything. If you are the kind of
person who will go on a date with just about anyone, you might get  labeled promiscuous by  your
peers.

Promiscuous is not limited to a romantic context. Long ago promiscuous described a disorderly
mixture of people and things, and shades of that original meaning linger. If a chef at an Italian
restaurant is promiscuous, you might find him mixing ingredients from South America or Asia into his
pasta. Carpet bombing as opposed to targeted invasion might be called a promiscuous use of military
force.
