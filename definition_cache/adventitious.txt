Adventitious is a word you use to talk about things that just kind of happen, not because you are
trying to do them, but because they just come along.

Christopher Columbus's stumbling upon the Caribbean while searching for a new route to India was
adventitious. When you make an adventitious rhyme while speaking, you might hear, You're a poet, you
didn't know it, your long feet show it.
