If you work in a mine and you find a stripe of gold that seems to stretch on forever, you’ve found
a lode of gold — a supply vein of ore.  You’re also rich.

Don’t confuse lode with load.  They sound exactly the same, but while load means a big pile of
something, lode means that something’s original source.  It usually refers to valuable metals, but
you can find a lode of anything, like the lollipop lode at a candy factory or a lode of laughter at
a comedy show.  You’ll hear about the “mother lode,” which is a lode beyond your imagination,
like the mother lode of riches inside a dragon’s den.
