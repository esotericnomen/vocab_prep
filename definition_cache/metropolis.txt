A large, densely populated urban area is called a metropolis. She liked living in a metropolis
because there were many opportunities in a city that were not available elsewhere, like 24-hour
diners.

The noun metropolis comes from the Greek roots mētēr, meaning mother, and pólis, meaning city.
Historically, the word referred to the founding city-state of a region in Ancient Greece. Today the
word refers to any urban area. The largest metropolis in Massachusetts is Boston, which is also the
capital. Sometimes people use the word metropolis ironically or sarcastically: She came from the
booming metropolis of Tumbleweed, population 325.
