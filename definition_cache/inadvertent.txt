When something happens by accident, it's inadvertent, or unintentional.  The gas company assured you
that the error in your bill  was inadvertent and that they would fix it, but not before you blew off
some steam.

If you break down the adjective inadvertent you find the word vert, from the Latin vertere, meaning
to turn.  Advertent comes to mean turning the mind to, and as the prefix in- means not, inadvertent
means “not turning the mind to,” or not intending to. When your actions are inadvertent you're
not paying attention to their consequences.  Remember that inadvertent ends with -ent by remembering
this sentence: “We inadvertently ripped the tent.”
