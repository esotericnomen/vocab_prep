An eponym is either a person for whom something is named, or a thing named for a person. Jules
Leotard, a trapeze artist, inspired the creation of the eponym leotard. Thanks, Jules.

Words are formed in many ways: often, they are named after people. For example, the boycott was
named after Charles C. Boycott. That makes Boycott an eponym, and boycott is also an eponym. Eponyms
are the people who provide the names and the words that are formed from the names. St. Audrey is
another eponym, because her name inspired the word tawdry.
