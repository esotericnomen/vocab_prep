You can describe something that is dried up, withered, or without moisture with the adjective sere.
The desert climate, for example, is sere, as is your skin after a day in the wind.

Sereâ&euro;&trade;s shriveled and withered meaning crops up in things like Shakespeare's Macbeth
(My way of life Is fallâ&euro;&trade;n into the sere, the yellow leaf; 5:III), or in archaic
reference to Sere-month (August), but it isn't frequently used in normal modern conversation. The
variant spelling of sere is sear, which has other meanings that see more modern use.
