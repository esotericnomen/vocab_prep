Something flagrant is bad — so bad you can't ignore it. A flagrant foul in sports might send you
to the bench, and a flagrant violation of the law might send you to the slammer.

The current meaning of the adjective flagrant — obviously offensive or disgraceful — is thought
to derive from the Latin legal term in flagrante delicto, which literally meant with fire still
blazing and is used figuratively to describe a situation in which the criminal is caught red handed.
Aside from a flagrant abuse of the law, the word can also be used to describe anything that is
obviously bad — like flagrant bad taste or flagrant abuse of the rules of grammar.
