Saline is an adjective that means salty. While salty is a perfectly good word to use when describing
French fries or tears, saline tends to be a word you might hear in a more official setting, like in
a hospital or in a geology class.

If you watch a lot of hospital dramas on TV, you have definitely heard the exclamation,
â&euro;&oelig;Nurse, the patient needs an IV saline solution, stat!â&euro;? because sick people in
hospitals tend to get saline solutions to keep them hydrated. Saline mostly has a scientific
meaning; it is not usually used to mean salty tasting.  If you want to get really scientific, salt
is actually called sodium chloride, but sodium chloride pretzels would probably not fly off the
grocery store shelves.
