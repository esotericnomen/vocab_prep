A hireling is someone doing a job solely for the money. The work they do is therefore tainted. A hit
man might be dismissed as a hireling by the FBI, who wants to go after the mafia boss who is hiring
the murderer.

If you have been raised with the idea that there is dignity in hard work of any kind, it may be hard
to understand the negative connotations associated with the word hireling. Like mercenary, it
implies that some jobs should be done only out of moral convictionâ&euro;&ldquo;â&euro;&ldquo;a
hireling will never have the right attitude or love to do things right.
