If you have a great number of refrigerator magnets, you have many of them. Many means a lot of
items.

Many can be traced back to the Welsh word mynych meaning frequent. To get many of something, you do
something frequently, or often, like having many miles on a car because you often drive it long
distances. If you ask, How many people will be at the party? you want to know the number of guests
who are expected. If the answer is many, you know there will be numerous people, though you haven't
been given an exact figure.
