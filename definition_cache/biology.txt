Biology is the study of life and living organisms, from one-celled creatures to the most complex
living organism of all â€” the human being. Biology includes the study of genes and cells that give
living things their special characteristics.

You may know that the ology suffix means the study of, and the addition of the Greek bios, meaning
life, gives us the meaning of biology.  According to Nobel Laureate Walter Gilbert, Biology will
relate every human gene to the genes of other animals and bacteria, to this great chain of being.
Sometimes science isn't as pretty as that sounds (as you know if you've cut open worms or frogs in
biology class).
