Ladies, the rakish fellow you met last night with the suave dance moves, smoothly rehearsed lines,
and your number listed as “Goddess #14” in his phone is fine for a flirt, but probably isn’t
meet-the-parents material.

Used as an adjective to describe a dashing ladies’ man or a streamlined ship, rakish comes from
the fusing of rake + -ish. Don Juan, the famous Spanish nobleman immortalized in 17th century
Spanish tales, is the epitome of rakish: stylishly handsome and prone to saucy, fast behavior.
Synonyms include charming, flashy, and immoral.
