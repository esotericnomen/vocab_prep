Contusion is really just a fancy word for a bad bruise. Professional athletes are often benched
suffering from contusions. After all, if they're being paid millions, it sounds kinda wimpy to pull
them because they're suffering from a...bruise.

A contusion is any damage to the body that doesn't break the skin but ruptures the blood capillaries
beneath, resulting in a handsome-looking discoloration. For once, it's a medical term not used
widely to describe a broader emotional or psychological state. You could talk about an emotional
contusion, but please, better not to. There are better terms around (see heartbroken, wounded,
forlorn, etc.). Your audience will thank you.
