A satellite is something small or less powerful that orbits around something bigger. It often
describes a body in space, such as an artificial satellite that orbits the Earth and beams down
signals that power devices like cell phones.

The word satellite was first used to describe a follower of someone in a superior position. The
word's meaning later broadened to describe anything small that's dependent on something larger. The
small satellite circles around the more powerful force, like a moon orbiting a planet. Satellite can
describe a small country — a satellite country — controlled by a larger one, or a large
organization that has a small office — a satellite office — in another location.
