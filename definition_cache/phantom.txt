Look over there, across the room.  Is that a phantom, some weary soul come back from the dead to
haunt you?  Maybe it’s a shadow, or maybe it’s a ghost.  Either way, turn on a light and it’ll
disappear.  Hopefully.

Sleeping is difficult if there’s a phantom in your room, because who can rest with ghosts around?
Some phantoms are real, but phantom can also be used to mean a trick of the mind, like hearing a
person outside your window, but then realizing it’s only the phantom rustling of leaves in a tree.
Phantom limb is when someone loses an arm or leg, but their brain can still feel where their limb
used to be.
