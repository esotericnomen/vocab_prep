If something is indelible, you better hope you never regret it, like the indelible tattoo of the
name of your favorite band or the indelible first impression it might give people you meet years
from now, especially if your taste in music changes.

The adjective indelible describes something that can't be erased or removed, like marks made by an
indelible marker, or an indelible moment you will never forget, like your first day of kindergarten
or the first time you visit a new, exotic place. It comes from the Latin word indelebilis, meaning
not able to be destroyed.
