If it has to do with other countries or their people, it is foreign, like a French movie receiving a
British award for Best Foreign Film.

The adjective foreign is based on the Latin word foris, meaning â&euro;&oelig;outside.â&euro;? A
foreign exchange student goes outside of his or her country to study. When you learn a foreign
language, it is outside of the one you first learned. If you sleep late on the weekends, someone
might say, Getting up early on Saturdays is a foreign concept to you. This means it's outside of
your experience and knowledge.
