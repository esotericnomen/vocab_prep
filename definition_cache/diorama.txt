If you use a shoebox and tiny toys to recreate the Battle of Normandy, you are creating a diorama,
or three dimensional model, of the event.

At the Museum of Natural History in New York, you'll see dioramas, or scenes of animals or ancient
peoples in their habitats. Before things like movies, television, and computers became common, the
best way for large numbers of people to get an idea of what a lion might look like devouring its
prey was by diorama.
