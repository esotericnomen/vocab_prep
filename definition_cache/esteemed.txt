If lots of people respect you and you're known around town as a wise and intelligent person whose
opinion matters, then you're esteemed.

Esteemed comes from the verb esteem, which means to think valuable. If you are esteemed, then people
think you're a valuable person to have around, and have a lot of respect for you. If you're hosting
a dinner party with a special guest, an elderly man who has traveled the world and written many
books, you could introduce him as your esteemed guest.
