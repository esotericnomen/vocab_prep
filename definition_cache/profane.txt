Profane is the sort of language that gets bleeped on TV but it's also whenever you deeply offend
people with how little respect you show something (usually religious).

The Latin root profanus means unholy, and that's where it all started. If you take the Lord's name
in vain, you've profaned Him and probably made your mom pretty angry too. Don't even try the curse
words so vital to a truly great hip-hop track but perhaps not recommended for dinner with Grandma.
