The verb expatiate means to add details to in order to clear up. If your story is confusing to
everyone who hears it, certain key parts must be missing. Better expatiate so that people can
understand it.

To pronounce expatiate correctly, accent the second syllable: ex-PAY-she-ate. When you expatiate,
you add details, usually to something you are writing. The goal is to make your ideas clearer to
readers, perhaps by offering an example to help them understand. Teachers can tell when you are
expatiating and when you are just adding to what you've written, say, reach a certain length
requirement. That's usually called padding.
