A herd is a bunch of animals, or — people who act like a bunch of animals. It's also a verb —
when people herd animals, they try to keep them moving in the same direction.

A herd usually refers to a group of animals with hooves, like cows or sheep (meat-eating animals
like wolves cruise around in packs). On a farm, sheepdogs are in charge of herding the herd of
sheep. Herds of buffalo roam the plains. It's rarely a good thing when people act like a herd, which
is to do what everyone else is doing. You might want to break away from the herd if everyone is
wearing pinwheel hats, for example. If you're having trouble getting people together, you might say
it's like herding cats. Cats never follow directions.
