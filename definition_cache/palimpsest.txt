If you are writing fast and hastily erase something not quite all the way and continue writing right
over the smudgy bit, then you’ve created a palimpsest — which means you can see traces of the
earlier writing mixed in with the new.

The noun palimpsest originally described a document, such as a page from a manuscript written on
parchment, that had been rubbed smooth so it could be used again, with traces of the original
writing showing through. The word still carries that meaning, but ancient manuscripts are rare these
days, so you’re more likely to hear palimpsest used to describe something that has traces of early
stages showing through, like the palimpsest of an urban neighborhood — in which hints of earlier
styles and designs are still evident among the new highrises.
