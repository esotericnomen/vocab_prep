Surely only an evil person could be so vile as to have made you so angry. Vile is something or
someone so morally wrong or offensive as to be thoroughly disgusting.

Are you appalled by someone’s sordid, despicable, ugly and just generally awful behavior? Then
it’s probably vile, too. One of those dramatic adjectives with many synonyms, the word vile is not
only used to describe a person or an action that is morally reprehensible; it can describe a smell
that is so bad as to be practically morally reprehensible — or something else that offends your
senses enough to make you nauseous. Those three month old dirty gym socks? They’re vile!
