When people are involved in a ceremony, they often behave in a solemn way, exhibiting the respect
they feel for the ritual. Their behavior can be described as ceremonious.

Don't confuse ceremonious with ceremonial. Ceremonial means by ceremony. If, after signing a peace
agreement, two presidents exchange a ceremonial handshake in front of reporters, that's different
from the ceremonious manner they maintain while doing so.
