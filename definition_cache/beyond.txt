Beyond is an adverb that means “in addition” or “farther along. If you’re headed to the silo
beyond the barn, that means you’re going to the silo that’s on the far side of the barn.

Beyond is related to the word yonder, which you might have heard in expressions like, “Over yonder
hill, you’ll see a picket fence.” Yonder kind of means “that one over there, in the
distance.” Beyond is past yonder. If you’re going above and beyond, it means you’re doing more
than was expected. If you’re beyond Kelly in your math homework, it means you’ve done more than
she has. And if the show was beyond your expectations, it was better than you had hoped.
