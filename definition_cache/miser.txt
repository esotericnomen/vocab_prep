A miser is someone who hoards his or her own wealth and doesn’t share or spend any of it. If you
remember the old saying “You can’t take it with you!” — then you won't end up acting stingy
like a miser.

The most famous fictional miser is probably Scrooge in Dickens’s A Christmas Carol. The image of
his shivering with cold while he counts his coins illustrates the misery often associated with
misers. To be a miser, your impulse to hoard means you won’t even indulge yourself by spending
money for fear of depleting your stash.
