Something that is yours forever, that can’t be taken away and given to your little brother
instead? That  something would be called inalienable. The word refers to a natural right that cannot
be revoked by an outside force.

The word inalienable is often linked to human rights — you’ve probably heard the term
“inalienable rights.” In the Declaration of Independence Thomas Jefferson (using the
<em>un-</em> variant) wrote that all men are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable
rights including life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.” The spelling may vary but the
meaning is clear: an inalienable right is something that can’t be given or taken away by a
government or another legal power.
