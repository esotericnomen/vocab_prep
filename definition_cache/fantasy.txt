A fantasy is something you imagine, which might involve dragons, unicorns, or an imaginary best
friend. If you live in a fantasy world, you're not worrying much about reality — pleasant, maybe,
but not very practical.

Fantasy is dreams and imagination. In a football fantasy league, you can create your own dream team.
In literature, fantasy — a genre similar to science fiction — might include a story about a
three-headed squirrel and a bionic aardvark who fall in love on a planet made entirely of
strawberries. Romance can be fantasy, too, according to a Billy Joel song: It's just a fantasy. It's
not the real thing. But sometimes a fantasy is all you need.
