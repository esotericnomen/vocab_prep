Do you have a determinate personal budget? Welcome to the club. So do most people, unless you happen
to be Warren Buffet or Bill Gates. Anything determinate has a fixed limit to it.

Slightly differently, determinate can also refer to something that has a clearly visible limit of
form. For example, although no two snowflakes are ever exactly alike, they all share a certain
determinate form, that is they all have six arms.
