A quest is all about seeking something important, and it often involves a journey. You would travel
the world in a quest for gold. You would not travel to the front of the lunchroom in a quest for
tater tots.

Knights in the Middle Ages were forever taking on questsâ&euro;&ldquo;â&euro;&ldquo;most famously
to find the Holy Grail. In modern times, you can quest without ever leaving home, thanks to the
Internet. A scientist might embark on a quest to find the cure for cancer. A detective might quest
for the truth.
