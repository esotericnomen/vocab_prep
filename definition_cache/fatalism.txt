People who exhibit fatalism appear powerless to shape their own future: they believe only in fate. I
sense the fatalism in you, but you CAN change things!

You can see and hear the word fate in the word fatalism. It means destiny — the notion that all
things are meant to be and that there is nothing you can do to change them. Someone fatalistic —
who displays fatalism — sees life as a series of inevitable, predetermined events. Often, this
term is used negatively to describe someone who refuses to try to shape their own lives or who gives
up too easily. Fatalism may in fact be logical response to life, but that's no reason not to try to
change things!
