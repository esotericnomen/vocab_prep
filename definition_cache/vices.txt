A vice is a moral failing or a bad habit. Traditional examples of vice include drinking alcohol,
smoking tobacco, and gambling in card games.

In the United States, municipal police departments often have a bureau dedicated to vice, manned by
vice cops, whose job it is to fight crime related to alcohol, drugs, and gambling. But anything can
be a vice, as long as there's someone out there who views it as bad behavior or a moral weakness.
You might say, casually, I don't drink, smoke, or gamble. Chocolate ice cream is my vice. Or driving
over the speed limit. Or intentionally failing to sort your recycling.
