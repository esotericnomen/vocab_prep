Though is fine conjunction. It's no but or however, though it is a useful word, when you want let a
reader know that two ideas are opposing one another.

There are two basic kinds of the so-called coordinating conjunctions: those that connect similar
thoughts — for example, and — and those that disconnect similar thoughts — for instance, but
and however. Though fits into the second category. For example Though Prince is considered 'older'
by rock-star standards, his concerts put those of most kids half his age to shame. The though in
that sentence gets its power from the comma at the midpoint, because that's where the two opposing
ideas meet. The word Though at the beginning tells us to look for that comma.
