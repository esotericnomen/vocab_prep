While a mood can change, your temperament is your overall tone most of the time. Just like dogs,
people have temperaments: some are aggressive; some are playful; and some are just happy to carry
your slippers.

Just as a temperature gives a reading of how hot or cold something is, your temperament gives a
reading of your disposition, or general outlook. Some folks with optimistic temperaments see that
glass as half full; other more pessimistic folks see it as half empty. And there are still others
who prefer to drink straight from the bottle.
