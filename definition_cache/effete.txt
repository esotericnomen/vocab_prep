Effete is a disapproving term meaning decadent and self-indulgent, even useless. The stereotype of
the rugged Westerner is just as false as the one of the effete East Coast liberal.

The origin of the word effete is a little unexpected. Coming from the Latin effetus out of, past
childbearing, effete meant exhausted, spent long before it acquired the sense of morally exhausted
and overly refined. This is the main use of the word today. Do you ever wonder why some effete party
girls are considered celebrities? Star athletes run the risk of losing their edge and becoming
effete posterboys for their sports.
