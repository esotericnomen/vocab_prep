Use the adjective crazy to describe actions that aren't sensible, like the crazy way your brothers
run around the house when their favorite team wins a game.

Crazy can also mean insane, though in today's world, it is offensive to apply it to those who
struggle with mental illness. Instead, stick with using crazy to describe temporary and more light-
hearted situations like being crazy about a new boyfriend or girlfriend or going football crazy
during the Super Bowl.
