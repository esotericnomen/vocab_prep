You're most likely to hear the word executor in an attorney's office, since it means a person who is
legally responsible for ensuring that a will's directions are followed.

The executor of a will is in charge of making sure that people listed as beneficiaries
â&euro;&rdquo; in other words, the people who inherit money or property â&euro;&rdquo; receive
what has been willed to them. When writing a will, most people will choose a responsible adult to be
executor. The Latin root, executionem, means an accomplishing or a carrying out.
