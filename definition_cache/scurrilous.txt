If something is scurrilous, it's meant to offend. Scurrilous rumors can give you a bad rep, and
scurrilous stories sell tabloid magazines.

If something is scurrilous, it doesn't necessarily mean it isn't true: that celebrity may well be
pregnant, on drugs, or getting divorced â&euro;&rdquo; or possibly all three â&euro;&rdquo; but it
does suggest a certain indifference to the truth on the part of the person being scurrilous.
