Use the noun grandeur to describe something that is splendid or magnificent, such as a lofty idea or
an impressive building: “The gilded domes and ornate detail added to the grandeur of the church on
Red Square.”

Derived from the Old French word grand (meaning “great”), the word grandeur is used to describe
things that are distinguished, extraordinary, and impressive in scope. Consider the French origins
of grandeur as a clue and note that this is a fancy word, best saved for describing things that are
truly magnificent on a large scale. The simple beauty of a shadow’s pattern on a sidewalk probably
doesn’t have grandeur, but a sunset over the Rocky Mountains probably does.
