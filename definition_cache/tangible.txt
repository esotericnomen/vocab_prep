When you can touch something, it's tangible: I need tangible proof that aliens exist â€” I want to
shake their little green hands!

Tangible is from Latin tangere to touch, and it simply means something that can be touched or felt,
though it can be used in metaphorical senses: tangible assets have a value that can be precisely
measured, and tangible grief can be clearly sensed by an onlooker. So you might not need to
physically touch something for it to be tangible, but it has to be grounded in the real world of
facts: Has the teen pop star demonstrated any tangible ability to sing?
