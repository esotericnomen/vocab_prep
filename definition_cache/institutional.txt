Something institutional is what you'd expect from a big entity like a college or corporation, such
as the institutional cinder-block dorm room walls or the institutional policy of giving employees 10
sick days per year.

Accent the third syllable in institutional: in-stih-TOO-shun-ul. The word institutional can be used
to describe something related to an organization or a corporation, like institutional reform or
institutional policies. Something that's institutional is often thought of as bland or boring, like
the institutional food served to hospital patients. Institutional things often share, for better or
worse, a certain sameness.
