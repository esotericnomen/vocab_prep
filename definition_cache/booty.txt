Booty is treasure — money, jewels, and the like — obtained by criminal means, especially
plundering or pillaging. If you're in the Caribbean on vacation, you could spend some time looking
for buried pirate booty.

Although booty originally meant stolen goods from war or pirating activities, the term is now
sometimes used more generically to mean any riches or treasure. Although you may feel as though you
plundered your own bank account to buy new clothes for yourself, all the booty you brought home from
the mall might make you decide that it was worth it.
