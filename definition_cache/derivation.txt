Derivation is fancy word for the origin or root of something.

Derivation is most often used in reference to abstract concepts Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; such as words, names
or ideas. The derivation of the word derivation is the Latin derivationem, meaning a leading off or
turning away from. For the origin of more physical things, we tend to use root or source: Stanley
wasn't looking for the derivation of the Nile; he was looking for its source.
