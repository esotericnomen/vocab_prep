A misogamist is a marriage-hater. Your confirmed bachelor friend — who swears he'll never get
married — might just like his independence, or he might be a misogamist.

If you describe yourself as a misogamist, you probably don't accept many wedding invitations, and
you certainly won't be getting married any time soon yourself. Some misogamists might hate the idea
of being married, while others object to the entire institution of marriage. The key to the word's
meaning lies in misos, the Greek word for hatred, here combined with gamos, or marriage.
