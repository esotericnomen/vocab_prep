On a whim, he sold everything and left the city for the beautiful wilderness of Alaska, but his act
of caprice felt a lot less whimsical when he realized how freezing cold Alaska is.

The word caprice has its roots in the French for whim, which comes from the Italian word capriccio
for fright or sudden start. A caprice can be just a fun impulsive act, but it also can be something
done on a quick whim, without thinking it through or preparing for the change in direction. Having a
sudden liking, or caprice, for someone or something can be short-lived too.
