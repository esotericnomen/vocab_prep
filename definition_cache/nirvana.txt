Nirvana is a place of perfect peace and happiness, like heaven. In Hinduism and Buddhism, nirvana is
the highest state that someone can attain, a state of enlightenment, meaning a person's individual
desires and suffering go away.

The origin of the word nirvana relates to religious enlightenment; it comes from the Sanskrit
meaning extinction, disappearance of the individual to the universal. Achieving nirvana is to make
earthly feelings like suffering and desire disappear. It's often used casually to mean any place of
happiness, like if you love chocolate, going to Hershey's Park would be nirvana. On the other hand,
if you're a Buddhist monk, it may take you years of meditating to reach nirvana.
