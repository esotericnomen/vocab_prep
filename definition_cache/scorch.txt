To scorch is to burn something fiercely, to the point where its surface — your face, prairie
grass, a steak on the grill — chars or otherwise changes color.

Although scorch usually refers to burning something (whether it's the sun or a blowtorch doing the
burning), that's not always the case. An army can scorch an enemy territory — meaning raze
everything in sight, without technically setting it on fire. Scorch can also mean to quickly
overpower something or somebody, as in: We're gonna scorch the other team tomorrow.
