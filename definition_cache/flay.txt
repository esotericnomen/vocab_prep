Nasty word, flay. It means to peel or beat the skin of a person or animal, and not necessarily a
dead one, either. Nowadays it more commonly means to criticize harshly someone or something, usually
in public, leaving them raw and wounded.

To be flayed alive was a common punishment in ancient times for political enemies or traitors. The
ancient Assyrians and the Chinese were particularly good at it. Today, if you want to have your skin
â&euro;&rdquo; metaphorically â&euro;&rdquo; peeled in public, you go on reality TV. It can be
equally nasty.
