An impudent person is bold, sassy, and shameless. If you want to get into a fancy nightclub and you
tell the bouncer, “Let me in, I’m much more beautiful than all these ugly losers in line,”
that’s impudent behavior.

Impudent comes from the Latin combination of im, meaning without, and pudens, meaning shame. We
often call someone impudent if they’re disrespectful, snotty, or inappropriate in a way that makes
someone feel bad. If you know someone has just lost all their money on the stock market, don’t be
impudent and ask them how they’re going to afford gas money for their yacht.
