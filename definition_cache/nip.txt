A nip is a tiny bite, a cold feeling, or a strong taste on your tongue. It’s also a verb for
pinching or biting something, but not always in a bad way.

Being nipped now and then isn’t a big deal. If a puppy nips your finger, no worries. The cold
morning nip when you get out of bed is uncomfortable, but put on socks and you’re fine. Nipping
can be a good thing sometimes, like in the phrase “nip it in the bud,” which means stopping a
poor behavior or activity when it first starts. A nip can also mean a small sip of something, like
hot chocolate — which is a good idea if you’re feeling a nip of a cold draft.
