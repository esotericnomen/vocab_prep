If you do something in a grudging manner (or grudgingly), you do it with reluctance. Doing homework,
paying taxes, and saying sorry are all commonly done in a grudging manner.

Grudging apology and grudging acceptance are probably the two most common uses of this word, which
perhaps says something about our lack of grace as a species. From the medieval French word groucher,
meaning to murmur or mumble. A related word is grudge, meaning a long-lasting sense of ill will
dating to a previous incident.
