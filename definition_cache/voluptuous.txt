Voluptuous describes a woman that's large — but in all the right places. Voluptuous is a curvy
compliment.

A skinny woman is the opposite of voluptuous. Being voluptuous means being a little fleshy and
curvy, especially in the chest area. But voluptuous doesn't only apply to body types. A house that's
luxurious, lavishly decorated, and full of delicious food is voluptuous. Any use of voluptuous means
there's a lot going on. For some reason, most fashion models are not voluptuous at all — they're
thin as a rail.
