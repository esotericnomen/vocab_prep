Recognition is when you remember something or someone you're familiar with — like the flash of
recognition you experience at your high school reunion.

Recognition isn't just about remembering what something looks like — it's also used to describe
when you remember that someone has done something special, and decide to recognize their efforts
with an award or speech. This type of recognition is a form of acknowledgment, a way to say we
approve or good work!
