A lineament is a fancy, literary word that means a part of a person's face, like his eyes, ears, or
nose.

In his poem Manfred, Lord Byron wrote, She was like me in lineaments — her eyes / Her hair, her
features, all...  He was basically saying that a particular woman's face looked a lot like his own
face, when he examined each part of it — each lineament — separately. The word comes from the
Latin word linea, meaning line. Lineaments can also refer to someone's distinctive features, not
just their looks.
