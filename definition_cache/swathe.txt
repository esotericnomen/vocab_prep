When you swathe yourself in a blanket, you are wrapping or swaddling yourself up in it. Swathe a
baby up and you're creating a little cocoon where she can sleep.

The word swathe can also be spelled swath. When spelled with an e, it is pronounced like the word
bathe. When you bathe, you immerse yourself in water and when you swathe yourself, you immerse or
bundle yourself in blankets.  Commonly, this word can be used to talk about how you might wrap a
baby up, but it's also the word for a long strip or bandage to protect a wound.
