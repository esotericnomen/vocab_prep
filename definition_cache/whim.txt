A whim is an odd or fanciful idea, something kooky you suddenly decide to do, like dress up like a
chicken or drive to Vegas.

A whim can be a sudden impulse or a change of mind, like if you go shopping for school clothes but
instead buy a pink cowboy hat. Whim is a shortened version of the equally silly sounding whim wham
which means fanciful object, like a tiny snow globe that plays Hava Nagila. If you go for a drive on
a whim, you could wind up anywhere, perhaps even back to the store to return that snow globe.
