To retard something is to slow it down. This is also a mean and inappropriate word for someone who's
mentally slow.

This word should be used with a lot of caution. Calling someone who's mentally retarded
â&euro;&rdquo; or of low intelligence â&euro;&rdquo; a retard is considered very offensive by many
people. That use should be avoided. On the other hand, this is a harmless word when used as a verb.
While skiing, a heavy, bulky jacket could retard your progress down the mountain. Keeping a plant
out of sunlight would retard its growth. When you see retard, think slow and Use with caution.
