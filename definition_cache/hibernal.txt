Use the adjective hibernal to describe something that has to do with winter, like a grizzly bear's
cozy hibernal cave.

You can talk about anything wintry as being hibernal â&euro;&rdquo; like the snow-covered hibernal
woods â&euro;&rdquo; but it most often describes an animal that hibernates during the coldest
months. For example, a chipmunk's long, deep winter nap can be called a hibernal sleep. The root of
hibernal is the Latin word hibernalis, which means wintry, from the root hiems, winter.
