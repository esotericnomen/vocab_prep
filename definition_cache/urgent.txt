If something is urgent it requires immediate attention or action. If you break your leg, you'll need
urgent attention at the hospital â€” that means the  doctors will tend to you without delay.

Urgent comes from the Latin word urgentem, meaning to press hard, urge.  You can see that urgent
contains the word urge, meaning to demand or insist. When you get an urgent message, you need to
drop what you're doing to deal with it. An urgent need, like hunger, is a pressing one. If you're a
music fan, you might know the song Urgent by the band Foreigner. The song's lyrics make it fast,
make it urgent and its frenetic style help define the word.
