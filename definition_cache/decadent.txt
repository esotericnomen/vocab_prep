If your friend vacations in lavish hotels, wears thousand-dollar shoes, and refuses to eat cheese
that costs less than $20 an ounce, you might say her lifestyle is decadent.

A decadent is a person who has fallen into a state of moral or artistic decay. Typically, though, we
use decadent as an adjective to describe wasteful indulgence or extravagance. Celebrities who find
themselves unable to manage sudden fame and fortune sometimes go overboard, throwing million-dollar
parties, living the fast life, turning to drugs and alcohol. And because they're famous, we read
about them and their decadent lifestyles in the tabloid papers.
