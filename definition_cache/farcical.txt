Something that's farcical is ridiculously funny — absurd, even. When you stumbled onstage,
tripping over your costume and pulling down the backdrop, you brought a farcical element to the
serious play.

If it resembles a farce — a silly comedy that pokes fun at something — you can describe it as
farcical, which is pronounced FAR-cih-kul. Farcical comes from the Latin farcire, to stuff, which
influenced the French farce, a comic interlude in a mystery play. It's thought that farce came to
have this meaning because it was stuffed in between acts.
