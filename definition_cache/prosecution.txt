You know the lawyers who try to make the jury believe the guy on trial for stealing the bananas
actually stole the bananas? That team of lawyers is known as the prosecution.

The entire process of trying to convict someone of a crime is known as the prosecution, and if
convicted, you may face prosecution. Any words with the root prosecute are connected to trying to
prove someone’s guilt. You might often hear about the prosecution's case — that's their
evidence. Or you might hear about a prosecution witness — someone who is supposed to tell jury
members something that will convince them of the defendant's guilt.
