A misnomer is a wrong or unsuitable name. It’s a misnomer to call your grandmother
“Grandfather,” the same way it’s a misnomer to call a chair with four legs that doesn’t move
unless you drag it across the floor, a rocking chair.

From the Middle-French misnomer “to misname” evolved our English misnomer, a noun indicating a
lack of fit when it comes to naming. Synonyms include, predictably, misnamed, but also mistermed and
miscalled. You’ll notice the repetition of the mis- at the front of all those words. It comes from
the French mes-, which means “wrongly.”
