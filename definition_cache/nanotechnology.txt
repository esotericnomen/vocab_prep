Nanotechnology is a science that deals with extremely tiny things, especially individual atoms and
molecules.

Nanotechnology is a branch of engineering concerned with building and manipulating extremely tiny
things: things that are smaller than 100 nanometers. If that sounds small, it certainly is: a
nanometer is a billionth of a meter. When scientists are working at this level, they are dealing
with atoms and molecules. Science fiction has featured tiny creatures such as nanobots, but the real
world of nanotechnology increasingly includes breakthroughs in the areas of energy, vaccines,
computers, and food production.
