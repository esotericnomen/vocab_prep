It's hard to lounge, or recline comfortably, in the lounge, or waiting area, of an airport terminal.
Maybe they shouldn't call it a lounge.

Lounge comes from the French s'allonger meaning to lounge about, lie at full length. Whether you're
talking about a room with seats in a hotel made for waiting, or a nice comfy sofa, or the act of
reclining comfortably, lounge has everything to do with making yourself comfortable in one spot for
a while. It also means to hang around in an easy way, the way you might lounge around the poolside
area in a luxury hotel.
