Say you're playing a role-playing game and you end up in one of the other player's dungeons.  You
could try begging him for clemency â€” compassion shown by people in power towards people who rebel
or break the law.

Clemency is also a weather word, though nowadays it's much more common to hear people talk about
inclement weather than, say, the clemency of the storm. Derived from the Latin for gentle, it came
into usage in the 1550s. If you have trouble remembering its meaning, get rid of the cle and replace
the n with an r. You're left with mercy, which more or less means the same thing.
