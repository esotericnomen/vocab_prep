An obeisance is an act, usually physical, showing dutiful obedience. A supplicant might perform
obeisance, touching his face to the ground, before humbly asking for help.

Obeisance is often used in historical or religious contexts and often refers to bowing or kneeling.
Figuratively, it means an act of respect though sometimes with the negative connotation of slavishly
doing as expected. Your boyfriend might bring you and your mother flowers in obeisance to the idea
that the parents should be courted as much as the child. Consumers who want this software must show
