An orifice is an opening or a hole, most often in the body, such as your mouth or your nostril.

We most often use orifice to describe a natural opening in our bodies, but it can an opening into
any cavity, such as a hollowed out tree trunk, or the vent of a heating system. Other definitions of
orifice include a type of nozzle used in plumbing applications and a plate used to measure the flow
of liquid.
