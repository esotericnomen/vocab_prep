A person giving a speech is called an orator, like the gifted orator who raised excellent points,
making everyone in the audience want to join his revolution.

The noun orator traces back to the Latin word orare, meaning to “speak before a court or assembly,
plead.” Orator is really just a formal way of saying “speaker.” Technically, you can use it to
describe anyone who is giving a speech, whether it’s a speaker at the United Nations or a
classmate giving a short presentation. However, orator often implies that the speaker is
particularly gifted.
