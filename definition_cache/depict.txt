When you depict something, you draw a picture of it, describe it or show what it looks like. So grab
a crayon, a paint brush, or even an Etch-A-Sketch and start depicting.

From the Latin depictus, meaning â&euro;&oelig;to portray, paint, sketch, describe,â&euro;? depict
is a way to communicate what you see. To explain to an alien what a banana is, you can either depict
it with drawings, describe it in words, or both. But be careful. Writes author Joyce Maynard, The
painter who feels obligated to depict his subjects as uniformly beautiful or handsome and without
flaws will fall short of making art.
