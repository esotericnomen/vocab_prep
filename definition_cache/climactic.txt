Something that is the highest or most exciting point is climactic. This adjective is used to
describe a scene, event, or action. If you enjoy a good mystery, you probably love the climactic
ending, when you find out whodunnit.

Climactic describes the grand finale or the top point of a series of events, and it comes from the
word climax. The climactic scene in The Wizard of Oz is when Dorothy and friends face the Wicked
Witch of the West, for example. When you finally reach the top of a mountain, you’re at the
climactic point! Realizing that mountain’s just a landfill, well, that’s anticlimactic.
