The verb plummet means to drop sharply, like eagles that plummet toward earth, seeking prey, or
school attendance that plummets when there is a flu outbreak.

To correctly pronounce plummet, say PLUH-met. This verb describes something that drops sharply or
quickly, like a roller coaster that plummets down a hill, temperatures that plummet overnight, or
sales of roses and candy that plummet after Valentine's Day. If something plummets, this doesn't
mean it will stay down or low forever, just that it has experienced a sharp drop.
