Something homespun has a simple, coarse feel, like your homespun plan to bring about world peace by
giving everyone a daily spoonful of your aunt’s delicious strawberry jam.

Homespun literally means spun at home. If you spin the wool from your sheep into yarn, and then make
a dress out of it, it won’t be as fine or precise as fabric spun in a factory. Back in the day
when large portions of the population couldn't afford milled cloth, homespun fabric marked you as
poor, or just a farmer living off the land. Today we use homespun to describe anything that seems
homemade, simple, or folksy, from homespun linens to homespun philosophies of life.
