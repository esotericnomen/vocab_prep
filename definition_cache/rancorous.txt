The adjective rancorous comes in handy when you're describing someone's bitter grudge, like the
attitude of your cousin who still won't speak to you after the April Fool's Day prank you played
four years ago.

A story can be rancorous, if it's full of resentment, and so can an argument, if it's particularly
bitter and angry. The word rancorous can be traced back to the Latin word rancere, which means to
stink. This in turn led to rancorem, bitterness or rancidness. When you speak to your arch enemy and
your words are so angry and bitter that they almost stink, go ahead and describe them as rancorous.
