Rotund describes anything that's plump or round, like a teapot or your chubby Aunt Agnes.

Rotund describes someone who is round in shape, or obese. It's not a compliment. That's why it's
probably okay to call Santa Claus rotund, but not your neighbor Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; at least not to his
face! It's fine to call round things rotund, however, like a rotund vase full of flowers, which
particularly makes sense when you know that the root of rotund is the Latin word rotundus,  meaning
round, circular, like a wheel.
