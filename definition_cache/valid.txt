A valid argument is one that is well-grounded in fact, law or logic. Their argument for annulment
was valid because they had never even met and their marriage was the result of a clerical error at
town hall.

Something is valid when it can be supported or backed-up, or if it is functional: “She figured her
password was valid because she had just set it.”  In a legal context, valid means that something
is binding or actionable: “At the time of the accident his license was no longer valid, so they
impounded his car.”  The logical grounding of an argument can be valid: “That’s a valid point
about Santa being too large to fit down a chimney.”
