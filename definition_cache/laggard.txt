Hey pokey! Yeah you, Mr. Slow Pants. Quit your dawdling! This is no time to be a laggard, or someone
who's always lagging behind.

So who was the bigger laggard Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; the tortoise or the hare? Well that turtle sure was
slow moving, but at least he continued at a steady pace. The hare was speedy, but took more time
than necessary, goofing around and falling behind. It's a tough call, and one that the literary
community has totally been dragging their feet on. What a bunch of laggards!
