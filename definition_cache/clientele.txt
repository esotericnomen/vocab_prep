Your customers are your clientele. If you own a pet food store, your clientele might be two-footed
and four-pawed.

The noun clientele is often preceded by an adjective to describe the exact type of customer. Little
boutiques in upscale neighborhoods probably cater to an exclusive clientele, while the kids' hair
salon might have Barney on video to keep the young clientele motionless in their chairs. Regardless
of business type, you are always trying to please the clientele.
