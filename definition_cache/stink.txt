When things stink, they smell terrible. If you throw food scraps in your kitchen trash can, it will
eventually start to stink.

You can say that something stinks â&euro;&rdquo; your dog's breath, or your brother's feet
â&euro;&rdquo; and you can call the offensive odor itself a stink. Figuratively, something can
stink even if it doesn't literally smell bad: I'm sorry, but that movie you recommended really
stinks. It's awful. The Old English root is stincan, emit a smell of any kind, or exhale.
