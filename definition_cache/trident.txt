If you’re the ancient Greek god of the sea, you’re probably already familiar with a trident, a
three-pronged spear you can use to stab things.

The trident, which is a spear with three points, or prongs, is often associated with the Greek god
Poseidon, who used his trident to cause earthquakes and create sources of water. Mere mortals,
however, are more likely to use a trident for spear fishing, or long ago, for military combat.
Remember not to confuse a trident with a pitchfork, which is used mainly for lifting and tossing
things.
