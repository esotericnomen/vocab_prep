The word corpuscle is a medical term for a living cell, such as a red blood cell.

You're most likely to come across the noun corpuscle in a biology class, since it means a small
cell, especially one that is free floating. Blood and lymph cells are both considered to be
corpuscles because they are suspended in liquid within the body. Sometimes the word is used to mean
simply a small piece of something, which is how corpuscle was originally used, rooted in the Latin
corpusculum, a puny body, an atom, or a particle.
