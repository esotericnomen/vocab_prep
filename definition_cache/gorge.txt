Your gorge refers to your throat, your stomach, and/or the passage between the two. Use this word
figuratively when you want to indicate disgust. Your gorge will most likely rise at the sight of the
roasted monkey knuckles.

Think of your stomach when you use gorge as a verb because it means to overeat. You may enjoy
gorging on ice cream and chocolate while you're eating it, but the stomachache afterword won't be
very pleasant. Gorge can also mean a narrow passage between mountains or cut into rock ledges. A
bumper sticker promoting upstate New York reads, â&euro;&oelig;Ithaca is gorges.â&euro;? This is a
play on the word gorgeous, meaning beautiful, and the beautiful ravines in the area.
