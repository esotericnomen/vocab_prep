Nowadays, we mostly think of a coach as someone who trains a team, but it can also refer to a
vehicle, such as a horse-drawn coach or coach bus (the kind with a bathroom in the back).

The first meaning of coach was in the mid-16th Century for a carriage, probably named for Kocs, the
Hungarian village where they were first made and called kocsi. In the mid-19th Century, the name was
given to railway cars, and nowadays the least expensive travel class is described as coach. It's
thought that the idea of a coach as a teacher came about because of the idea that a coach carries a
student to success through his or her teaching.
