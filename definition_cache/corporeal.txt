Use the adjective corporeal to describe something that has to do with the body, like when your
teacher catches you daydreaming and says you need to bring your mental sharpness, not just your
corporeal presence to the classroom.

Corporeal describes something that has a physical form. It is the opposite of spiritual or
emotional. Something that is corporeal exists in the real world. Itâ&euro;&trade;s sort of a fancy
way of saying bodily or physical. So when you crave double-cheese pizza with sausage and pepperoni,
you could blame it on a corporeal need. (Itâ&euro;&trade;s a way to make junk-food cravings sound a
little bit grand!)
