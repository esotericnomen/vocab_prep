Lucky you! Apprehension has three meanings: 1) the capture of a criminal; 2) the understanding of an
idea; 3) a fear, doubt, or misgiving.

Given the crook's record of evading arrest, the chief had real apprehensions about being able to
catch him again. Eventually though, he lost those misgivings and activated the whole police force in
an effort to ensure the felon's apprehension. And it paid off! They caught him red-handed. But it
wasn't until he saw the video of the crime in progress that the guy apprehended just how much
trouble he was in. It was that apprehension that led him to make a deal with the district attorney.
