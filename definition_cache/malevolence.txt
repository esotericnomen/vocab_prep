Malevolence is a nasty, wicked, evil quality. When you're full of malevolence, you wish harm on
others.

Translated from the Latin, malevolence means to wish for bad things Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; to have ill
will. What sets malevolence apart from other kinds of hatefulness is that it implies a deliberate
wish for evil. A small child might be mean out of anger or spite, but probably not out of
malevolence. Malevolence requires more thought: it's a deeper, more profound kind of badness often
associated with devils and villains.
