Something commonplace is ordinary. It can also be something dull and unchallenging or tired and
clichéd. Coffee shops in cities are commonplace, so are berets in Paris. You see them all over the
place.

Things that are common can be found all over the place — they're commonplace! The word is a
literal translation of the Latin locus communis for general topic. Commonplace things and behavior
are ordinary. For example, a commonplace job is a boring, mind-numbing task. It’s humdrum and
unglamorous. A commonplace word or saying is a cliché — it's so common that it becomes
meaningless and annoying.
