A strong desire to travel is called a wanderlust. If you dream of backpacking through Europe, you
have a wanderlust. (You probably also have unwashed dreadlocked hair and a wardrobe nearly entirely
made of fleece. If not, you will soon.)

The Germans call the strong urge for travel wanderlust, literally a desire for wandering. We loved
the German efficiency of the word so much we annexed it for our own language. With a word like lust
inside it, wanderlust really captures the dreamy passion travelers all share. Sometimes the word is
also used for people who can't make a commitment to a job or a relationship.
