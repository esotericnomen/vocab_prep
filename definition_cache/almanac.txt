An almanac is an annual publication devoted to the facts and statistics of a given subject.  You
might consult a sports almanac for the coming year's scheduled games, or information on your
favorite (or least favorite) player.

The background of the noun almanac is somewhat hazy, with some suggesting it came from the Greek
almenichiakon and others suggesting it came from the Spanish-Arabic al-manakh, both meaning
calendar. The astronomical almanac was once a book of permanent tables, with the annual version
appearing in the 16th Century. Perhaps the most famous almanacs were Benjamin Franklin's Poor
Richard's Almanac, and the Farmer's Almanac, published continuously since 1792, which offers weather
predictions as well as astronomical tables and gardening tips.
