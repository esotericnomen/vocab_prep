If you've ever camped under a wooden lean-to, you know what a hut is â€” it's a simple, usually
temporary shelter that doesn't do much more than keep the rain off your head.

A hut can be built from many different materials, including wood, stone, snow, or even cardboard.
What all huts have in common is a simple design and the intention that it provide a short-term
shelter from the weather. Campers, hikers, and skiers often rest or sleep in huts. The word comes
from the French hutte, cottage, which has its root in the Old English word for to hide, hydan. Hut
was originally used in English to describe military dwellings.
