Jobs being cut? Houses not selling? Everyone talking about the poor sales of everything from cars to
bouquets of flowers? That's a recession, a time of economic decline.

Recession comes from the Latin word recessus, meaning a going back, retreat. Think of all the things
that get made and sold in a country. When fewer people buy things, orders for them slow down. The
sales go back to a lower amount. This is an economic recession. This noun can also describe other
kinds of going back, like the recession of floodwaters that enable people to begin cleaning up their
homes that had been filled with water.
