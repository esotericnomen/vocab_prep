To jibe with someone is to agree with them. Jibe can also mean “be compatible with or similar
to.” If two people jibe, they get along quite well.

A jibe can also be an insulting remark as another way to spell gibe. If someone directs that kind of
jibe at you, the best response is a really good comeback. And in nautical terminology, jibe refers
to a particular manner of changing the course of a ship. How did this word come to have such
different meanings? Your guess is as good as ours. Just try to remember that if you want to jibe
with others, don’t insult them.
