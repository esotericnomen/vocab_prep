Pull out your galoshes. When it's been raining for days, there are puddles everywhere, and the grass
is thoroughly soaked, it's safe to say the ground is sodden.

Coming from the Middle English word for boiled, sodden is certainly closely tied with lots and lots
of liquid. Saturated, soppy and soaking, anything that's sodden is drenched to the core and probably
a mess. That goes for people, too: You can call someone sodden if they're acting stupid or dull,
especially if they've had too much to drink.
