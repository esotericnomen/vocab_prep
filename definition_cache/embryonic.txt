If something is described as embryonic, it's just starting to develop or come together. An embryo is
a person or animal that is still growing in the womb or egg, and embryonic means like an embryo.

The idea for Facebook was still embryonic when its creators agreed to be partners. At that early
stage, none of them could have imagined what an enormous company it would become. Scientists working
on embryonic stem-cell research are working on stem cells from embryos, which have special
properties not found in any other cells. Our relationship was still embryonic when you suggested we
move in together, but for me, the first date is way too early to think about such things.
