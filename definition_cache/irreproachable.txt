Use the adjective irreproachable to describe something or someone blameless or not deserving of
criticism. It can be annoying, but your parents strive to give you irreproachable advice when they
tell you, Study hard in school, and not Party on!

The adjective irreproachable comes the Old French word reprocher, which meant to blame. With the
addition of the prefix ir-, meaning not, and the suffix -able, meaning capable, we get the English
meaning of not capable of being blamed. It is the rare politician who has an irreproachable
reputation. So if your background is not irreproachable and you run for office, be prepared for the
press to dig up all the skeletons in your closet.
