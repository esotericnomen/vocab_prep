The verb ramify describes something that branches off or spreads, like the new subway lines that
ramify across your city and reach even the neighborhoods farthest from the center.

Ramify came into English through French, but it traces all the way back to the Latin word ramus,
meaning branch. It can describe things that literally branch out in segments, or it can be used
figuratively to describe things that spread, like the effects of a new policy that ramify through
your school. Ramify might seem like a strange word, but you probably know the related word
ramification, a consequence that stems â&euro;&rdquo; or branches â&euro;&rdquo; from some other
action.
