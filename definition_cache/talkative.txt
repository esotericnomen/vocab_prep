A person who is talkative likes to talk — she's friendly and ready to gab at all times about just
about anything.

We all have conversations, but some people enjoy talking more than others: those people are
talkative. They find it easy to strike up a conversation, unlike others who may be shy. Being
talkative is associated with being friendly. Talkative people can also be described as chatty,
garrulous, loquacious, talky, and likely to talk your ear off. If you don’t feel like chatting,
you'd better avoid talkative people. The root word of talkative is the Middle English tale, or
story.
