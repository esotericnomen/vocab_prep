You've got big ideas. Crazy ideas. But forward thinking ideas â€” ideas that just might change the
way the world works. You're considered a visionary.

Visionaries are ahead of their time, always thinking creatively. You could say that a visionary can
envision what the future holds and come up with solutions that fit that picture. Those wild ideas
aren't always met with appreciation though. Skeptics think that visionaries aren't grounded in
reality. And usually the visionaries tell them to stop being so shortsighted!
