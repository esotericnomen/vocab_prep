To resound is to echo with sounds, usually loudly. When you sing in the shower, your voice resounds.

If you remember that re means again, then resounding makes a lot of sense: it's what happens when a
sound rings out or echoes. A loud, booming voice is more likely to resound than a little whisper. If
you stand on a building, yell your name, and then here it again, it resounded. Resounding is also
called echoing, ringing, and reverberating. If you've ever heard a ring announcer, the microphone
helps his or her voice resound to the crowd.
