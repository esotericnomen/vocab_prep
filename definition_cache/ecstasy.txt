If you’ve ever been so happy that the rest of the world seemed to disappear, you’ve felt ecstasy
— a feeling or state of intensely beautiful bliss.

Ecstasy will make you want to write poetry. It happened to John Donne, whose poem “The Ecstasy”
is about the feeling of the whole world vanishing when he looks into his lover’s eyes.  Sometimes
artists see an epic landscapes that caused such ecstasy that they had to turn it into a painting.
Ecstasy can mean a feeling or it can also be a state of being, so you might say, “I’m in ecstasy
because this pumpkin pie tastes so delicious!”
