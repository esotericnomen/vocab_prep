Versification is when you turn something into a poem: The versification of this grocery list was a
lot harder than I imagined, because nothing rhymes with 'orange.'

You're most likely to come across the noun versification in an academic setting, like a poetry
class. You can use it to mean the adaptation of some other kind of writing into verse, or to talk
about the form -- meter, rhythm, or language -- of a poem. It comes from the Latin word
versificationem, and it's closely related to versify, whose root is versificare, compare verse or
turn into verse.
