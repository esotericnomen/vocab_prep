If you spin yourself around until you are dizzy, you will likely totter if you try to step forward.
Totter is a verb that means move unsteadily, as though you are about to fall down.

To totter is to move in a wobbly, unsteady manner. When a person totters, they look like they are
going to fall down. In a boxing match, a boxer might totter after taking a blow to the head. During
an earthquake, buildings may totter, or sway, appearing as though they may fall down. Totter can
also imply a rocking motion; a playground seesaw, for instance, is sometimes called a teeter-totter.
