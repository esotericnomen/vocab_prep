With the lines, Two households, both alike in dignity, Shakespeare begins the prologue to Romeo and
Juliet, setting up the idea of two families who hate each other before introducing the lovers in the
opening scene.

Like its buddy epilogue, which tells you what happens after the end of a story, a prologue is
concerned with setup of a story. As a prologue to what happened in the gym, I'll tell you about the
food fight in the cafeteria earlier that day.
