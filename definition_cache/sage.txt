Use the word sage for someone or something wise and judicious. Thanks to the sage advice of your
friend, you didn't write your teacher an angry e-mail!

Although you might think of a wizard when you hear the word sage, really it means a wise man. Today
you see it used to refer to someone who has insight in a particular field. If someone is a policy
sage, he knows just what advice to give politicians to make them understand the issue and respond
successfully to it. In a totally unrelated use, there is also a plant called sage that is useful in
home remedies and cooking.
