A spendthrift person is reckless and wasteful with his money. Spendthrifts who like to take you out
to nice lunches are good people to be friends with, but it's generally a bad way to handle your own
bank account.

Spendthrift was created by sticking two opposite words together: spend and thrift, which means
â&euro;&oelig;savings, wealth.â&euro;? So a spendthrift spends all of his savings. Spendthrift
people are the worst nightmare of retirement planners and Scrooges all over the globe. So unless you
want to be called a spendthrift, think twice about your next purchase.
