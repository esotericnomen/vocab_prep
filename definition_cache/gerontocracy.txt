A gerontocracy is a society governed by old people. Think: tribes where elders are esteemed for the
perspective and wisdom they have acquired in long years on the planet.

If your grandparents moved into your house and started telling everyone what to do, you might be
outraged. Daily Metumucil doses for everyone! No loud music or reading of novels written after the
First World War! A good thing then, that we live in a culture that worships
youthâ&euro;&ldquo;â&euro;&ldquo;we're unlikely to be ruled by a gerontocracy.
