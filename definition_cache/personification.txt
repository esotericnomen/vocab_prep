Personification means giving humans qualities to an abstract idea, as in a movie villain who is the
personification of evil.

You can use the noun personification in two ways. In the first, a person who is known for a certain
quality, like wisdom, is said to represent that quality in a way any can understand, like a patient,
generous person who is the personification of kindness. On the other hand, personification can give
human qualities to something that isn’t human. For example, you might say, “The sea is angry,”
assigning it a human emotion.
