You may think your fluffy white cat is just an innocent, or harmless, little kitty, but she shows no
mercy when attacking that toy mouse.

Innocent is an adjective that describes someone or something that is not harmful or at least
doesn’t cause harm on purpose. It can also be used when talking about a person who did not commit
a crime. “Innocent until proven guilty” is a phrase that means people who have been accused of a
crime should be considered innocent, or free of blame, unless a judge or jury decides that they are
officially guilty.
