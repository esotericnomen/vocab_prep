If something is thriving, it's doing well — so well you could call it booming. A thriving retail
business sees its products flying off the shelves.

The verb thrive means to flourish or grow vigorously, and it can be applied to something like a
business or to something or someone's actual health. Plants can thrive in a greenhouse, and children
can thrive if they eat well and exercise. Thriving can also be used more figuratively — The women
thrived on gossip; they loved knowing who was dating or divorcing whom.
