A cadet is a trainee enrolled in a military academy. You might also call a cadet a plebe, but
doesn't cadet sound so much better?

The term cadet has many meanings: the first meaning referred to a younger male in a family. That
might help you remember that a cadet is someone young: specifically, a student in a military
academy. In the United States, cadets are trainees at military colleges. The cadets get a college
education while also training to be officers in the armed forces. Being a cadet is a blend of
traditional education and military training.
