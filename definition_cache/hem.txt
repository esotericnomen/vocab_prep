When kids grow taller, their parents sometimes have to let out the hem in their pants so they'll be
long enough. The hem is the very bottom, folded edge of a piece of clothing.

Most of your clothes have at least one hem in them Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; at the ends of your sleeves, the
bottom of your skirt, or along the edge of your t-shirt. When a person sews a hem, whether he's
making a dress or a pair of curtains, he folds a very small amount of fabric under two or three
times and stitches along the edge in a straight line. In Old English, the word hem means a border.
