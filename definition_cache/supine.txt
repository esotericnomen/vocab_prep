One can be described as supine when lying face up (his favorite yoga poses were always the supine
ones); or, if one is very passive or lethargic (supine in the face of their threats and insults).

The adjective supine comes from a Latin word, supinus, which means “thrown backwards” or
“inactive.”  Whenever a person or animal is lying on its back, belly-up, it is supine.  When
your hand is open, palm-up, it is also supine.  Supine can even describe a person who gives
insufficient resistance, or who is lazy and ineffectual. When Jack refused to object to the
landlord’s repeated — and gouging — rent increases, he was supine.
