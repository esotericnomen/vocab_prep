Do you hear trumpets? With the word valor, you should. It was custom-ordered for a knight in
resplendent armor sitting atop his noble steed. Onward to deeds of valor!, you imagine him saying,
anticipating his own unfailing courage.

Valor is often displayed in the face of something designed to crush it, and it is often rewarded
with the conferring of a medal. I, King Dreyfus, award you this silver cup in honor of your deeds of
great courage. Your valor in the face of terrible danger must be recognized.
