If a dress is so see-through that light shines through it revealing the goods beneath, it's
diaphanous. Also known as sheer, transparent, or just plain sexy, but diaphanous is so much
classier.

If you want a classic example of diaphanous clothing check out all those nineteenth century Romantic
paintings of voluptuous Goddesses clad in clearly insufficient lightweight gowns flouncing around in
the middle of forests at night or storm-tossed fields. Those gowns are diaphanous all right, but
because it's a classical allusion there's obviously nothing naughty about it. From the ancient Greek
word diaphanes, meaning transparent Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; a style the Greeks were much in favor of.
