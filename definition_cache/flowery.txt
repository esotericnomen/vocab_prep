Something flowery either looks, smells, or feels like flowers. You might wear flowery perfume or
write a flowery poem starting with Roses are red... However, flowery is not a compliment when it
comes to writing.

If a blanket has a lot of pictures of flowers on it, it's flowery. If a scent reminds you of
flowers, it's flowery. Flowery things make you think of flowers in some way. Also, flowery things
are full of intricate details, maybe a little too full of them. A flowery speech might have many
figures of speech but very little content. A flowery building design has lots of little touches and
details. Flowery can mean something close to ornate.
