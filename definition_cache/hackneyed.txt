Hackneyed is a word for language that doesn't pack a punch since it's overused and trite. Roses are
red, violets are... — enough already?! That's hackneyed stuff.

Hackneyed is usually used to describe tired writing, but you can also refer to the hackneyed plots
of television sit-coms or the hackneyed jokes of your Uncle Fred. But, most often, you will see
hackneyed before the word phrase to refer to a specific cliché that is annoying the heck out of
someone.
