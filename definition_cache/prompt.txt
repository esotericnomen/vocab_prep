A prompt is a cue that gives forgetful actors a hint for their next line, or students the topic of
the essay they will write. It can also be the act of inspiring action, like your letter to the
editor that prompts others to join your cause.

When you prompt someone, you might offer a reminder, some assistance, or even inspiration to do
something. For example, honking your car's horn prompts your friend to get moving, or your standing
up for a classmate that prompts a bully to change his ways. When you prompt someone, you expect
action now. This sense of speediness is also found in the adjective form of prompt, as in the prompt
response that is required to win a contest.
