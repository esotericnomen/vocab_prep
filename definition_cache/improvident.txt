Someone who is improvident doesn't worry about the future â€” or plan wisely for it. If you spend
all your money on video games even though you know you have to buy your mom a birthday present next
week, you have made an improvident decision.

In the adjective improvident, the prefix im- means opposite or not. Provident comes from the Latin
word providere, meaning foresee, provide. Put that together and you get something that lacks
foresight and consideration for the future, like an improvident town council that spends the whole
budget on playground equipment, leaving nothing for cover inevitable repairs to fire trucks and
police vehicles.
