The neighborhood kids might use a tree house as a lookout, from which they can keep an eye out for
the local bully.

A lookout is usually so high that a person can see for a long distance in many directions when she
stands on or in it. Armies sometimes use lookouts to scout for approaching troops, and navy ships
include a lookout at the top of a tall mast, also called a crow's nest. Lookout can also be spelled
as a hyphenated word, look-out, and used as well to refer to the person whose job it is to stay in
the lookout and keep watch.
