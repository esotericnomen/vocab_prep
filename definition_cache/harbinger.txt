A harbinger is something that comes before and that shows what will follow in the future. The robin
is a harbinger of spring––its presence means spring is coming soon.

The appearance of a ghost is often thought of as a harbinger of death. Middle English herbergere is
from Old French herbergeor host, from herberge camp, shelter, a word ultimately borrowed from a
Germanic language.
