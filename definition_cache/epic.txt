An epic is a long poem or other work of art celebrating heroic feats. After you sail around the
world for seven years, fighting corruption and planting vegetable gardens, some poet will surely
write the epic of your adventures.

Epic comes from the Greek for song, because Greek poets like Homer sung their poems. We tend to use
epic for long, ambitious novels or movies, especially if they involve a long journey. Epic can be
used as an adjective to describe something historically important, lasting and complex. Perhaps your
great-grandfather was a soldier in the epic struggle of World War One. Your three day, sleepless
card poker game could be described as epic.
