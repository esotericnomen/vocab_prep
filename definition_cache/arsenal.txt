An arsenal is a storehouse for weapons. It wouldn't be wise to let your enemies get a hold of the
keys to your arsenal.

Not just a place to store weapons, an arsenal can be a place to make weapons or it can mean the
collection of weapons themselves: The air force had just added two top-secret fighter planes to its
arsenal. In a more general sense, the word can be a collection of anything used as a weapon, not
just military weapons: She had a whole arsenal of witty comebacks for the lame pickup-lines guys
tried out on her.
