When you make an inroad, you advance into new territory. An attacking army might try to make an
inroad into a neighboring country, for example.

Intruding in another's space or advancing into a previously inaccessible area are both examples of
inroads. The word is most often used in its plural form, like when your history teacher talks about
the great inroads women have made politically in the past fifty years. The noun inroad was
originally used only to talk about military movement, describing armies making hostile raids. The
road part of inroad evolved from the word ride, so the word comes from riding in.
