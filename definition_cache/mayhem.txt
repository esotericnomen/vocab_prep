Mayhem is a violent and rowdy disturbance, like what you might experience at an overcrowded rock
concert or a day-after-Thanksgiving sale.

You may encounter several types of disturbances in your life, but mayhem is typically used for
disturbances involving crowds. The word mayhem comes to us not from Latin, as many English words do,
but from Anglo-French, a dialect of French that developed in England several centuries ago.
We√¢&euro;&trade;re guessing those Anglo-French speakers had a reputation for being a pretty rowdy
bunch.
