A simulacrum is a fake version of something real. A wax museum is full of simulacrums of famous
people.

Simulacrum comes from the Latin word simulare meaning to make like and is related to words like
simulate (to imitate) and similarity. A simulacrum might look like a person, but it's usually a
sculpture. Also, a simulacrum can be a representation that's not very good. If you say, This video
game is only a simulacrum of playing football! that means it does a poor job of copying the game.
