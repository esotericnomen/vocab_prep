Stupid or inane behavior is imbecility. Picture a frat party gone wild, and you can picture
imbecility.

Foolishness that would be typical of an imbecile is imbecility. Imbecility is from the Latin
imbecillitatem, meaning â&euro;&oelig;weakness, feebleness.â&euro;? If you are feeble of mind or
weak on intellect and act accordingly, that is imbecility. For instance, you may have witnessed a
college party that was so rife with imbecility that you were amazed that the participants were
students in an institution of higher education.
