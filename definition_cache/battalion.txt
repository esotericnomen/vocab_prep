A battalion is a unit of an army. One battalion usually consists of three of more companies and a
headquarters.

The word battalion sounds a lot like battle, and that's a clue to its meaning: battalions are groups
engaged in a battle. Specifically, a battalion is a smaller segment of an army. Within a battalion,
there will usually be a headquarters, as well as a few smaller units, which are called companies.
The members of a battalion will work closely together, whether they are attacking an enemy or
defending a base. Veterans always remember the other soldiers in their battalion.
