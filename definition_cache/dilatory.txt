Something dilatory creates a delay. If you are a high school student, once in a while you might have
used dilatory tactics if you forgot to do your homework.

The adjective dilatory comes from the Latin root word dilator, a noun that means someone who puts
off things, or a procrastinator. If you are always late to appointments, people may accuse you of
being dilatory, especially if they think you don't have a good excuse.
