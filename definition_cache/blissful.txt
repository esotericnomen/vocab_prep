If you're blissful, you're happy and at peace. You can never have enough blissful moments.

If you're feeling blissful, then you're lucky. This is a word for total contentment and major
happiness, along with a kind of Zen-like peace. Good spa treatments should be totally blissful.
Getting an A in math or hitting a home run could make you feel blissful. A perfectly gooey piece of
chocolate cake could be pretty blissful. A blissful moment is full of joy and relaxation. Sounds
nice, doesn't it?
