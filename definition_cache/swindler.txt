If you know someone is a swindler, stay away from him. Swindlers are scammers who con people to make
a buck.

Unfortunately, there are many types of people in the world who will try to get your money. Somewhere
between a used car salesman and an outright thief is a swindler Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; someone who lies to
get your money, sometimes by suggesting you invest in something phony. Many people on the Internet
asking for money are swindlers, and if anyone tries to sell you a bridge, that's likely another
swindler. Swindlers are also called grifters, scammers, and con artists. The last person in the
world you should give money to is a swindler.
