A pang is a sharp jab or an intense hurt that comes on suddenly. If you've felt an all-of-a-sudden,
deep sadness that seems to hit you even in the back of the eyes, you've probably had a pang of
emotion over a loss or a tragic story.

You can feel a physical pain or pang right when you get hurt, or you might suffer a pang of guilt
that keeps popping up if you don't own up to something bad. Pang sounds close to pain, and it is
pain, but it has a sharper edge Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; it's intense and comes on fast. A childbirth pain
often is called a pang, because it's such a unique type of hurting. Having a pang of regret can be
almost as sharp.
