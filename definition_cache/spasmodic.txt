Something that is spasmodic is experiencing a fit, a loss of muscular control. If you are spazzing
out, you are spasmodic.

A sudden fit or involuntary contraction of the muscles is called a spasm; thus spasmodic means to
behave in such a way. Spasmodic is also commonly used to refer to a violent emotional outburst
Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; for example, your parents might be spasmodic when they discover you're really
majoring in partying, not medicine, at college.
