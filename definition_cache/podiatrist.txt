A podiatrist is a foot doctor. Got a bunion? A hammer toe? Call the podiatrist.

The word podiatrist is composed of two ancient Greek parts: pod, meaning foot, and iatrist, meaning
healer. Other kinds of doctors have a similar suffix: think psychiatrist Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; a doctor of
the mind. The pod prefix and suffix is used to name a number of things. For example, a camera tripod
has three feet. Pea pods and iPods? Nothing to do with feet!
