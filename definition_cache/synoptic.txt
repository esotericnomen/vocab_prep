If you’ve heard of a movie synopsis, which gives an overview of the plot, you can guess what
synoptic means: summarizing. At the end of your 900-page treatise on morals, try to give a synoptic
conclusion to drive your ideas home.

Synoptic can be broken down to syn-, meaning together, and -optic, meaning view or sight. So
something that is synoptic pulls everything together. At the end of a long day touring your great
aunt’s ancestral home, hearing endless stories about every dinner party she ever gave and all the
people that ever stayed there, you might synoptically comment, “Basically she cooks well and has
lots of fancy friends.”
