When someone persists they keep going or hang on. If you want finish a marathon, you have to persist
and keep running, no matter how many blisters you have.

The great Roman poet Ovid once advised: “Endure and persist, this pain will turn good by and
by.” As Ovid’s quote hints at, persistence is often associated with hardship and the reward that
comes with not backing down. Synonyms include endure, follow through, and persevere, while antonyms
include cease and give up.
