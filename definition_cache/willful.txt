Willful means deliberate or stubborn. A child who exhibits willful disobedience knows she is doing
something wrong (even if she tries to convince you otherwise).

While being full of will, or determination, doesn’t necessarily seem like a bad thing, the word
willful is negative in meaning. Use it when someone is behaving in a stubborn or uncooperative
manner. To describe someone who possesses dedication or perseverance in a positive sense, consider
determined, driven, or decisive — and that’s just the d's!
