You know that science experiment that used to be lunch that is now rotting in the back of your
fridge? Because it's decomposing and stinks to high heaven, you can call it putrid.

The adjective putrid describes something that is rotting and has a foul odor, but it can also
describe anything that is totally objectionable or exceptionally terrible. Something that is morally
corrupt or evil can also be described with putrid: The putrid politician took kickbacks for his vote
at work and cheated on his wife at home.
