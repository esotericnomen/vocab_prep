Capacity describes your ability to do something or the amount something can hold. If your bird cage
is at full capacity, you can't stuff one more feathered friend in there without causing a birdie
claustrophobia.

From the Latin word capacitatem meaning “breadth, capacity,” capacity is a noun that in the
simplest sense means ability or capability: the capability of a room to hold a certain number of
people, the ability of a law to change crime rates, your ability to pick up foreign languages. You
might hear about factories working at full capacity — that means at full speed, producing as much
as they possibly can.
