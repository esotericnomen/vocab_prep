An incubus is someone or something that really drags you down, like a so-called friend who only
calls you to complain about her life or a job that you can't stand.

Incubus comes from the Latin word incubo, meaning nightmare, one who lies down on (the sleeper),
which describes an evil spirit that crushes people in their sleep, triggering terrible nightmares
and making them feel like they're suffocating. In the Middle Ages, not only did people believe
incubi (yes, that's the plural) were real, they passed laws against these terrifying spirits.
