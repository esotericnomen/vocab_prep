Homeostasis is a word you learn in biology. It refers to a cell's home state––the way it wants
to be, and should be if everything that regulates the cell is working.

Although seeing stasis inside the word homeostasis might make you think there's something static or
still about it, there's not; homeostasis is only achieved through the running of complicated systems
in the body that regulate metabolic activity. Once all the poison had been flushed from the body,
the patient's cells began again to maintain homeostasis. The patient's color returned and she was
able to get out of bed.
