The adjective ferocious means more than merely angry or active. If you can imagine the wildest, most
savage animal ready to rip your arms off and shred the muscles, you would be imagining a ferocious
beast.

Although we most often think of the word ferocious as referring to wild animals, it can also be used
to describe anything characterized by an extremely high level of energy or even violence. Think of
it as the extreme opposite of peaceful. For example, sports fans at a soccer match often present a
ferocious appreciation of the game, sometimes to the point of destroying the stands or storming the
field to fight with the players!
