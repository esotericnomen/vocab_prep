Solitude is the state of being alone. You might crave solitude after spending the holidays with your
big, loud family — you want nothing more than to get away from everyone for a little while.

Solitude can also refer to a place where you're completely alone. The middle of the woods, the top
of a big mountain, the middle of a vast desert, even your room — these are places where you might
go for solitude. Solitude comes from the Latin word solitudinem, which means loneliness, but if you
have moments of solitude that doesn't necessarily mean you're lonely. The word solitude carries the
sense that you're enjoying being alone by choice.
