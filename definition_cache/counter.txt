A counter is a surface used for making transactions in a store or in a home kitchen for preparing
food. In a store, you pay for items at the counter.

When counter is a verb, it means to speak up in opposition, like when you counter your opponent's
argument in a debate. When something conflicts, you can say it runs counter to, like a fancy car
that runs counter to your philosophy of living simply. You can think of this meaning as in the
opposite direction, like counter-clockwise, meaning the direction that's opposite of clockwise.
