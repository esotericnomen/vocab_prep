Ever see a film about medieval knights killing one another? Well, the long stick with iron spikes at
the end they often used was called a mace. It’ll put quite a dent in your skull.

Because we’re all much more civilized now, we don’t use iron maces anymore, but police officers
and riot police do use a chemical spray called Mace, which has much the same effect. It was invented
in 1968, just in time to deal with pesky student agitators and the like. Get that in your eyes and
it’ll ruin your day.
