Someone who possesses wizardry is someone who is amazing at what they do, especially if what they do
requires creativity. You might rave about your sister's theatrical wizardry after she performs well
in the school play.

You might already know that a wizard is someone who has magical abilities. But a wizard can also be
someone who is really good at something. The class clown, for example, might secretly be a wizard at
chess. A way to talk about his exceptional skills would be to use the word wizardry. You might say
that his wizardry with the chessboard canâ&euro;&trade;t be topped â&euro;&rdquo; even by the
class nerd!
