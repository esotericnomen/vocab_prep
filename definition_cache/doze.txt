Are you sleepy? Maybe you need to doze a little. To doze is to sleep lightly or to take a nap.

To doze is to just have a little sleep: either a short nap or a very light snooze. Since doze and
snooze almost rhyme â&euro;&rdquo; and snoring sounds a little like ZZZZZZZZZZZ â&euro;&rdquo; the
letter Z might be a good way to remember this word. Just make sure you don't doze off in class.
