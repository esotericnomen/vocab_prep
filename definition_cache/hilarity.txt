Hilarity is that side-splitting, tear-inducing, laugh-until-you-can't-breathe happiness of a romping
good time.

There's usually an atmosphere of hilarity just after the ball drops on New Year's Eve. It's that
feeling of cheerfulness â&euro;&rdquo; hilaritas in Latin â&euro;&rdquo; that fills the room when
the clock strikes midnight. If your teacher passes out cupcakes and lets you play games instead of
reading aloud, she may have a hard time controlling the ensuing hilarity in the classroom.
