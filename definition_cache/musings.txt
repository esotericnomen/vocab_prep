Use the adjective musing to describe something that's reflective or thoughtful, like your musing
diary entry or a clown's sad, musing facial expression.

When you ponder or contemplate, you muse, and anything that appears this way can be described as
musing. You might love your English teacher's musing responses to students' questions or grow bored
by a French film's slow, musing quality. You can also use the word as a noun meaning period of
reflection, although it's most often written as the plural musings: This book is nothing but the
author's musings about his cat.
