Incarnate means “having a bodily form.” If you encounter someone who pulls off butterflies’
wings for fun, you might describe that person as “evil incarnate.”

The meaning of incarnate is precisely what its Latin roots suggest. The prefix in- means “in”
and caro means “flesh,” so incarnate means “in the flesh.” The word can be used in positive
or negative situations, but it always describes an unusual, possibly miraculous instance in which
something that can’t normally be seen or touched assumes a bodily form. For example, the Christian
religion was founded on the belief that Jesus was God incarnate.
