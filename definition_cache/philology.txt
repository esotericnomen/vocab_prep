Philology means the study of language. Not learning specific languages per se, but grammar and
history, and how sounds and meanings change over time.

If you study philology, you don't need anyone to tell you that the word philology comes from the
Greek philologia love of learning. It's one of the words ending in -logy, which means study. Think
biology (life), archaeology (ancient things), psychology (the mind), sociology (society).
