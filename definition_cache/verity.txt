If your friend tells you she saw a UFO yesterday afternoon, you might be inclined to question the
verity, or truthfulness, of her statement. Everyone knows UFOs are only visible at night.

Verity can also be used to mean “a true idea, belief, or statement.” Abstract concepts like love
and goodness are often referred to as verities, conveying the idea that they are universal truths.
Verity is related to the word verify, meaning “to determine whether something is true. If your
friend tells you that UFO story again, you should verify its verity!
