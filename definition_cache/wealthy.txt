If you have riches you are wealthy. Don't be misled into thinking riches means only money â€” to
many people, to have a healthy family and to be surrounded by love is to be abundantly wealthy.

The Old English word wela, via the Middle English welth, meaning happiness and prosperity in
abundance, is the source of our noun wealth. Although the Middle English wele meant well-being, the
word referred primarily to money and possessions. Many people still feel that way, but Henry David
Thoreau offered a different view: Wealth is the ability to fully experience life. That is, true
wealth is having whatever means the most to you.
