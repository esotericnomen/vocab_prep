Perspicacious is an adjective that means shrewd and wise. A perspicacious child can't be fooled when
her parents try to keep a secret by talking in Pig Latin.

The adjective perspicacious is a long word for a short definition: keen or shrewd. This word is
descended from the Latin word perspicere, which means to look closely. In other words, if you look
closely at something you are paying attention to it and know it well. A definition of perspicacious
that is out of date but still relevant is having keen eyesight and people who can see clearly are
also aware and attentive!
