turn the flour into a viscid paste, and then you'll really have a mess!

The word viscid is from the Latin word viscum, or birdlime. Birdlime is a sticky substance made from
sap and is smeared on branches. Small birds land on the branches and are trapped, allowing someone
to easily catch them. The word viscous comes from the same word and has a similar meaning
Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; think of lava and how it moves slowly and thickly down a mountain.
