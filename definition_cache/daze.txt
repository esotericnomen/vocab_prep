A daze is a type of confusion, when you have a lack of clarity. When you first wake up, you might be
in a  bit of a daze, shuffling about the house before your brain really starts working.

Daze can also mean the feeling of distress and disbelief that you have when something bad happens to
you accidentally: After getting hit in the head by a football, you were in such a daze you couldn't
remember where you were. As a verb, daze means to stun. You will definitely daze your father when
you tell him that you eloped.
