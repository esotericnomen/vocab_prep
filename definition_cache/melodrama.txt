A melodrama is a show or story with an overly dramatic characters and plot lines. Many people like
to escape their own troubles by watching what the characters go through on a weekly television
melodrama.

A melodrama has a thrilling plot, with many extreme twists, suspense, and plenty of romance. Soap
operas and popular films can often be described as melodramas, full of the tension and excitement
that draws a viewer in. Anything but mellow, melodrama comes from the Greek word melos, song, and
the French drame, drama -- because the original melodramas of the early 1800s were dramatic plays
that included songs and music.
