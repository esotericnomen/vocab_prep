Something that's powerful displays, well, power. Your neighbor who just finished training to be a
fireman probably looks much more powerful than he used to.

We use powerful for many different senses of strong. A powerful medicine is very effective. A
powerful politician has more influence than most politicians. A powerful dog could probably knock
you down. If you're reading a book written in folksy Southern vernacular, someone might use powerful
to mean very, as in, that was a powerful good supper, Miss Jackson, or you look powerful good
tonight.
