A manifestation is the public display of emotion or feeling, or something theoretical made real.

Manifestation's origins are in religion and spirituality because if something spiritual becomes
real, it is said to be a manifestation.  The word's usage has spread to include all aspects of life.
The submarine is a manifestation of da Vinci's sketches. The crowd's cheering hysteria was the
manifestation of years of allegiance to the now victorious soccer league.
