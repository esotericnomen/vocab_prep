A parvenu is an upstart, somebody who's suddenly rich but doesn't fit into his new social status. If
you're a parvenu, people might also describe you as nouveau-riche or an arriviste. Maybe it's not
quite so insulting in French.

The Beverly Hillbillies, a sitcom from the 1960s, featured the Clampetts, classic parvenus, who
struck oil on their backwoods West Virginia swampland. They arrive at their mansion in Beverly
Hills, dressed in overalls, in their pick-up truck, with their shabby furniture strapped on top. As
parvenus, they donâ&euro;&trade;t fit in â&euro;&rdquo; to say the least. Parvenu is from French,
and it's the past participle of parvenir, arrived.
