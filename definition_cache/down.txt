The adverb down means from a higher place to a lower one, like when a person climbs down a ladder or
a waiter puts a tray full of cakes down on a table.

Anything that moves lower â&euro;&rdquo; in height, location, or volume â&euro;&rdquo; is down, so
you can travel down south, tell your dog to get down, or turn your loud music down. Down can also
refer to a mood or condition; if you're feeling down, you're sad, and if your computer is down, it's
not working. Another meaning of down is the soft feathers of a young bird, which is sometimes used
to fill coats or comforters.
