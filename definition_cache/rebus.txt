A rebus is a puzzle that uses symbols or pictures to represent the sounds of words. A picture of an
eye, a heart, and a ewe might be used to say I love you. Isn't that sweet?

A rebus uses pictures and symbols to convey a message in what may be considered a fun code. The
letters ICU might be used to stand for the sentence â&euro;&oelig;I see you.â&euro;? The word
rebus could be depicted with the letters RE followed by a picture of a school bus. Some children's
books use rebuses as a way of introducing kids to the reading process, but rebuses can also be quite
challenging, even for the adult mind.
