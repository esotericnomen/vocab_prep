Add the Greek prefix meta- (beyond) to the base physical (nature), and you get metaphysical â€” a
near synonym to the Latin-based word supernatural. Both concern phenomena that are outside everyday
experience or knowledge.

The adjective metaphysical entered the English language through Aristotle, whose Metaphysics is a
collection of treatises that follows his work, Physics. Physics concerned natural philosophy, what
we call science today, while Metaphysics dealt with more abstract questions about the reality beyond
what we perceive with our senses. Look at a physical object, say an apple. At what exact point did
that apple come into existence? If you eat it, does it cease to exist, or does it still exist but in
a changed way? These are metaphysical questions.
