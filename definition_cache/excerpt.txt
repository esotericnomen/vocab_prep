Instead of sharing all 147 lines of your favorite poem in class, you might want to read an excerpt,
that is, just a part of the verses, so no one dozes off.

Excerpt sounds a lot like except with an added r, and it came into English in the 16th century from
a Latin word meaning plucked out. When the word is used as a verb, excerpt means to take a portion
out, usually from a play, book, article, song, or other written work. And the part that is taken out
also is called an excerpt, but it is a noun, that is, a thing. An excerpt is something you excerpt,
or pluck out, from a larger piece.
