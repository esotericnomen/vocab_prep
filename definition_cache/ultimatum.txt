An ultimatum is a final demand attached to a threat, like If you don't do it, I'll never speak to
you again. Ultimatums are serious business.

The noun ultimatum has Latin roots meaning final and that's still what the word means today. It is
the final demand, usually with an implicit or explicit or else attached to it. Often, the person on
the receiving end of the ultimatum rebels, however, and will say something like, Don't give me any
ultimatums!
