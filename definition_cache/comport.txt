Comport means to behave, and particularly to behave well. If you attend a school for social
etiquette, you will learn how to comport yourself properly at the dinner table.

You’ll usually find comport in one of two phrases: with yourself, himself, etc., as in, With all

you see the second version, comport means something more like agree. For example, you could say, I
don’t think your ripped jeans and beat up t-shirt really comport with the guidelines for Casual
Friday.
