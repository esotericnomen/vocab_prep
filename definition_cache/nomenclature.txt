When adjusting to a new job, you may have trouble understanding the nomenclature, or system of
naming things, in the workplace. Just remember: they’re “guests,” not “customers, and they
push a “purchase buggy,” not a “shopping cart.”

The nomen- in nomenclature comes from the Latin word for name. Nomenclature is a system for giving
names to things within a particular profession or field. For instance, you may have heard of
binomial nomenclature in biology class. It refers to the way of referring to living things by two
names, like calling humans Homo sapiens. Biologists all follow the same nomenclature so that they
are easily understood by each other.
