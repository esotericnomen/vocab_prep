Supposititious is a fancy word for based on guesswork. Used in a legal sense more than anything else
â€” if a piece of evidence is supposititious, then it's basically hypothetical. It doesn't have any
hard facts to back it up.

As the sound of the word suggests, supposititious is related to the more common supposition, meaning
something uncertain or unconfirmed. Supposititious also has a slightly different and less common
meaning of something that has been substituted illegally for something else. If you ask for
Champagne in a bar and you get a glass of sparkling white instead, that is truly one supposititious
beverage.
