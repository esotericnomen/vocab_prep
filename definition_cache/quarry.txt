Both meanings of quarry have to do with going after something. An animal being hunted is called
quarry, and when you dig a hole in the earth looking for rocks, both the digging and the hole are
called quarry as well.

Gross fact: Quarry derives from the Latin cor heart, because hunters used to drape the entrails of
their chosen quarry on their dogs' backs. The origin in a word for heart can help you remember both
quarries: a rock quarry is searching down toward the heart of the earth; a stag's heart is
considered a hunter's greatest prize.
