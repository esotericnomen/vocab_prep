If you don't care one iota about something, it means you donâ€™t care about it even one little bit.
An iota is something very small.

An iota is the smallest letter of the Greek alphabet. The expression not one iota comes from the
Bible (Matthew 5:18): For truly, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a
dot, will pass from the Law until all is accomplished.
