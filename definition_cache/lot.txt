A lot is a plot of land. When you buy a house, you also buy the lot on which it sits.

If there's an empty lot in your neighborhood, it means there's a space covered with grass or
pavement that's large enough for a house or building to fit there. Another kind of lot is a set or
group of items. At an auction or estate sale, you might find a lot of antique silver spoons for
sale, or a lot of comic books Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; in either case, the lot is a collection.
