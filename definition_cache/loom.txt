Loom has two distinct meanings. First, it's a tool for weaving. Second, it means to appear or stand
over someone in a threatening way. The future loomed grim. The shadow loomed above us.

A common way we hear loom is in loomed large, as in, The specter of getting fired loomed large in
Amanda's imagination. Deriving from Low German or Dutch, the word sounds smoky (or misty) and
spectral: the Antarctic ice-shelf loomed on the horizon as Shackleton's ship approached the
continent.
