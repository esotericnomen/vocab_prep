Gastronomy is all about food — the study of food, the history of food, making good food — how we
have come to eat what we eat.

Despite appearances, gastronomy has nothing to do with gas (although if you eat a great deal of rich
food from France, which is where we get the word, it may lead to the intestinal discomfort known as
gas). Gastronomy concerns itself with the culture of your belly, gastro, in ancient Greek. In
France, where they take their food very seriously, they have an entire academy devoted to the study
of gastronomy, or gastronomie — as they say.
