To pay compensation for a loss, damages, or similar expense is to indemnify. The insurance company
indemnified its customers for their claims after the severe storm â€” one customer lost three cars,
a row boat, and a golf cart.

The verb indemnify also means to secure against future loss. The farmers bought insurance to
indemnify themselves and their animals against catastrophic loss. The word indemnify comes from the
Latin word indemnis, which means to unhurt. The city wanted to shut down an old local landmark
because they were afraid it no longer met modern safety standards, but local citizens wanted it to
remain. In a compromise, the owners agreed to indemnify the city against possible loss and the
landmark was allowed to remain.
