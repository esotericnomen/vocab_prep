When something is at the very peak of perfection, reach for this noun from Greek: acme. A brilliant
violinist might reach the acme of her career, but eventually she might become unstrung.

This noun referring to the highest point of something might sound comical because it has shown up so
often in cartoons as the name of a company, such as the one that makes Wile E. Coyote's contraptions
in the old Warner Brothers cartoons. But the word is actually a serious-minded import from Greek.
Near synonyms for high points include zenith, summit, pinnacle, apex, and peak, but acme has a
special nuance for an ultimate point of perfection.
