Notoriety is fame you get from doing something bad or being part of a misfortune or scandal. Just
remember: Notoriety's not al-righty. Charles Manson earned notoriety for his grisly crimes.

In our celebrity culture, it's hard not to think that seizing your 15 minutes of fame is worth the
shame of earning it through stupidity, scandal, or evil. (See: people's motives for going on reality
television.) The rest of us can comfort ourselves with in our boringness that most people who become
notorious fade from the public mind quickly.
