A person of great or fine repute is someone who's widely known and highly respected.  The word has a
stuffy feel, so you're better off describing a cellist as being of great repute than, say, a rapper
or comedian.

Like the words reputation and putative, repute comes from the Latin word putare, which means
consider.  And the re? Let's say that the cellist Yo-Yo Ma is widely respected. That means a lot of
people consider him to be great.  He's considered great not just once but again (and again and
again).
