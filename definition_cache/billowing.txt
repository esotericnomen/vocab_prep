If you've ever seen a space shuttle launch, you probably remember seeing all the white smoke
billowing, or swelling and rolling forth, underneath.

You'll most often see the word billowing when someone is talking about smoke, steam, or the wind
blowing through something, like hair or a flag. The word bylgja, from which billow derives, comes
from an unusual source for English words: Old Norse.
