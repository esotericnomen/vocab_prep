Compulsive people have irresistible urges to do certain things, like a compulsive gossip who simply
cannot keep a secret.

If you're compulsive, you can't stop yourself from doing something, like compulsive counting of the
sidewalk blocks on your way to school. There is sometimes an upside to compulsive behavior
Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; like a compulsive desire to be the best hockey player, which makes you work hard to
make it happen. Someone who has compulsive tendencies can be called a compulsive, the noun form of
the word.
