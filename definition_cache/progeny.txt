A sing-song rhyme may help in remembering the word progeny: All of you, all of me, together we make
progeny. The you and me can be a man and a woman making a baby, or trees and plants making little
offshoots, or progeny of their own.

Synonyms for progeny include descendants, product, and offspring, and the word is applied to more
than just living creatures. An idea can give birth to, so to speak, progeny, or similar ideas from
the main seed idea; and a suite of products, such as a progeny of handheld applications, can come
from a main prototype. Children are progeny of their parents, just as tomatoes are the progeny of
plant pairings. Most anything that is the fruit of something planted or seeded is progeny.
