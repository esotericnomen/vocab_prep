Sociology is the study of human cultures, communities, and societies. Sociology attempts to explain
how a society works, whether that society is a native tribe in the Amazon or an old folks’ home in
Nebraska.

Sociology is one of the social — sometimes called soft — sciences. It's the study of human
actions and interactions. People who study sociology — sociologists — look at how people
interact in groups and what kinds of religions, governments, schools, and other ways of life they
create. While psychology looks mostly at individuals, sociology looks at people in groups.
