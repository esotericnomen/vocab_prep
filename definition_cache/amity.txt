The word amity refers to a peaceful, friendly nature, much like the French word for friend â€” ami.

From the Latin amicus friend, amity means friendly relations. That strong sense of friendship lends
irony to the name of the book, and later the movie, called The Amityville Horror, about a horrifying
town with a weirdly cheerful name. In truth, though, amity means mutual understanding and peace.
Wouldn't it be nice if all of the world's nations lived in amity?
