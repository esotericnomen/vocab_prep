If you tend to hold a grudge, you don't let it go when you feel someone's insulted or wronged you.
I hope you won't hold a grudge against me for bringing it up.

Grudge comes from the now dead Middle English word grutch, which meant to complain or grumble.
Someone who bears a grudge might often be grouchy.  You can specify a type of grudge: political
grudge, personal grudge, etc.  You know Grandpa's been holding a grudge against the neighbors for
years, but you have to wonder: How long can he hold that shotgun?
