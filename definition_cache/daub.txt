Whenever you smear something on a surface, you are daubing. Abstract Expressionists may have been
able to daub a canvas with paint and sell it for millions, but you probably wouldn’t be so lucky.

Daub can be used as a verb or as a noun, and is derived from the Old French debaur which comes from
the Latin dealbare “to whiten.” It is also used to describe the process of covering a surface
with an adhesive substance such as plaster, mud or grease. However, in its noun form, it means  a
smear of something. When you are ordering a bagel with a smear, you could impress the guy at the
deli by asking for a daub instead.
