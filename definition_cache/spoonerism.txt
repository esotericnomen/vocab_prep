Here's the official meaning of spoonerism: The transposition of initial consonants in a pair of
words. Zzzzzzzzz. Okay, pretty dull sounding, but in practice actually pretty funny: My lips are
zipped becomes my zips are lipped.

Popcorn becomes cop porn. Son, it is now kisstumary to cuss the bride. You get the idea. We owe the
invention of the Spoonerism, or at least its great fame, to a nineteenth-century English reverend
named Archibald Spooner, who was famous for mixing up his words. He wasn't a drunk, although
drunkenness can sometimes cause spoonerisms, just absent-minded. The first two examples above, by
the way, are modern Spoonerisms, too risquĂŠ for the good reverend himself. The last? A 100%
genuine original Spoonerism.
