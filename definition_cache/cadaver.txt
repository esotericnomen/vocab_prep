A cadaver is a dead human body used in scientific or medical research. If you are dead, you are a
corpse, but if Dr. Frankenstein robs your grave so he can use your body for research, you become a
cadaver. Umm... congratulations?

Cadaver comes from the Latin verb, cadere, which means “to fall. Its English origins refer to
soldiers who died in battle, i.e. the fallen. Dissection of a cadaver is a major rite of passage for
medical school students––some have been known to run from the room and throw up — though most
surprise themselves.
