A man who dotes on or really adores his wife is uxorious; often that's an admirable trait, but
sometimes, if it's carried too far, it makes you ask, Who wears the pants in this family?

Uxorious goes back to the Latin root ÌÅ∞xor, wife, and it came into English in the 16th century.
Uxorious is usually negative, a way to show that a husband has too much concern for his wife or is
submissive to her wants. The husband is uxorious if he lets his wife control him. There's no
corresponding adjective you can use of a wife dominated by her husband, at least none in common use.
