Conception means any idea or concept, or a sum of ideas and concepts.  Your conception for designing
the little girl's room with a princess theme was a hit.  Her evil stepsisters are jealous.

The noun conception can also mean a beginning Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; of anything in general, or of a
pregnancy, specifically. August 15 marked the anniversary of the conception of your design business.
Your parents told me their youngest child has been a holy terror since conception.  So, do you get
along with your older siblings?
