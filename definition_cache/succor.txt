Succor is relief or help. If you've just woken up in the midst of a lion's den, wearing nothing but
raw meat pajamas — sounds like you could use some succor!

In archaic times, succor meant a reinforcement of troops during a hard battle. These days though,
those reinforcements are a bit more figurative. Succor is a helping hand in a time of need, relief
when the going gets tough. Succor can also be used as a verb, as in, After Bob fell overboard, he
was saved — succored by a life preserver.
