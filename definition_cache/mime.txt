A mime is a performer who uses exaggerated facial expressions and body movements — instead of
words — to communicate with his audience.

You may have seen a mime pretending she's trapped in an invisible box, using gestures to make it
appear that she is pushing against walls and a ceiling. Many mimes also wear clown-like makeup, wear
simple clothing, and refuse to speak. You can use the word mime as a verb as well, to describe what
you do when you imitate your least favorite teacher for the amusement of your friends. The Greek
root word is mimos, imitator, actor, or buffoon.
