A legal word, extradition means sending someone back to the country or state where they've been
accused of a crime. Getting countries to agree on the terms of extradition can take years.

It can be hard enough for lawyers in the U.S. to agree on a person's extradition from one state to
another, so you can imagine how difficult it can be for officials from different countries.
Extradition can have real consequences for the person being extradited. Suppose the laws there allow
for the death penalty: a person accused of a capital crime would be smart to fight extradition to
that place. The Latin prefix ex- means from, out of, and trÄ ditiĹ?n- means handing over, so
extradition is the handing-over of someone from one jurisdiction to another.
