Kinesiology is the study of human movement. Students who study sports medicine in college will often
take classes in kinesiology.

Studying the way the human body moves, how it's affected by movement, and the ways it's prone to
being hurt by movement all fall under the label of kinesiology. Physical education teachers,
coaches, physical therapists, dancers Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; all of these people have an interest in
kinesiology, because their jobs are directly connected to the movement of the human body. The word
kinesiology comes from a Greek root word, kinesis, motion or movement.
