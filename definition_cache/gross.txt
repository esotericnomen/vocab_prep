Get ready, because gross has a few different meanings. When something is gross, it's disgusting. The
noun, a gross, is the complete amount (before expenses), and the verb to gross is to bring in money.

Two things will tell you which meaning is the right one with a word like gross, the part of speech
and the context. If you're talking about awful, sickening, vile things such as dissecting an animal
or filthy behavior, you're looking at the adjective gross. Ew! That guy is gross. If you're talking
about, say, how much money a movie made, that's the noun gross. That was the biggest gross in
history! Likewise, the verb to gross is to pull in money. The bake sale grossed 29 bucks! But
remember, the gross is how much you made in total, not how much you cleared Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; the net
or profit.
