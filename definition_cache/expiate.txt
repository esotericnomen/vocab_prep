In the fairy tale, the baker must expiate his fatherâ€™s sins by bringing the witch three
ingredients for a magic potion: a cow, a cape and a slipper. Expiate means to make amends or atone
for a wrong you or someone else has committed.

After the incident on the hill, a mortified Jill expiated her guilt by buying Jack a brand new
crown.  The shiny new crown served as compensation, or expiation, for the broken one. That it cost
her so dearly made the expiatory gesture especially meaningful to poor Jack.
