When a magician waves his hands over a hat and pulls out a rabbit, he is performing an act of
legerdemain or trickery.

Legerdemain can be used literally to describe a magic trick, or figuratively to describe some other
kind of trickery or deceit. If you and some friends cook up a scheme that involves telling
complicated lies so that you can stay out all night, you are guilty of legerdemain. The word comes
from the French lĂŠger de main which means dexterous, or light of hand.
