Slovenly is what your great aunt Mehitabel might call you if you came to high tea without a necktie.
It means messy or unkempt, but is a word you probably won't hear messy or unkempt people using.

Slovenly has meant messy or unkempt since the 1500s, but it had a brief heyday before that of
meaning low or base. This class association remains embedded in the word Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; someone who
uses the word slovenly today is most likely also going to raise his or her pinky while drinking from
a cup of tea.
