Do you speak Spanish or French, in addition to English? Then you are multilingual, which is an
impressive and practical thing to be.

Multilingual people can speak and/or write more than one language, whether that's English and
Japanese, Spanish and sign language, or French and Klingon. Except for the silly example of Klingon,
being multilingual is extremely useful Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; it can help you get jobs and succeed in life,
because you're able to communicate with more people. Becoming multilingual is a great goal for
anyone. It helps you learn about the world and do more than a monolingual person can.
