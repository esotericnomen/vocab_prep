A purveyor is someone who supplies goods â€” often of food or drinks. If you're a seafood purveyor
you will always smells a bit fishy, which is no surprise, considering that you sell cod and haddock
all day long.

A purveyor can be someone who provides food or drinks, as in the popcorn purveyor who walks up and
down through the stands of a baseball game trying to peddle his salty treats. When you go to the
circus you will see clowns, who are purveyors of silliness because of their repertoire of fun and
hilarious stunts.
