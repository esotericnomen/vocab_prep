When you infer something, you read between the lines. To infer  is to make a well informed guess —
if you see your mom’s bag on the table, you might infer that she’s home.

When you infer, you listen closely to someone and guess at things they mean but haven't actually
said. It’s like guessing, but not making wild guesses. You're making deductions — guesses based
on logic. Another kind of inferring is more scientific, like when a scientist has part of a dinosaur
fossil and can infer what the rest of the dinosaur looked like. When you see the word infer, think
educated guess.
