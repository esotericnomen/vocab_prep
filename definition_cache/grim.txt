Things that are gloomy, stark, ghastly, and somber are grim. Sunshine, puppies, and rainbows are not
grim; zombies, reapers, and mummies are grim. Less scary things like drizzly, foggy days can also be
called grim.

Two famous uses of the adjective grim are the Grim Reaper and Grimm's Fairy Tales. Mr. Reaper shows
up in movies and books wearing a long, hooded black cape and carrying a scythe, or long-handled
blade used, in less grim circumstances, for mowing grass and reaping grain: he represents death. The
real-life German brothers wrote some bone-chilling tales under their own name, Grimm, meaning cruel,
fierce, which is related to the English word grim.  Modern grim things include crime-drama images of
dead bodies and characters in horror movies.
