To topple something is to knock it down. A house of cards can be toppled â€” so can a government.

Things can topple in several ways. If a building collapses or falls down for any reason, it topples.
If you knocked over another student, you toppled that person. Governments that are overthrown are
also said to be toppled. When you see the word topple, someone or something is going down.
