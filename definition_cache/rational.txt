Use the adjective rational to describe people or ideas that operate according to logic or reason.
While your brother has an artistic temperament, you have a rational one.

Rational comes from the Latin word rationalis, meaning reasonable or logical.  If you're rational,
you do things based on logic, as opposed to impulse or whimsy. The original meaning in English was
of something endowed with the ability to reason. Before we knew how smart some animals like dolphins
are, writers liked to distinguish rational human minds from the supposedly irrational, instinctual
minds of animals.
