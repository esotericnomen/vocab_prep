If you fainted or threw up at the sight of frog intestines in biology class, you’re squeamish —
easily nauseated or shocked by unpleasant, icky things. No horror movies for you!

We get squeamish from the Anglo-French word escoimous, meaning disdainful or shy. It can mean shy of
blood or gore, or less often, it is used to describe a prissy kind of fear of confrontation with
others. How can you become a heart surgeon if you’re squeamish enough to faint every time you get
a paper cut? If you’re squeamish about confronting the noisy neighbors, why not slip a note under
their door asking them to pipe down?
