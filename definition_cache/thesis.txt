A thesis is the most important or foundational idea of an argument. If you write a paper with the
central thesis that girls are yucky, you'll need to back that up with cooties-based research.

The noun thesis has more than one important sense to it. One definition of thesis is that it is the
most important or foundational idea of an argument, presentation, or piece of writing. But it can
also mean a large work of art, criticism, or scientific research that represents original research
and is generally the final requirement for an academic degree.
