A whiff can mean the hint of something you smell. When you drive past the sewage treatment plant and
suddenly roll up your car windows, it's usually because you've gotten a whiff of the plant's special
odor.

Whiff can be used as either a noun or verb, and it implies a brief or small puff or sniff. A person
can have a whiff of the exotic, which means they are living like the rest of us, but there is a
little something about them that seems foreign or different. Sometimes, of course, odors are so
overpowering that a small sniff is all you need: Take a whiff of this, your friend might say to you,
holding out a carton of sour milk. In that case, one whiff will be more than enough.
