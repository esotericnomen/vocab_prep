Peremptory comments are like orders. If you say something in a peremptory manner, you want people to
stop what they’re doing and do what you say. Peremptory comments put an end to a discussion, and
that’s final!

The word peremptory comes from the Latin peremptorius for “decisive, final.” Trace it further
and find that peremptor  means destroyer, from perimpere for destroy, cut off.” Basically,
peremptory commands destroy the conversation. They are given with an air of authority, and they are
often barked. In the courtroom, peremptory orders are not open to appeal; they’re final. Outside
of the courtroom, a peremptory manner is just plain rude.
