A preamble is a brief introduction to a speech, like the Preamble to the Constitution that starts
out We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union...do ordain and
establish this Constitution.

Preamble comes from the Latin praeambulus which means walking before. And that's what a preamble
does Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; it walks before a speech, often explaining what's coming. It's like the White
Rabbit introducing the Queen of Hearts in Alice in Wonderland.  Since it goes before a speech, think
of it as a pre-ramble.  A preamble is usually used for formal documents; you wouldn't include one in
a text to your best friend.
