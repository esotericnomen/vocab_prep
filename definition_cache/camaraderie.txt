Camaraderie is a spirit of good friendship and loyalty among members of a group. You might not like
your job, but still enjoy the camaraderie of the people you work with.

A high level of camaraderie among the athletes on and off the field not only makes it fun to play
sports, but is likely to make your team win. This noun was borrowed from French, from camarade
comrade. It retains the French spelling and Frenchlike pronunciation kahm-uh-RAHD-uh-ree. The suffix
-erie corresponds to English -ery, used with nouns to indicate a quality.
