The trunk of some people's cars may contain items as disparate as old clothes, rotting food, and
possibly a missing relative. Disparate things are very different from each other.

Near synonyms are unequal and dissimilar. The adjective disparate is from Latin disparātus, from
disparāre to separate, divide, from the prefix dis- apart plus parāre to prepare. Disparate in the
sense of very different probably developed by association with the Latin adjective dispar unequal,
different.
