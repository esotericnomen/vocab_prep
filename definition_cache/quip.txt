A quip — a short, witty comment — can be pleasant, wise, or sarcastic, but usually carries an
element of humor.

A quip, often taken as a sign of cleverness, is a witty remark that sounds spur-of-the-moment. A
successful quip must sound offhand, as though it were an afterthought, even if the speaker has been
honing the statement for days.  Dorothy Parker was a famous writer known for her quick quips, such
as, The best way to keep children home is to make the home atmosphere pleasant — and let the air
out of the tires.
