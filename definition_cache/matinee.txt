An afternoon performance is called a matinee, like a matinee performance of a play that starts at
two o’clock.

The noun matinee is related to French word matin, which means “morning.” From the 1930’s
through the 1960’s, afternoon movies were the precursors to soap operas and the term “matinee
idol” referred to the male heartthrobs who acted in them. Such men had many fans but they didn't
have the critical respect of prime time actors. In many places, heading to a movie matinee is a way
to save a few bucks; it's cheaper than evening ticket prices.
