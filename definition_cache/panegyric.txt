A formal, high-minded speech can be described with a formal, high-minded word — the word
panegyric, which is a very elaborate tribute to someone. You could consider most eulogies as
panegyrics.

It stands to reason that the original use of the word panegyris, from which panegyric derives, was
to describe a public gathering in honor of a Greek god. The Latin, L. panegyricus, altered slightly
to mean public eulogy, which around the 16th Century shifted to the French panégyrique, which meant
laudation. In any case, the word today stands for high praise given in a speech or tribute as
highfalutin as the word itself sounds.
