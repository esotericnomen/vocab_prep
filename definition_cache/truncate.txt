The verb truncate means to cut off or shorten. You can truncate a board that is too long using a
power saw, a chain saw, or perhaps even a karate kick.

The word truncate is from a Latin word, truncare, which means to maim or to cut off. Although this
brings to mind a more grisly image (truncate a limb in an accident), you can actually truncate
things that are not related to anatomy. You could truncate an essay by omitting a paragraph or two,
or you could even truncate your vacation in Belize by heading home early.
