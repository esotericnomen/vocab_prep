Patience is a person's ability to wait something out or endure something tedious, without getting
riled up. It takes a lot of patience to wait for your braces to come off, deal with a 2 year old
temper tantrum, or build a house out of toothpicks piece by piece.

Having patience means you can remain calm, even when you've been waiting forever or dealing with
something painstakingly slow or trying to teach someone how to do something and they just don't get
it. It involves acceptance and tolerance, and is usually easier to have when there's something in it
for you at the end. That could be a goal you've been slowly working to achieve, or just lower blood
pressure.
