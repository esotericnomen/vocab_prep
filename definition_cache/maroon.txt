To maroon is to strand someone in an isolated place, often a deserted island. Think of Gilligan's
Island, Survivor, or Lost — TV shows that feature folks marooned on islands — and you've got the
idea.

Maroon can be a noun or verb, depending on how you use it. If you maroon your best friend on a
deserted island, in addition to being a terrible friend, you're using the word as a verb. If this
friend was wearing a brownish-red shirt at the time he was marooned, you would use the adjective
maroon to describe the shirt's color.
