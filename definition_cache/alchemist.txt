If you're an alchemist, then you try to change common metals into gold. People have been trying to
figure that out for a long time, so you might need to have another job to finance your career as an
alchemist.

The word alchemist comes from alchemy, which has origins in the Greek word khemeia, meaning art of
transmuting metals. Active since ancient times, alchemists could be considered very early chemists
because of their work trying to transform base metals into gold. Alchemists could also be considered
wizards because they attempted to make special elixirs that would give everlasting life and cure
sickness.
