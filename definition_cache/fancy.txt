Fancy can be an adjective, noun, or a verb. As an adjective, it’s the opposite of plain. The noun
names something that isn’t real. When someone likes or wants something, the verb can be used: “I
fancy a cup of tea.” Doesn’t that sound fancy?

Fancy is an old contraction of the word fantasy. You’ll often see this word used in the phrase
“flights of fancy.” This phrase refers to an unrealistic goal or idea such as, “He has flights
of fancy about running off to Hollywood and becoming a movie star.” Fancy can also be used as an
expression of affection. If you have a crush on someone, for instance, you could say that you
“took a fancy” to him or her.
