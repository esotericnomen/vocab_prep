If you’re satisfied, you’re contented, and you don’t need anything more. You're not overjoyed,
but you're not complaining either.

When something is satisfied, the requirements have been met and nothing more needs to be done. When
you pay back the money you owe on a loan, you have satisfied the debt. If you just had a delicious
meal, your hunger is probably satisfied. If you’re an outlaw cowboy and your partner double
crosses you, you won’t be satisfied until you’ve run him out of town. Your desire for revenge
must be satisfied!
