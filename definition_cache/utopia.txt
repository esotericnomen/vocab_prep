Utopia is a perfect paradise that doesn’t exist, but which we all dream of anyway. In the dead of
winter, we might imagine a utopia full of palm trees, warm breezes, and sun-soaked beaches.

Utopia didn't evolve from Latin or another old foreign language. Author Thomas More actually created
the noun in one of his books to describe an imaginary island where all systems—political, social,
and legal—are perfect and operate harmoniously. The definition of utopia was later broadened to
imply any perfect place. The opposite of utopia is dystopia, coined in 1868 by J.S. Mill to describe
an “imaginary bad place.”
