Cartoon characters often end up on a precipice, the edge of a steep cliff, where their chubby toes
curl and cling as they totter and eventually fall, making a hole in the ground below and getting up
again. Most real people avoid precipices.

Unless you're a skilled climber or mountain-sport enthusiast, a precipice is a scary thing. Some
imagine falling off and making the sharp drop, while others get dizzy just thinking about looking
down. This makes sense, considering that the 17th-century English word precipice comes, through
French, from Latin words meaning headlong and even abrupt descent. In modern use, precipice also
describes how it feels to fall, or fail, in areas of life that don't involve mountains, such as
being on the precipice of losing everything.
