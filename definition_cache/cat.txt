What's another name for the four-legged feline that lies around on your keyboard all day and purrs?
You might call it “Fluffy,” but it’s also known as a cat.

If you’re in the market for a pet cat, just make sure it meows, and doesn’t roar like the lion,
tiger, or jaguar, all of which are in the same family as the housecat. Domesticated as long ago as
ancient Egyptian times, the cat is a fixture not only in many homes, but also in a host of English
expressions — like, “when the cat’s away, the mice will play,” “it’s raining cats and
dogs,” and “the cat’s pajamas.”
