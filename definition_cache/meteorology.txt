When the weather man tells you it's going to rain today, he is giving a meteorology report, or
weather forecast. Meteorology is the study of our atmosphere.

Meteorology comes from the Greek meteÄ¹?rologia meaning of the atmosphere. While meteorology
involves various branches including aviation and agricultural studies, most commonly we see it in
our everyday lives through weather forecasting, a process that involves collecting data about an
atmosphere to determine what the weather will be. If you're fascinated by storms and hurricanes,
consider a career in meteorology.
