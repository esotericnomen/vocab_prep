A document is a piece of paper that contains official information. Don't you wish you had a document
saying that the bank owed you $5 million?

Document comes from the Latin verb meaning to teach, so a document instructs you with the
information it contains. Legal documents such as contracts contain instructions on how the people
signing it will act. Passports, driver√¢&euro;&trade;s licenses and birth certificates are all
official documents. As a verb, document means to record in detail, or offer supporting evidence for.
If you call a company to complain about something, make sure to document your phone calls by noting
the date you called, who you spoke to and what was said.
