A parsimonious person is unwilling to spend a lot of money. You know those people who count up every
penny when it's time to split a restaurant bill? You can call them parsimonious. Or cheap.

Stingy is the most common and general synonym, but there are many other near synonyms: thrifty,
frugal, penurious, niggardly, penny-pinching, miserly, tight-fisted, tight. The adjective
parsimonious was formed in English from the noun parsimony the quality of being careful in spending
(from Latin parcimonia, from parcere to spare) plus the suffix Ã¢&euro;&ldquo;ous having the quality
of.
