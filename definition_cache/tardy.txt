When you're tardy, you're late. If you've ever been late for school, you know about tardy, and you
may have a stash of notes your teacher has sent home to your parents, informing them of your
tardiness.

You may be tardy for an appointment because you got stuck in traffic, or maybe you just slept late
and you don't have good time management skills. Whatever the excuse, being tardy almost always
annoys whoever's waiting for you. As a reality TV star once crooned, Don't be tardy for the party.
The word comes from the Latin tardus, meaning slow.
