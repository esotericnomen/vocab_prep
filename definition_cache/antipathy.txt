An antipathy is a deep-seated dislike of something or someone. Usually it's a condition that is
long-term, innate, and pretty unlikely to change — like your antipathy for the Red Sox.

If you look at the Greek roots of this word — anti- (meaning against) and pathos (meaning
feeling), you can see that antipathy is a feeling against someone or something. In general,
antipathies are considered feelings that are kept at least somewhat under wraps and are not out on
the surface.
