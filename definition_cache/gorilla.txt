A gorilla is the world's largest primate — the kind of great, powerful ape you might see on an
African safari.

The stocky, large-headed gorilla is one of the most impressive animals you'll come across in the
primate area of a zoo. Gorillas are vegetarians whose native habitat is the forest of central west
Africa. The word gorilla is sometimes also used to refer to a big, aggressive man. It was first
coined in the 19th century by a United States missionary to Africa, from the Greek word gorillai —
the word Carthaginian explorer Hanno used to mean wild, hairy people in 500 B.C.E.
