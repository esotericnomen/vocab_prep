To trickle is to weakly flow out of something, like a faucet. A trickle is like a drip.

There are a lot of ways water can flow, but one type of slow dripping is called trickling. If your
shower is only releasing a trickle of water, you're not going to get much of a shower. If it's
raining â&euro;&rdquo; but only a trickle â&euro;&rdquo; you might not need an umbrella. A
slightly leaky roof is trickling. A trickle is the opposite of a downpour or flood. Trickling can
also be called dribbling.
