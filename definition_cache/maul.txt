Maul is both the name of a heavy hammer, and also a verb meaning beating and scratching. Tigers,
lions, bears––animals with powerful paws and sharp claws, will maul their victims.

The maul came to be used as a weapon in the late Middle Ages––if your opponent is wearing armor
that a steel sword-blade can't penetrate, you can still inflict damage by mauling them with a
hammer. You might not be able to stab your opponent, but at least you can maul them.
