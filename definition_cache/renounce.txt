To renounce is to officially give up or turn away from. People on a diet usually renounce pizza and
chocolate cake, for example.

The transitive verb renounce is a stronger, more formal way of saying that you reject or disown
something. A prince who's tired of the royal life could renounce his title and become a commoner, or
a senator who wanted to become an independent would have to renounce his political party ties. You'd
be wise to heed the wisdom of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who said: â&euro;&oelig;To renounce liberty is
to renounce being a man, to surrender the rights of humanity and even its duties.â&euro;?
