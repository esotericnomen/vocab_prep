A zoologist is a scientist who studies animals. Zoologists are experts on everything about animals,
from their cells to the history of their evolution.

If you love and are fascinated by animals, you might decide to become a zoologist. Your major in
college will probably be zoology, which is a branch of biology focusing on all animals
Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; even those that are extinct. A zoologist may end up doing research, or work as a
zookeeper in a zoo. Zoologist shares a root with zoology, the Latin zoologia, which combines the
Greek words zoion, animal, and logia, study.
