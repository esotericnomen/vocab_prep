Punitive describes inflicting a punishment. If someone takes punitive action against you, you'll
probably whine and complain — you're in trouble and you're about to get punished.

An easy way to remember the meaning of punitive is that it looks like the word punish — both come
from the Latin root word punire, to inflict a penalty on. Punitive doesn't always refer to a person-
to-person punishment, like a mom disciplining a child. It can also describe the unpleasant result of
an action on a large scale, like the punitive effect higher taxes will have on the middle class.
