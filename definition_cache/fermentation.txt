Fermentation is the process in which a substance breaks down into a simpler substance.
Microorganisms like yeast and bacteria usually play a role in the fermentation process, creating
beer, wine, bread, kimchi, yogurt and other foods.

Fermentation comes from the Latin word fermentare, meaning “to leaven.” To make bread rise, you
use a leavening agent to “wake up” dry yeast by mixing it with water. The yeast then starts
“eating” the sugar in the dough and off-gassing alcohol: that’s fermentation. Grape juice
becomes wine as the fermentation process is complete.
