Use the adjective jejune to describe something that is uninteresting or insignificant. Many people
claim to find celebrity gossip jejune, but ask them about a recent movie star scandal and chances
are they know all about it.

Jejune can also describe something that’s immature or simplistic. All that actress could say about
her latest movie was that it was “Super fun”? That’s a pretty jejune comment. Basically jejune
means lacking substance. It originally comes from the Latin word jejunus, which means “fasting,”
so when something is jejune, it’s figuratively empty — devoid of intellectual nourishment.
