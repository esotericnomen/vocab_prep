You can never be too rich or too thin, but you certainly can be too gaunt. It means you look skinny
like you're sick, not skinny like you have a personal nutritionist slapping your hand when you reach
for a bonbon.

A good way to remember gaunt is that it rhymes with haunt, and gaunt people look pale, drawn, and
wasted â&euro;&rdquo; like you'd expect a haunting ghost to appear. Another way to remember it is
that g- + aunt is like great-aunt, and often when you appear to be gaunt you look like you're old
â&euro;&rdquo; like your Great Aunt Mildred.
