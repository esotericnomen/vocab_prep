Faithful describes someone who is reliable and consistent. If you're a faithful volunteer at the
animal shelter, you show up every Saturday and work hard to help the animals.

A faithful friend is loyal and steadfast Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; it's no wonder that many people consider
their dogs to be their most faithful companions. Though faithful usually describes a person, you can
also use it to talk about a particularly reliable object, like your faithful hiking boots. There's
another sense of faithful that means remaining true to, like faithful believers who pray and attend
religious services regularly.
