Use the verb converge to describe something that comes together at a common point: “Thousands of
Elvis fans plan to converge on the small Arkansas town where unconfirmed sightings of the deceased
superstar eating at a local barbeque restaurant had been widely reported.”

Two roads, a roomful of politicians, or a group of rabid fans — when things come together from
different points they converge. Converge traces back to the Latin word vergere, meaning “to bend
or to turn. The prefix con- means with, a good way to remember that things that converge come
together. Don't confuse it with diverge, which means the opposite: move away, because the prefix
“dis-” means “apart.”
