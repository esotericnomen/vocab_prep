Use the verb rhapsodize to describe something spoken about with extreme enthusiasm â€” and often at
great length, like that friend who tends to rhapsodize about her favorite movie for twenty minutes
straight.

To correctly pronounce rhapsodize, say RAP-so-dies. A rhapsody is a conversation or speech that is
elaborate and very emotional, so to rhapsodize is to speak that way. Someone with a tendency to
rhapsodize gets carried away with the emotion of the topic. That's why when you rhapsodize you don't
always notice that listeners stop listening if they don't share the same passion.
