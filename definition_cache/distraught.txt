If you are upset, you are distraught. If you want to explain why you are pulling your hair out, just
utter Leave me alone; I'm distraught It'll work.

While distraught may sound like an old Germanic past participle, it is actually an alteration of
distract from the Latin distrahere to draw in different directions. If you are distraught, you are
so upset that it's hard to think straight, hence your mind is drawn in different directions.
