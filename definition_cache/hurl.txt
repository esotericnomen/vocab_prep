When you hurl something, you throw it hard. You might hurl your shoe at a horrible bug if it
suddenly scuttled across the floor.

If you hurl a rock at a glass window, it will probably break, and if you hurl your trash in the
direction of a garbage can, it may or may not land inside. The verb hurl implies some force behind
your throw. The earliest English version was hurlen, which in the thirteenth century meant run
against each other or collide. It probably comes from the Germanic root hurr, which is also the root
of hurry, and means rapid motion.
