A mural is a large-scale painting usually done on a wall. Diego Rivera, the Mexican muralist, is
famous for the plaster murals he painted on the walls at Rockefeller Center in the 1930s.

Famous murals include the wall designs in the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican in Rome, and the Coit
Tower murals in San Francisco. Many murals were created during the Renaissance, and again during the
New Deal. They are also common features of urban settings â&euro;&ldquo;â&euro;&ldquo; painted on
the outsides of buildings and on playground walls.
