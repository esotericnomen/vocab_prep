The adjective retroactive refers to something happening now that affects the past. For example, a
retroactive tax is one that is passed at one time, but payable back to a time before the tax was
passed.

The Latin word retroagere, an ancestor of the adjective retroactive, means drive or turn back, and
goes  along with the meaning of the word. Sometimes governments pass rulings that are set as if they
were in effect before the ruling was even made, and that means they are retroactive. On the bright
side, you might be awarded a salary raise that is retroactive, meaning you'll get paid more for work
you did in the past. And, retroactive fads in clothing keep vintage clothing stores in business.
