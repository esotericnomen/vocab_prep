A jest is a joke. Are you a playful prankster? A jocular jokester? A witty wisecracker? Then you are
definitely well versed in the art of the jest.

To jest means to tease and joke in a playful way Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; like that court jester! Back in
medieval times, the court jester was hired to tell funny gestes, or tales. But nowadays he's always
cracking jokes and teasing the ladies about their wacky hairdos. All in jest of course. Otherwise
the king would have his head.
