A paleontologist is a scientist who studies fossils. If your basement is filled with fossils found
while out on hikes, then you're an amateur paleontologist.

Paleontology breaks down to the Greek for ancient (paleo), being (onto-), and study (-logy). A
paleontologist tries to figure out how things were in ancient times by studying their remains in
fossil traces. If you are obsessed with all things related to dinosaurs, becoming a paleontologist
might make sense for you.
