Reserved for the harmlessly stupid and truly meaningless, vacuous is a smart-sounding way to
describe something dumb. Celebrity gossip and reality TV is usually pretty vacuous, even if it's
fun.

If someone smiles at you in a way that seems fake or empty, you could describe the smile as vacuous.
An example of a vacuous comment would be a politician promising to make things better without
explaining how.  If something is vacuous, it's like a vacuum Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; hollow, empty, devoid
of substance.
