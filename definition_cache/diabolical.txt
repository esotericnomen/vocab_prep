Diabolical means evil. This is a strong word. Too much math homework might seem unfair, but it
probably isn't diabolical.

Diabolical is related to the Spanish word diablo, which means devil. In many religions and
mythologies, you can't get any more evil than a devil, so diabolical is a powerful term, stronger
than even despicable, which is another strong word for things that are hateful. Diabolical things
are also intentional. If you got hit by lightning, that's awful and harmful, but it's not
diabolical. If someone deliberately runs you over with a car, that's much more diabolical.
