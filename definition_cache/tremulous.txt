Something tremulous is shaky and quivering, usually from fear or lack of strength. If you're nervous
at your first big job interview, your hands might be a little tremulous.

Youâ&euro;&trade;ve likely heard the unsteady voice of a person close to tears, or seen the
trembling legs of a frightened child â&euro;&rdquo; both could certainly be described as tremulous.
But you can also use this adjective to describe a statement or action that lacks resolution and
courage, or even simply something that's shivering from the cold.
