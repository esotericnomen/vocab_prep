If you’re the type of person who likes to be in charge, you may have dreams of becoming a mogul
— that is, a powerful businessperson.

Mogul is a variant of the word Mongol, which we often use to refer to the empire once led by the
famous (or infamous) Genghis Khan. The Mogul Dynasty conquered India in the 16th century, and
remained in power for hundreds of year. As a result, the word mogul became synonymous with leader or
ruler.
