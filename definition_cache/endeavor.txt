When you endeavor to do something, you try hard to make it happen. A determined student might
endeavor to get straight As on her report card.

The ordinary objects of human endeavor â&euro;&rdquo; property, outward success, luxury
â&euro;&rdquo; have always seemed to me contemptible, wrote Albert Einstein. Presumably, NASA had
loftier objects in mind when they named one of their space shuttles Endeavour, using the British
spelling. The word comes from the Old French phrase mettre en deveir, or put in duty. As a verb,
it's a more impressive word than try and suggests you're doing your darnedest to make something
happen.
