Filth is disgusting dirt, grime, or other unsavory material. Filth is dog poop all over the
sidewalk, gunk under a movie seat, or even overly sexy stuff on TV.

You can use the noun filth when you're talking about some grimy substance, like the smelly filth on
the bottom of your shoes after you've walked across a cow pasture. You can also call a general state
of uncleanliness filth. You might say that the filth in your brother's room makes it impossible to
open the door. The Old English root word is fylรฐ, which means rotting matter. Ew.
