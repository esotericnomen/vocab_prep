If you give your best friend a bracelet for her birthday, then you’re a good friend. If you give
her a diamond bracelet, a racehorse, and an oil well, then you’re a munificent friend, meaning you
are very lavish when it comes to giving gifts. (And it’s possible you may also be broke.)

If you’re the generous type, you may already know that the word munificent traces back to the
Latin word unificus, meaning “generous, bountiful, liberal,” which in turn originated from the
word munus, meaning “gift or service.” Put those two concepts together and you have big-time
gift giving on a lavish scale. Use the word munificent to describe instances of over-the-top
generosity — think Oprah on a gift-giving binge at Christmastime.
