Defoliate means to take the leaves or branches off of a tree or bush. When your mom asks you to
defoliate the rose bushes, she wants you to trim them back.

In defoliate you see part of the word foliage, which means “leaves.” When your family takes a
trip to Vermont to look at the foliage, you’re going leaf peeping. If the trees of Vermont are
defoliated, there'll be nothing to look at on your leaf peeping trip except the poor quality black
and white television in your motel room. The adjective defoliated describes a tree or bush that has
had its leaves stripped.
