Cavalier means snobby. Someone who is cavalier has a bad attitude and regards other people as
inferior.

The word cavalier dates from mid-16th-century French, from the Latin caballus, meaning “horse.”
If you have a cavalier attitude, you look down on other people — as if you are sitting on a very
tall horse and other people are sitting down there on the ground.
