A catalyst is an event or person causing a change. Getting kicked out of your parents' house might
be a catalyst for becoming more independent.

The noun catalyst is something or someone that causes a change and is derived from a Greek word. It
can be somewhat ordinary, like a hot day being a catalyst for getting your hair cut really short. Or
it can be major, like how the assassination of the archduke Franz Ferdinand of the Austro-Hungarian
Empire is said to be a catalyst of World War I.
