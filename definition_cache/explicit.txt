Anything explicit is very clear, whether it's instructions or a dirty movie.

Thanks to parental-advisory warnings about explicit language or explicit violence, you might think
this word only applies to things that are dirty, naughty, or adult in some way. That is a common
meaning of explicit, but it's not the only meaning. This also means anything that is clear and easy
to understand. Explicit orders are easy to carry out; explicit instructions are easy to follow. When
someone is explicit, they're not beating around the bush or being confusing.
