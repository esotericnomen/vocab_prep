A tightwad is someone who avoids spending money, like a relative who wraps a piece of junk from the
basement in used wrapping paper and gives it to you, even though he or she could afford to buy you a
nice birthday present.

The “tight” part of this word refers to “close-fisted.” It’ll help you remember the
meaning of tightwad if you picture a person with his fist tightly closed around a wad of money, not
giving it up for anyone or anything. A tightwad takes being merely frugal or careful with money to a
whole new level. It's not that tightwads are poor; they simply hate to part with their money, even
if it's just a single dollar.
