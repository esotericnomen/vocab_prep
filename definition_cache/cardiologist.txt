A cardiologist is a heart doctor. He or she is the one to visit if you feel a tightness in your
chest and shortness of breath.

We know that the suffix -ologist refers to someone who studies some area. To that, we add cardio-,
which comes from the Greek kardia, meaning heart, and we get someone who studies the heart. The
actual study of the heart is called cardiology, with cardiologist coming along a few years later.
Besides treating the heart, a cardiologist is also concerned with the circulatory system, including
arteries and veins.
