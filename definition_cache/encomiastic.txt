If you were about to give a speech and the person introducing you gave an encomiastic introduction,
it would probably make you blush, since encomiastic means full of praise.

Encomiastic sounds like a fancy, dressed-up word, and it is: it’s usually used in formal
situations where someone is describing a person's most wonderful traits, either in a speech or in
writing. The Greek root is encomium, which means a particular kind of storytelling or public
speaking that heaps praise on a person or thing. If you rearrange the letters in encomiastic, you
get cosmetician, a dressed-up way of saying “makeup artist.”
