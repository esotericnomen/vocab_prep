When you concoct something, you mix up different ingredients. If you want to become a mad scientist
or a wizard, you'll have to learn how to concoct strange potions.

If the word concoction makes you think of steaming caldrons or liquids bubbling in test tubes,
you’ll be amused to know that it comes from a Latin word for “digestion.” Yum!   On summer
days, children sometimes concoct imaginative stews from grass, leaves and dirt. They may also
concoct lies to explain why they tried feeding such concoctions to their little sister.
