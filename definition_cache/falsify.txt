To falsify is to alter or mangle something, like a message or document, in a way that distorts the
meaning.

Since false things aren't true, to falsify something is to dishonestly change its meaning. If a
friend tells you a story, and then you retell the story but change important facts, you falsified
the story. If you lie in court â&euro;&rdquo; commit perjury â&euro;&rdquo; you're falsifying the
facts. Faking someone else's signature is another type of falsifying, as is lying on your resume.
Anytime you misrepresent the truth, you're falsifying.
