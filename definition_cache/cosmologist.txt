A cosmologist is a scientist who studies the universe. If you hope to become a cosmologist one day,
you'll want to take a lot of astronomy classes in college.

It's easy to confuse the words cosmologist and cosmetologist, though the jobs themselves are
completely different. A cosmologist focuses her studies on the structure and history of the entire
universe Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; how it formed, how it's changed, and what exists within it. A
cosmetologist, on the other hand, is an expert at hair styling and applying makeup. The Greek roots
of cosmologist are kosmos, order or orderly arrangement, and logia, discourse or dialog.
