Occlude means to obstruct, as with an opening. You hear this a lot in a medical context. Heart
surgeons are looking for occlusions in blood vessels––things that occlude the flow of blood.

Occlude does not exist only in a medical context. If you close the bathroom door so your little
brother won't come in while you're trying out makeup with your friends, you're occluding the
bathroom. Meanwhile, your makeup occludes your pores.
