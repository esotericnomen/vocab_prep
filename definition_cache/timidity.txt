Do you suffer from timidity? If so, you probably feel uneasy in new places and situations. You might
fear having to make decisions. But as you get more comfortable, your timidity will go away.

The noun timidity is related to the Latin word timidus, from timere, meaning “to fear.” In fact,
fear is often a cause of timidity — fear of the unknown, fear of not knowing what to do. For
example, you might experience timidity in visiting a country for the first time because you aren't
sure of the local customs or you don't speak the language well. Because you are afraid of
embarrassing yourself, you hold back.
