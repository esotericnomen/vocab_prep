If it has to do with money or currency, it’s monetary, like your childhood toy collection that has
no monetary value, but you love it nonetheless.

The adjective monetary is related to a Latin word that means “mint,” which is not just a
refreshing gum or ice cream flavor but, in this case, where money is made. Anything that pertains to
money can be described as monetary, like a country whose monetary system consists of metal coins of
different denominations or an antiques expert who can tell you the monetary value of the old things
in our attic.
