Musty is an unclean, stale and possibly moldy smell. If something smells musty that means it’s
probably been sitting in a damp corner without any air for a little too long.

Musty smells take time to develop: they’re caused by dampness and mold, and signal some amount of
decay. You might also call the smell of a musty old basement rank or foul. But people also use musty
to insult someone’s writing, or their ideas. A musty speech wouldn’t just be old-fashioned, it
would be old in a bad way: rotten and boring.
