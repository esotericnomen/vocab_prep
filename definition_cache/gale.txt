If there’s a gale coming your way, you better hold onto your new hat and your little dog, Toto,
too, because this is an extremely strong wind.

The word gale possibly originates from the Old Norse word galinn, which means “mad”,
“frantic” or “bewitched.” Weather forecasters sometimes use the term “gale-force winds”
to describe conditions that aren’t quite as extreme as hurricanes or tropical storms, but probably
fierce enough to snap your kite in half. It can also refer to other kinds of strong outbursts. For
example, if someone erupts into gales of laughter, it means her friend probably said something very
funny.
