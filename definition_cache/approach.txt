To approach is to get near something. An airplane is cleared for a final approach just as the wheels
approach the landing strip.

Approach comes from the Latin word appropriare which means go nearer to. You can physically approach
something, like a waiter going to a table. Or, you can approach a subject, usually one you're a
little nervous about -- like a new employee might approach her boss about getting a raise. Time can
also approach, like winter, midnight, or even old age.
