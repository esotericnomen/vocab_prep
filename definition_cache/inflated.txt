If it's puffed up and overrated, it's probably inflated — a simple adjective that means blown out
of proportion or exaggerated.

Think of a balloon. You blow and blow, and it gets bigger and bigger. Sometimes if you blow too much
it takes on a distorted shape, or even explodes. Now use that same imagery, but swap the balloon for
someone's ego or the price of U2 concert tickets. Both personalities and prices can get inflated
beyond reasonableness — the personalities with pretentious hot air and the prices with unnecessary
cost.
