The verb implicate means to connect or involve in something. For example, your cousins might
implicate you in the planning of a big party for your grandparents.

Implicate comes from the Latin word implicare, meaning to entwine, involve. When you implicate
someone, you bring him or her into a group or to pitch in on a project. Implicate can have criminal
connotations when it means to connect in an incriminating manner, like when detectives figure out
who drove the getaway car in the bank robbery Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; that person will be implicated for his
or her role in the crime.
