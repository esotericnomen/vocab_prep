While it looks a lot like celery, celerity means something that vegetables are not â€” fast moving.
Gossip often travels with celerity, as do children trying to get to a big plate of cookies.

When you see the word celerity, think accelerate, like a car when you step on the gas. Both words
share the Latin root celer which means swift. You may want to study for exams with celerity, but
using a slower, more methodical approach will often yield better results.
