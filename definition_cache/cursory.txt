No reason to get excited â€” cursory has nothing to do with bad language. Instead, it means not
paying attention to details, like friends who are so busy studying for a test that they only give
your new haircut a cursory glance.

Cursory dates to the early 17th century, from the French word cursoire meaning rapid, which comes
from the Latin word cursorius, meaning hasty, of a race or running. Something that is cursory is
done quickly, like a teacher who takes a cursory look at a pile of completed tests, not to grade
them, but to see if anyone attempted the bonus questions.
