Scrupulous means very careful to do things properly and correctly, such as paying friends back for
money borrowed right away, or not returning a pair of shoes after they've been worn outdoors.

A scrupulous person is full of scruples, which are concerns about doing things that are morally
right. Such a person is hesitant or doubtful, and might have trouble deciding what is morally right
or wrong. The adjective scrupulous is from Latin scrﾅｫpulﾅ行us, from scrﾅｫpulus scruple.
A near synonym is punctilious.
