A gratuity is a tip that's given by a customer in exchange for services. You might leave a gratuity
of several dollars when you eat lunch in a restaurant or when you get your hair cut.

A gratuity is usually a relatively small amount of money, a percentage of the total cost of a
purchase or service.  A gratuity doesn't pay for the goods purchased Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; it's a separate
reward to the person who did the work. For example, in the United States, waiters and waitresses
typically expect a gratuity of between 18 and 20 percent of the total cost of a meal.
