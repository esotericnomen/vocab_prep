Lethal refers to anything dangerous enough to cause death. The cobra's venom is so lethal that if
you get bitten and can't find the antidote, it's lights out forever.

Poisonous spiders, guns, knives, and radiation Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; all of these things can be lethal
because they have the ability to kill. Even some substances that on their own aren't dangerous can
become lethal in large quantities. Eating a peanut butter sandwich won't hurt most people, but it
can be lethal to those with a nut allergy. Words like deadly and fatal mean the same as lethal.
