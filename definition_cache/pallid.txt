Santa looks a little pallid, meaning that he has a pale complexion, from spending too much time at
the North Pole. A few days in Hawaii might do wonders to add color to his pale, bearded face.

Pallid means pale, or lacking color. It's often used together with complexion to describe someone
who has a pale face, either due to a lack of sunshine or some kind of emotional distress. A
reclusive author could be pallid from spending too much time indoors. His books can also be called
pallid if they're lacking in color and excitement.
