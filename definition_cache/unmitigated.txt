The adjective unmitigated describes something that is undiminished, unqualified, or absolute. If
your new recipe for chocolate cupcakes is met by enthusiastic cheers, you can assume you have an
unmitigated success on your hands.

Unmitigated comes from the Latin roots un-, meaning not, and mitigare, meaning made mild, soft, or
gentle. Perhaps because of these origins, although unmitigated can be used positively, as in
unmitigated success, but the word is often paired more negatively. You knew the wedding was going to
be an unmitigated disaster when the bride and groom didn't bother to show up at all, leaving the
guests to sit waiting for hours.
