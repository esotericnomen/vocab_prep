The adjective estranged suggests a loss of affection, a turning away from someone. When a couple
separates, we often refer to them as estranged â€” or no longer together.

The word estranged is an unfriendly word with a negative connotation. The word strange within it
seems to suggest an alienation of affection, and that a loving relationship has not only soured, but
turned distant and even somewhat hostile. While the word is usually used to describe a human
relationship, it can also refer to a political situation where nations that were once allies develop
conflicts and become estranged.
