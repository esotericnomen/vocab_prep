A soda and pizza binge might make your stomach distend, meaning your stomach will swell as a result
of pressure from the inside.

If you’ve ever eaten too much food it won’t surprise you to learn that the verb distend traces
back to the Latin words dis-, meaning “apart,” and tendere, meaning “to stretch.” Your
stomach will certainly feel stretched out if you do something — like overeat — that causes it to
distend. The word distend often applies to stomachs — a pregnancy would also cause a stomach to
distend — but it can also refer to anything that is stretched out as a result of internal
pressure.
