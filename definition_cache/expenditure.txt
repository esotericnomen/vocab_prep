In a trip budget, you need to add up all your expenditures, such as hotel, car rental and food costs
against the money you have brought to spend. An expenditure is money spent on something.

Expenditure is often used when people are talking about budgets. It is the government's job to
decide what to do with tax money collected, or in other words, to determine the expenditure of
public funds. The word is more than a long way of saying expense. In business, an expenditure
implies an investment, something that will bring value over time.
