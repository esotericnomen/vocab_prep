Marilyn Monroe and the triple loop roller coaster: What do they have in common? Some serious curves.
But you could only call the lady buxom, or totally voluptuous.

If she's a brick! House!, then she's certainly buxom. It's a polite way of saying stacked, quite
curvaceous, and especially well endowed in the bosom area. This body type used to be the ideal, long
before waifish supermodels took over the catwalk. Yet busty women everywhere are certainly holding
out hope that buxom makes a comeback.
