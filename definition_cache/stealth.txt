Stealth means to do something so quietly and carefully that no one notices, like the stealth of a
kitten sneaking up on a mouse.

Stealth and steal come from the same root word and used to mean the same thing. Stealth is still a
certainly a quality useful in stealing, but the meaning has branched out. It can also be something
quietly done in secret. For example, a stealth bomber is an aircraft that's hard to detect by radar.
Or if you plan a birthday party by stealth, then the guest of honor will be pleasantly surprised.
