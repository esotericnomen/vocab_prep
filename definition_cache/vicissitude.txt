When you talk of the vicissitudes of life, you're referring to the difficult times that we all go
through: sickness, job loss, and other unwelcome episodes. No one can escape the vicissitudes of
life.

While vicissitude comes from the Latin vicis, which means change and technically can mean a change
of any kind, you'll find that vicissitude is almost always used to talk about an unfortunate event
or circumstance. Losing a pet, crashing the car, being called in for jury duty: these are examples
of vicissitudes Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; chapters in one's life that one would rather avoid but must get
through. Some lives have more vicissitudes than others, to be sure, but no life is without events
that test and challenge us.
