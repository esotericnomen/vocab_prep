Your brother who spends money as quickly as he gets it, always wearing new clothes and taking
friends out for expensive dinners? You might call him a wastrel, meaning he spends his money
foolishly.

The word wastrel looks and sounds like waste, which means, as a verb, to spend or use carelessly
Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; as a noun, it's the thing that is not used effectively. A wastrel is someone who
tends to waste things, careless with anything from money to time, and everything else, too. You can
tell wastrels by behavior like running the water while brushing their teeth or spending every dime
they have on ice cream and luxurious sweaters.
