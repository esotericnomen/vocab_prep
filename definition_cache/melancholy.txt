Melancholy is beyond sad: as a noun or an adjective, it's a word for the gloomiest of spirits.

Being melancholy means that you're overcome in sorrow, wrapped up in sorrowful thoughts. The word
started off as a noun for deep sadness, from a rather disgusting source. Back in medieval times,
people thought that secretions of the body called humors determined their feelings, so a depressed
person was thought to have too much of the humor known as melancholy Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; literally black
bile secreted from the spleen. Fortunately, we no longer think we're ruled by our spleens, and that
black bile has been replaced by another color of sorrow: the blues.
