A postmortem is a medical examination of a dead body. It's a kind of autopsy done to learn exactly
how the person died.

In Latin, mortem means death, and post means after. A postmortem, logically enough, is something
that happens after death, usually an examination. Another type of postmortem is a meeting or
discussion that follows the completion of a project Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; this kind does not involve an
actual death, but simply the end of something, like an art installation or a business venture.
