When asked what the fundamental, or essential, principles of life are, a teenager might reply,
Breathe. Be a good friend. Eat chocolate. Get gas money.

Fundamental has its roots in the Latin word fundamentum, which means foundation. So if something is
fundamental, it is a key point or underlying issue â&euro;&rdquo; the foundation, if you will
â&euro;&rdquo; that the thing is built upon.  Teachers argue that math fundamentals include
memorizing the times tables and understanding long division. Many people would also argue that math
fundamentals should include knowing how to use a calculator and knowing where the calculator's extra
batteries are kept.
