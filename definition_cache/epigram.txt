An epigram is a short, clever remark. One of Oscar Wilde's many memorable epigrams is I can resist
everything but temptation.

Epigram comes from the Latin word epigramma, which means an inscription. If you've ever seen an
inscription on, say, the back of a watch, you know the writing has to be brief. It won't surprise
you, then, that epigrams are very short poems, sayings, or famous quotations, like Benjamin
Franklin's Little strokes fell great oaks, a memorable reminder to keep working toward big goals or
to pay attention to little details, the opposite of an epigram from our era: Don't sweat the small
stuff.
