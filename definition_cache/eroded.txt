When cliffs are gradually worn away by currents and pounding ocean waves, we say they have been
eroded.

Eroded comes from the Latin word erodere to eat away. It doesn't just refer to things like sediment
and dirt. If someone is consistently unreliable, your confidence in that person will gradually
become eroded.
