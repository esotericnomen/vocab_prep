To bowdlerize means edit offensive parts out of something. If the hero in an R-rated movie adapted
for TV  exclaims, “Oh shoot fudge darn!” but his lips seem to be saying something else, that
movie has been bowdlerized.

The word bowdlerized comes from the name of Dr. T. Bowdler, who decided to publish an edition of
Shakespeare without sexual references or double-entendres (which is when a word has two meanings,
one of them cheeky). Mr. Bowdler thought he was performing a great service for humanity, but
generally if we call something bowdlerized, we’re implying that it was edited in a prudish way.
