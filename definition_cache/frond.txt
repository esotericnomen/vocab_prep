A compound leaf — that is, a leaf with many fine and deep divisions — is a frond, such as on
ferns and palm trees.

Although commonly referring to the leafy part of a fern or palm, the noun frond can also refer to
anything that has a similar shape to a palm frond or fern frond. If your bedhead is really bad,
people may joke about your combing your fronds. In parts of the United States and Canada, you may
eat the fronds of fiddlehead ferns, which are cooked and served as a vegetable.
