once in a while.

If you have a bad cough that comes and goes, you could call it an episodic condition. When used in
this way, episodic suggests that the cough appears at irregular, or random, intervals. Episodic can
also describe the way certain stories are told. An episodic narrative is a story that is told
through a series of episodes, or segments. A soap opera on television, for instance, is an episodic
program.
