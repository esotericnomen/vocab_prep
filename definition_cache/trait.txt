A trait is something about you that makes you you. When your mother says that you get all your best
traits from her, she means you have the same charming smile and the same brilliant mind as she has.

In science, trait refers to a characteristic that is caused by genetics. Having green eyes or being
shorter than average are traits a person might have. In more general use, a trait is an important
part of someone’s personality or appearance. Try to describe your favorite teacher in three words
and you’ll probably come up with a list of her essential traits — such as compassionate, calm,
and kooky.
