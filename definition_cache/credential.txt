A credential is something that’s proof of a claim you make about yourself or your skills. You
might earn a credential in computer networking that lets employers know that you’re qualified to
do the job.

A credential can be a particular qualification that you earn or it can refer more generally to
achievements or qualities that you’ve acquired over time. You’ll most often see the word
credential used in its plural form: credentials. You typically refer to your credentials to show
that you're qualified to do something. Your strong academic credentials might qualify you to work as
an assistant at a hip magazine during the summer.
