Dispirited means being down in the dumps or depressed. Losing his girlfriend and job on the same day
could make someone dispirited â€” feeling gloomy and absolutely miserable.

You could describe people who are dispirited as having no spirit. Whether they've broken up with
someone they loved or failed to get a promotion they've been working hard to earn, they feel sad,
blue, and lack any sort of enthusiasm.
