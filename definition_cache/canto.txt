Long books have chapters. Long poems do, too. But a chapter in a long poem is called a canto.

There are several famous poems that are divided into cantos, including Dante's The Divine Comedy and
Lord Byron's Don Juan. Canto is an Italian word coming from Latin which means song or singing. From
Italian it was borrowed in English to mean a section of a poem.
