Have you ever screamed horrible things during a sports event, or taunted someone with cruel jokes?
You might be a heckler, and you’re probably not very well-liked.

The word heckler is rooted in an old Dutch verb that means “to irritate, prickle,” and hecklers
can be irritating indeed. They sit at baseball games and yell insults at the players, or start
booing during a spelling bee. Some comedians love hecklers and often will start heckling them back.
Other comedians will jump off stage and attack a heckler — so keep that in mind if you feel like
adding heckler to your résumé.
