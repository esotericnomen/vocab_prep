If you are a coach with a losing team that doesn't listen to you, don't be surprised if you are
called ineffectual. It means too weak to produce the desired effect.

Ineffectual as a word is similar to ineffective, but while ineffective implies that something simply
doesn't work, ineffectual carries with it the idea of weakness too. A broken baseball bat is
ineffective, a baseball bat made out of felt? Ineffectual.
