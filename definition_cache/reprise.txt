Reprise means repeat an earlier role. If youâ€™re asked to reprise your role as kid entertainer at
the annual family reunion, that means people want you to do it again this year.

Early on, reprise was a part in a song or other musical composition that is repeated. The word still
carries that meaning, but now it's more likely to be used as a verb to describe an action or part
that is repeated, often a performance. For example, if you played a role in a wildly successful film
that is going to have a sequel, you would reprise your role. The word comes from the French word
repris, meaning take back.
