To loll means to hang around lazily without doing much at all. It's a great pleasure to loll about
in the park instead of going to work. But your boss might have a problem with it.

Loll means to droop, or hang loosely. We usually use it to describe the behavior of hanging loosely,
like lolling about on the beach reading a book. Sometimes itâ&euro;&trade;s the perfect word for a
drooping object. If you take your dog for a long run in the hot sun, its tongue will loll out of its
mouth. If you fall asleep on the bus ride home, your head might loll onto your
neighborâ&euro;&trade;s shoulder.
