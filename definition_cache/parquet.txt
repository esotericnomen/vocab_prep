It must take a very long time to create a parquet floor. This type of woodwork includes many small,
intricate pieces laid out in a geometrical pattern, almost like a mosaic.

Parquet is a French word that rhymes with tray. In fact, this type of woodwork originated in France
and seems to have first been used on the floors at the Palace of Versailles. It is decorative in
nature and can be used for flooring and also for furniture, such as tabletops. Sometimes parquet is
also used to describe the main seating area in a theater Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; closest to the orchestra,
or stage.
