To undermine literally means to dig a hole underneath something, making it likely to collapse. But
we more often use the word to describe sabotage or the act of weakening someone else's efforts.

Originally spelled with a ‘y’ instead of an ‘i’, undermine has Germanic roots and means to
weaken, hinder, or impair. Accidentally undermine the foundation of a house by digging a tunnel to
China beneath it and you might be forgiven. Undermine your teacher’s authority by speaking out of
turn and throwing spitballs and odds are you’ll get in trouble.
