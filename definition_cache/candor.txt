Candor usually means the quality of being open, honest, and sincere. If someone tells you they think
you are dumb, you might reply with, While I appreciate your candor, I don't think we need to be
friends anymore.

The corresponding adjective is candid, as in I want you to be candid. Do these pants make me look
fat? Candor is from French candeur, from Latin candor, from candÄ“re to shine, be white. The color
white is associated with purity, which is a now obsolete meaning of candor.
