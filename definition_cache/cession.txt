Cession is the act of giving up something, usually land, by the agreement in a formal treaty. For
example, after a war, a losing country might make a cession of part of its land to the victor.

The meaning (and spelling) of the word cession, began with the Latin word meaning a giving up and
retained that meaning throughout the word's evolution, passing through Old French and Middle English
pretty much untouched. We can see its relationship to other words, such as secession, which is the
idea of one government breaking away from another, or giving up the connection between them, as
happened in our own country and led to the Civil War.
