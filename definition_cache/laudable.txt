Use the word laudable to describe something that deserves praise or admiration, like your laudable
efforts to start a recycling program at your school.

When you break apart the word laudable, you can see the verb laud, meaning praise or acclaim,
followed by the suffix -able, which is a tip-off that this word is an adjective. So laudable
describes things that are worthy of praise, such as a laudable effort to end poverty, and it can
also describe admirable ideas or beliefs, such as a laudable compassion for others.
