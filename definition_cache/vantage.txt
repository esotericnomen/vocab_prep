A vantage is a really good place from which to survey a scene. You might find that the roof of the
house offers an excellent vantage from which to drop water balloons on your kid brother’s head.

Vantage is a variation of advantage, but when we use vantage we’re almost always talking about a
position, not just general superiority. If you had extra tutoring for a big exam, you would have the
advantage over a classmate who didn’t. But if your seat for the test allowed you to see the answer
sheet lying on the desk, well then you would have a superior vantage — not that you would take
advantage of that, of course!
