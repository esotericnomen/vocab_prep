A jerk is a sharp, sudden movement. When you're learning to drive a stick shift, it’s hard to
avoid the jerk and lurch when you try to change gears. Jerk is also a very unflattering term for an
obnoxious person.

Although you will most commonly hear the derogatory jerk as in Don't be such a jerk, there are many
other meanings of the word. Clean and jerk is an Olympic weightlifting event where you lift a
barbell in one clean movement, then, in one quick thrust — the jerk — you lift the weight above
your head. Jerk can also mean making a sharp, sudden move — like a dog jerks on his chain. You may
have eaten jerk, also called jerky — strips of dried meat — handy for lunchboxes and camping.
