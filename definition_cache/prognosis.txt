Prognosis concerns people who are so sick they might die. What is their prognosis? It is a word
doctors use to talk about the path a disease will take with a person.

Prognosis comes from the Greek pro- before and gnosis knowledge. It means to know beforehand, but
keep in mind that it is only a probable outcome and not a sure thing. Financial analysts frequently
change their prognosis of the economy as they hear each piece of good or bad economic news. And if
the weather prognosis is sunny and dry, but you see dark clouds forming, you would be wise to pack
an umbrella.
