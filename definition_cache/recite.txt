You are showing off your ability to recite when you repeat the entire text of The Gettysburg
Address, or name all the past winners of your townâ€™s asparagus eating contest.

Recite entered the English language as a legal term but is now more often used in the realms of
education, literature, and religion. Children in school may be assigned a famous poem to recite in
front of the class or be tested on how well they can recite their multiplication tables. In many
religious traditions, being able to recite passages of sacred texts is an important part of
practicing the religion.
