Scurry means to move quickly, at a frenzied pace, and often also implies the urge to hide. When you
come upon a mouse in your house, chances are it will scurry away.

Think of scurry this way Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; anytime you describe someone as scurrying, you're comparing
them to a mouse. When you say troops scurried back behind their defensive lines, you're insulting
them. When you say children scurry around searching for eggs during an Easter egg hunt, you think
they're cute.
