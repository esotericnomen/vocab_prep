If you force material through an opening to give it form or shape, you are extruding the material.
You can use a pasta maker to extrude the pasta dough in various shapes â€” from spaghetti to
linguine to macaroni.

Extrude is from the Latin word extrudere, which itself can be broken into the roots ex-, meaning
out, and trudere, meaning to thrust. In the noun form, the process is called extrusion. You can
extrude all kinds of materials and products by forcing them through an opening, including cheese
puffs, pasta, candy, plastic toys like the hula hoop, assorted pipes and hoses, and glass tubing.
