In everyday use, liquid is the opposite of solid––water at room temperature is a liquid: Heat it
to boiling, it turns to a gas. Chill it below freezing, it turns to ice.

Liquid describes a state in which a compound such as water flows. Juice is a liquid. Milk is a
liquid. Your swimming pool is full of liquid. When assets are liquid, that means they can be
liquidated easily, i.e., sold for cash. Stocks and bonds are liquid assets. Real estate, which can
take a long time to sell, is considered illiquid.
