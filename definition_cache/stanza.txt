Stanzas are the building blocks of formal poetry, like paragraphs in a story or verses in a song.
They usually have the same number of lines each time, and often use a rhyming pattern that repeats
with each new stanza.

Shakespeare was the master of the stanza.  His sonnets had three stanzas that were each four lines
long, and then a two-line stanza at the end, all with a very particular rhyme and rhythm pattern.
Poems with stanzas always have some sort of structure to them, but not all poetry uses stanzas, for
example Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; free verse tends to be wild poetry without structural rules.
