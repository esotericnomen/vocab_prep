When you watch an action movie, the hero's deadly fusillade often results in at least one of his
enemies being shot. The noun fusillade describes a quick round of gunfire.

To correctly pronounce fusillade, say FEW sill ahd. The word probably reminds you of fuselage, the
part of an aircraft where crew members and passengers sit. But the words only sound alike. Fuselage
gets its name from its cylinder shape, while fusillade comes from the French word fusil, meaning
musket. Fusillade also can be used in a figurative sense to describe a rapid series of anything,
such as a fusillade of punches or a fusillade of questions.
