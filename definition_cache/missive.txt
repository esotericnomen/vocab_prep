A missive usually refers to the old-school style of hand-written communication on paper (remember

The noun missive comes from the Latin word missus, meaning to send.  You may have heard the phrase,
fire off a missive, meaning a note, memo or dispatch that was written and sent with urgency and
conveyed an important message. It might have been a missive sent from a commander to the troops,
telling them of a change in the battle plan. Or, maybe it was an urgent love letter to the
commander's wife back home, telling her to tie a yellow ribbon round the ole oak tree...
