Use the adjective vituperative to describe criticism that's so sharp it hurts. A vituperative review
of a movie would make the director bitter for months.

To correctly pronounce vituperative, remember that the first vowel sound is the long i sound, and
the second syllable is accented: vie-TOO-per-uh-tive. Being vituperative takes criticism to the next
level. Vituperative criticism is harsh, scathing, even abusive. If a review or assessment is
vituperative, it doesn't say try harder next time. Instead it gives the sense of go away and never
come back.
