Use the adjective implicit when you mean that something is understood but not clearly stated. You
might think you and your boyfriend might have an implicit understanding that you are going to get
married, but it's probably better to talk it through.

A very near synonym of implicit in this particular meaning is the word implied. But the adjective
implicit  also means complete without any doubt, so we can say that we have implicit trust or
confidence in someone. The Latin root implic√Ñ re means to involve or entangle. Another English word
with a more obvious connection to the Latin is the verb implicate.
