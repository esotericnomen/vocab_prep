Something tautological is redundant and circular, especially when talking about logic. Logical
things are logical is a tautological sentence.

We use the word tautological for statements that go in a circle, like this sentence: A circle is
circular. This is a logical problem, because it doesn't make sense to define something in terms of
itself. If you don't know what a fish is, then fish are fishy means nothing. When you're trying to
make a point, avoid tautological statements.
