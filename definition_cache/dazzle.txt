To dazzle is to blind someone for a moment with light, like a deer in the headlights. You can also
dazzle by impressing people, and not just by wearing a sparkly sequined shirt.

Have you ever had a light shine in your face so you couldn't see for a second? You were dazzled. To
dazzle is to blind someone in this way. A car's high-beam lights can dazzle other drivers. Looking
directly at the sun is a way to dazzle yourself. Dazzling puts you in a daze for a second. Also,
anything impressive can dazzle. A great writer dazzles readers. An impressive speaker dazzles
listeners. It's like you're blinded by their brilliance.
