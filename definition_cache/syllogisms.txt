A syllogism is a type of logical reasoning where the conclusion is gotten from two linked premises.
Here’s an example: An apple is a fruit. All fruit is good. Therefore apples are good.

Used properly, syllogism can be a good way of reasoning, but it’s very easy to make sloppy
syllogisms by messing up the middle term that links the premises together, as in: President Franklin
Delano Roosevelt was an Aquarius. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt was great. Therefore all
Aquariuses are great. Because so many are made poorly, the syllogism has a bad reputation. Poor,
misleading, or tricky reasoning is often called “mere syllogism.”
