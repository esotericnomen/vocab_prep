To shuffle is to drag your feet slowly along the ground as you walk. A kid might shuffle reluctantly
off to his room only after being told five times that it's bedtime.

Shuffle also means to wiggle around, like if you shuffle uncomfortably in your seat while watching a
five-hour movie. If you get lost in the shuffle, you√¢&euro;&trade;re lost in the crowd. Another way
to use shuffle is to mean mix up in a random way, as you do with a deck of cards before dealing a
hand. Shuffle probably comes from the Low German word schuffeln, which means both to walk clumsily
and to deal dishonestly.
