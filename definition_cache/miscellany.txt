Miscellany is a collection of different sorts of things. If organization is not one of your strong
points, your purse may contain a miscellany of surprising items.

Miscellany comes from the Latin for mix, and a miscellany is a mixture of things. If you don't clean
your car out very often, there may be a miscellany of relics in the backseat: a flip flop left over
from your last trip to the beach, a few stale French fries, your last report card, and maybe a
magazine or two.
