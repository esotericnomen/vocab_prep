Remote describes something far, far away, like a campsite way out in the woods, a distant planet, or
the chance you'll win the lottery.

The Australian outback is remote, since it's hard to get to and there aren't many people there. It's
also remote in the sense that it's far away from civilization. Someone with a faraway look in her
eye, not answering your questions is also remote. Remote can describe something unlikely, like that
lottery win. You might win, but your chances are so remote you shouldn't count on it.
