Miraculous, magical, and maybe a little mysterious, an elixir is a sweet substance or solution that
cures the problem at hand.

Elixir is a word often used with a knowing wink Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; a sort of overstatement of a
product's effectiveness, or a decision maker's policy. With linguistic roots in the long-ago
alchemists' search for the philosophers' stone, the word has an element of fantasy to spice up
anything, like a remedy for the common cold. The mythic fountain of youth is certainly an elixir,
but it can also refer to a real liquid, concept, or plan.
