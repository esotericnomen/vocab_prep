Let's start over. That's what someone might say when he or she needs to recast something, meaning to
make major changes that make something seem very different or even brand new.

When you recast something, you arenâ&euro;&trade;t just improving it slightly â&euro;&rdquo;
something that is recast typically involves significant changes to the original. As it applies to
actors' parts in a movie, television show, or play, to recast a part means finding a different actor
to play it. When you recast a metal item, like a piece of jewelry, the item is melted down
completely and then remade in a new form. When teachers get blank stares from students, they recast
their questions to make them less confusing.
