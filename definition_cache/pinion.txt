Many cars use rack-and-pinion steering, in which the steering wheel turns a small-toothed pinion
gear, which engages the larger rack that turns the car's wheels.

Pinions make steering easy and smooth. Pinion, in the sense of a gear, comes from Middle French
peignon, which comes in turn from the Latin noun pecten, comb, reflecting the toothed appearance of
a pinion.
