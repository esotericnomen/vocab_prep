First is number one, prior to, or before. First comes first, then comes everything else. It's always
good to be first in line or in first class. Who wants to be second? Or worse — last?

Whether it’s a noun, adjective, or adverb, you’ll find first at the beginning and opposite from
last. And whether you’ve won first place or have just become the First Lady, first usually
indicates a good thing — unless of course you're first to be fired. That doesn’t answer the
Abbott and Costello question “Who's on first?” though.
