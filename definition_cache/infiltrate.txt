If you infiltrate a group or organization, you join it in order to gain information, like an
employee of a donut shop that infiltrates the competition to try to learn its secret recipe for its
delicious dough.

Infiltrate is a verb that is familiar to international spies and undercover agents, who are all
adept at joining a group under false pretenses, fitting in, and working their way up to the highest
ranks in order to find out as much information as they can about the group. The word can be used
more broadly to describe anything that stealthily becomes a part of something else, such as slang
words that infiltrate our everyday speech.
