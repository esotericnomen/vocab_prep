A monarch, such as a king or queen, rules a kingdom or empire. In a constitutional monarchy, the
monarch's power is limited by a constitution. But in an absolute monarchy, the monarch has unlimited
power. Monarchy is an old form of government, and the word has been around a long time. It derives
from Greek monarkhi√Ñ , from monarkhos monarch.
