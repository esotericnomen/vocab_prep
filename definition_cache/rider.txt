Riders are people who are in motion â€” riding bicycles, subways, horses, roller coasters and much
more. Another kind of rider is a special list that comes, or rides along with a contract.

The noun rider means one who rides, but its other meaning is a document that is added to legal or
official documents. On Capitol Hill, lawmakers add riders to legislation documents to try to get
certain stipulations to be part of new laws. You may have heard of touring musicians who demand that
certain rare flowers be placed in their hotel rooms, which must Italian linen sheets on the bed, and
be exactly 71 degrees. It's all in the rider of the tour contract.
