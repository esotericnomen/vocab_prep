Coiffure is a fancy French word for hairdo. If you spend a lot of time working on your coiffure, you
spend a lot of time in front of the mirror fixing your hair.

The word coiffure originally meant hairstylist, now it means the style. The word implies an
elaborate style, not just a regular haircut. A beehive hairdo, for instance, would be rightly called
a coiffure. A military-style buzz cut is just a trim. The word can be shortened to coif, but be
careful as this word has other meanings as well.
