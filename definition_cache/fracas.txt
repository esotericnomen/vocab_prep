If your marching band gets into a fight with another school's pep squad, your principal might say
the fracas was uncalled for and undignified. A fracas is a noisy quarrel.

Fracas comes from an Italian word meaning uproar or crash. Two people in a quiet little spat is not
a fracas, but a schoolyard rumble definitely qualifies as one! Sometimes fracas means the large
amount of outraged discussion that an event causes. Imagine the fracas if your school decided to ban
sneakers!
