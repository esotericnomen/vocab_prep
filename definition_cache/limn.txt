Limn is a verb that means to represent or portray. It is most often used to describe the act of
drawing or painting a portrait, but it can also refer to describing or outlining a scene or event.

The verb limn evolved from the Latin luminÄ re, to illuminate. The word referred originally to
coloring (illuminating) manuscripts. The sense of portray or depict did not come into use until the
late 16th century, but that meaning is close to the original, since someone who paints a portrait
usually illuminates something about the subject's character. The word is less often used of written
description, as in Her reviews tended to limn the worst aspects of the performance, ignoring the
best.
