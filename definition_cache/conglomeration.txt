Conglomeration is a fancy word for a bunch of stuff brought together. People, companies, ideas, and
other things can group together in conglomerations.

If you ever want something and you're asked why, you could show off your vocabulary and say, I have
a conglomeration of reasons! That means you have a bunch of reasons that may or may not be
connected. A huge mob of people could be described as a conglomeration — which sounds nicer than
mob. The with should be a reminder that this is a word that brings things or people together. In the
dictionary, you'll find a conglomeration of words — like conversation and concert — that use
con- to suggest a bringing together.
