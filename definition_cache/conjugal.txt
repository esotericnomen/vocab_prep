The adjective conjugal describes all husband-and-wife matters, so if someone who is married says,
Single people don't understand how I feel, you can be sure it's a conjugal situation.

The word conjugal comes from the Latin word, conjux, meaning husband, wife. You’ve no doubt heard
of the term “conjugal visits,” to describe private visits between a prisoner and a spouse. But
it can describe anything that happens between married people, such as conjugal obligations, which
are the things you do to keep a marriage going, or just general conjugal, or married, life.
