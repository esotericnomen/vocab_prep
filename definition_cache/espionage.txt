It's no secret: espionage is the act of organized spying, usually with the goal of uncovering
sensitive military or political information.

If the government has relocated you to a foreign country, made you change your name, given you a
fake mustache to wear, and instructed you to hide in a closet at the presidential palace and report
back weekly on what you overhear, then you are engaging in espionage. This noun is similar to
snooping, but generally applies to much more serious situations, like when countries or businesses
spy on each other to try to obtain top secret information.
