When you pamper your dog, you spoil him. You might pamper him by feeding him cubes of cheese and
knitting him a little sweater and letting him sleep in your bed under the covers.

Some people love to pamper their pets, cooking them special food and buying them expensive collars
and toys. To pamper goes beyond kind treatment, bordering on overindulgence or coddling. People also
like to pamper themselves from time to time, getting a massage or a manicure, or otherwise being
treated indulgently. The word pamper originally meant to cram with food, most likely from a Middle
Dutch root meaning to cram.
