When you nourish your imagination or your body, you give it what it needs to stay healthy and
flourish (hey, that rhymes!).

Whenever you eat a nutritious meal, you nourish your body. You can also nourish your dreams by
allowing yourself to take chances and try what interests you, even if you're not sure what the
outcome will be. To transform the verb nourish into an adjective, you can just add ing. Then, you
can describe things that nourish you â&euro;&rdquo; like protein shakes or good poetry
â&euro;&rdquo; as nourishing.
