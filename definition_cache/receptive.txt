To be receptive is to be open to new ideas or change. If you’re responsive to other people’s
suggestions and not set in your ways, then you’re not only receptive, but flexible.

The adjective receptive actually comes from a Latin word that means receive. So a receptive person
is willing to receive things, especially opposing arguments, constructive criticism, and helpful
hints. How receptive you are speaks to your willingness to have an impression made upon you. It can
be good to be large and in charge sometimes, but you can also benefit from stepping back and being
receptive to what life brings.
