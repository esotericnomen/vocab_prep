Fallible means capable of making mistakes — or, easier to remember — capable of failing.
Infallible means exactly the opposite — incapable of failing.

This word is often used to describe human capacity for error — no one is infallible. And yet, we
are able to be infallible in certain ways: children are infallibly curious, teenagers infallibly
hungry. Interestingly, infallible derives from the Latin in- not + fallere deceive. When did making
a mistake and deception become the same thing?
