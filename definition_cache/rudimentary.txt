Rudimentary is a pretty long and fancy word, for a word that just means stripped down or at a very
early stage. The test should be easy: it requires only a rudimentary understanding of the materials.

The word rude means simple or offensiveâ&euro;&ldquo;â&euro;&ldquo;people with only rudimentary
understanding of good manners might not know how that belching is rude. Remember that the word rude
is the foundation of rudimentary you'll have a rudimentary understanding of the word.
