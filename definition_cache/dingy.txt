The adjective dingy comes from uncertain origins, but experts suspect in may be a backformation from
the word dung, which is animal excrement. So you can imagine how dirty, dismal, grungy, and grimy
something described as dingy is.

The adjective dingy is often, but not always, used to describe one's clothing or living space. The
homeless man's dingy clothes were no longer suitable for wearing, but he wore them anyway. This
hotel is too dingy, and I am not staying here! she exclaimed. Asked by the hotel manager where the
hotel was dirty and grimy, she twirled in a circle pointing at the walls, ceiling, floors, and other
surfaces, while shouting, Are you blind? Everywhere!
