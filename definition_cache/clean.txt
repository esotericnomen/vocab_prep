The meaning of clean usually refers to removing something unwanted: you clean your hands by washing
them, then you can clean some grapes.

This word has many meanings related to being pure or empty. You clean a chicken by plucking its
feathers, or get cleaned out when you lose all your money at poker. If a drug addict is clean, he's
no longer using. You can clean someone√¢&euro;&trade;s clock, clean up your act, or clean out a safe
and make a clean getaway. If the floor is clean enough to eat off, it's very clean. A clean life is
morally pure.
