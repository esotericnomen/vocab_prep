Use the noun deadlock to describe a standstill, as when two people or sides cannot move beyond a
disagreement.

Deadlock can also mean a game that results in an unbreakable tie or a stalemate, like when you are
in a five-hour thumb-wrestling match with no winner. You can easily remember the meaning of this
compound word, by thinking about its two word parts — dead + lock. The first appearance of
deadlock was in The Critic, a play by Richard Brinsley Sheridan: “I have them all at a deadlock,
for every one of them is afraid to let go first.”
