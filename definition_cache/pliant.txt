The adjective pliant describes something that is capable of being bent. The teenager showed off her
pliant spine every time she draped herself over a piece of furniture. Why hanging upside down off
the sofa didn't give her a headache, her mother would never know.

Pliant has both a literal and a figurative meaning. Pliant can describe something that is bendable
â&euro;&rdquo; like a spine, a tree branch, a bendy straw â&euro;&rdquo; or it can describe
something that is flexible, but less tangible. In this latter sense, pliant describes something that
adjusts to conditions or is easily influenced: In order to survive the recession, the company had to
be pliant and adjust to the new economic conditions.
