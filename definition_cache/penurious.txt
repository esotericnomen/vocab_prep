Don't have two nickels to rub together? You're penurious â€” a lovely long way of saying you're flat
broke.

Penurious also means a general dislike of spending money. If someone accuses you of being cheap,
tell them you prefer to be thought of as penurious. It sounds so much classier. It's related to a
similar word, penury, which means a state of extreme poverty.
