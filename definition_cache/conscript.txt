If you’re ever drafted into the Turkish army, then you could be called a conscript, someone who is
forced to join the military.

At the root of conscript is the Latin word conscriptus, meaning “enroll.” Conscript does involve
enrollment — but it’s a forced enrollment, used to describe someone who has been forced to join
the military, such as someone who has been drafted. As a verb, conscript means force to join, like a
military that conscripts new soldiers. In contrast, those who choose to join are recruited; when
they enter the service, they enlist.
