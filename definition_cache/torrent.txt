A torrent is a heavy rain, or the flooding or wildly-running streams it causes, like the torrent
that soaks everyone unlucky enough to be out on the street at that moment.

Because the noun torrent literally means rushing stream, it is often describes fast-flowing water,
like a rainstorm or creeks and rivers that overflow their banks. But the word can also describe any
sudden inundation, like a deluge of words or thoughts, like when, in anger, you unleash a torrent of
emotional words on your friend. Like a violent storm, you pour those words, not letting up in order
to let him or her explain the other side of the story.
