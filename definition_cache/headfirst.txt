When you do something headfirst, your head leads the way. For example, a boy might show off by
diving headfirst into a chilly lake.

The adverb headfirst is useful for describing a dive or a movement that leads with the head. A
stormy ocean might fling a swimmer headfirst onto the beach, or an unlucky skier could slide
headfirst down a mountain. You can also use headfirst in a more figurative way, to describe
something that's done impulsively, or in a foolishly hasty manner: He plunged headfirst into this
new relationship two days after breaking up with his girlfriend.
