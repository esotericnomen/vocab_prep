If someone's willing, he has the quality of willingness, which can vary from meaning prepared, to
enthusiastic, like your little brother's eager willingness to help walk the dog.

If your troop of Girl Scouts has a willingness to try anything, it means they stay cheerful and
ready, even if they're hiking through a prickly field of thistles. When something is done with
willingness, there is no sense of resentment or hesitation. The word's origin lies in the Old
English wyllan, to wish, desire, or want.
