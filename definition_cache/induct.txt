Induct is what groups do when they formally accept new members, like the honor societies that, every
school year, induct students who meet the qualifications.

When you induct someone into a group, you formally welcome him or her as a member. The word is
typically used to describe official acceptance of a position or admittance into an organization,
such as a professional society. It can also be used to describe someone who has formally enrolled in
the military. Don't use it for informal joining, though Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; you wouldn't induct a new
friend or be inducted at the gym where you have just started a membership.
