Carping is petty and unjustified criticism that just won’t stop. People who find fault with you at
every turn, who appreciate nothing and complain, complain, complain, are carping. Enough already!

Your annoying aunt Mildred who constantly picks on you, listing all the things she thinks are wrong
about the way you dress, the style of your hair, who you’re dating, and where you’re working?
She’s carping. Carping can also be used as an adjective, to describe someone who is overly
critical and impossible to please — like that carping food critic who ruined the debut of your new
restaurant.
