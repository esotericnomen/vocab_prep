Certain high-end brands have a particular cachet, or respectability. People just know they are the
finest of their kind.

The word cachet comes from the French cachet meaning seal affixed to a letter or document, and if
something has cachet, it's as if it has a seal of approval from society. If you start a design
company selling cachets for people to seal their letters with fancy wax, try getting some
celebrities to endorse it. Then your cachets will have cachet Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; and that's fancy.
