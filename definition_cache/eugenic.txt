Eugenic is the idea that self-selecting genetic characteristics, such as hair or eye color, can
improve a race. The Nazis' eugenic plans to create a master race of blonde, blue-eyed people marked
one of the darkest periods in the twentieth century.

The word eugenic traces its roots from the Greek word eugenes, meaning well-born. The field of
eugenics aimed in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries to improve the characteristics of a race by
promoting certain qualities in its offspring, which they then would pass on to future generations.
But it also tried to prevent people with unfavorable qualities from procreating. This philosophy has
greatly fallen out of favor since World War II, especially among biologists.
