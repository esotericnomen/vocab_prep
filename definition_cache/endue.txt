You probably hope that your years of ballet classes will endue you with the ability to dance like
Baryshnikov. In other words, you're dreaming that all of those arabesques and pirouettes will
provide you with the dancing talent you wish for.

Endue is a fancy literary term that shows up most often in formal writing, but you could impress
someone by using it to mean endow, invest, or empower. Less often, endue is used to mean to put
clothes on, or dress, which makes sense when you know that endue comes from the Latin word induere,
or to put on.
