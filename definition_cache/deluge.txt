Feeling overwhelmed, like you're underwater? You might be experiencing a deluge â€” like when you've
been given a deluge of homework over vacation: a dozen term papers, two dozen books to read, and a
mile-high stack of math problems.

The noun deluge is an overwhelming amount of something in general, such as work, people, or
questions. Because of its Latin roots, however, in particular it means an overwhelming amount of
water. It comes from diluvian, which means flood. The verb deluge similarly means to overwhelm or
inundate with something, particularly water. The hurricane deluged the island with rain. A deluge
isn't always a bad thing, however. One thing most people would like to be deluged with? Money.
