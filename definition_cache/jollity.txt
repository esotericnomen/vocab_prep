Use the noun jollity to describe having fun and being in an extremely good mood, like the jollity
you feel when you are with your best friends at your favorite amusement park.

You can see the word jolly in jollity and that is a big clue that it means full of cheer and good
will. We might say that Jolly Old Saint Nicholas — Santa Claus — is the king of jollity. But you
can join his court — you are the picture of jollity when you are laughing uncontrollably with good
friends or whooping it up at a Country Western dance. We are talking mirth and merriment: that's
jollity.
