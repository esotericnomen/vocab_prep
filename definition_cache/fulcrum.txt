The supporting point of a lever, the first fulcrum you met was probably on the playground — right
underneath the see-saw.

Back in the 17th century, a fulcrum referred to any general prop or support. Today it’s taken on
more scientific connotations, thanks to Physics class. However, people still use fulcrum to describe
something that plays an essential role or serves as the center of an activity or situation, such as
the “fulcrum of the debate.” Or that mom who organized everybody’s playdates? She was the
fulcrum of the playground social circle.
