Senility refers to mental deterioration and infirmity that often comes with old age, as in severe
memory problems. If your find your shoes in the fridge or accidentally call your son by the dog's
name, you may wonder if senility is kicking in.

Senility is related to the word senile, which itself is from the Latin word senilis, meaning of old
age. There are subtle differences between senility and Alzheimer's disease, which causes memory loss
as well as emotional and behavioral changes. If you suspect someone you care about has senility
issues or Alzheimer's disease, you should consult a physician because treatments may be available to
help slow the process.
