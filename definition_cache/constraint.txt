A constraint is a limit or restriction. Hopefully your school won't cut the sports or music programs
due to budget constraints!

You might notice that constraint is similar to the verb constrict, as in boa constrictor. A
constraint tightens around you like a snake and prevents you from doing what you want. Financial
constraints prevent you from buying the latest electronic device. Are you tired of living under the
constraint of your parents' rules? Sometimes your worries or feelings act as a constraint. You know
that someone has become a close friend when you can talk to them without constraint.
