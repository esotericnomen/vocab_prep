If you think that the shape of a person's head can tell you everything you need to know about him,
you believe in phrenology, or the study of skulls.

Phrenology is outdated today, but it was a popular area of study in the nineteenth century. It was
considered a pseudoscience, or false science, even at the time, yet phrenology was taken seriously
by some psychiatrists and neurologists, who would feel a patient's head for bumps they believed
revealed aspects of personality, character, and health. The literal Greek meaning of phrenology is
mental science, from the root word phrenos, or mind.
