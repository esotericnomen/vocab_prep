If you're unsure of whether to buy the car, you may ask for more information about it.  Information
is knowledge you gain from studying, investigating, or experiencing something.

If your brother unfairly accuses you of finishing the ice cream that was in the freezer, you might
respond by saying, For your information, it was already gone when I got home! You are conveying
information to your brother, but in an annoyed and sarcastic way.  Sarcastic or not, information is
related to the word inform, whose Latin roots, in and form, basically mean what they sound like:
form into. When you gain information, you are forming an idea.
