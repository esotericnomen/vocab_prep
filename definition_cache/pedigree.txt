The noun pedigree refers to the genetic background of an animal, although it is sometimes applied to
people as well. A purebred dog, for example, comes with a verified pedigree, a list of all past
parentage.

The preoccupation with pedigree isn't new -— the concern for human pedigree can be seen in the
Bible, where generations are meticulously recorded. Pedigree, referring to a genealogical chart,
appeared in 1410 from the Anglo-French pe de gru, meaning foot of a crane, referring to the
chart’s tree — like lines, which looked like the print of a crane's foot. The importance of
pedigree extends to animals such as dogs and horses, with breeders careful to follow the animal's
lines to assure purity.
