Reactionary describes people on the far right politically. Reactionaries occupy a political space
past conservative, near where ultra-conservative bumps shoulders with fascist.

A reactionary is someone reacting (in horror) to what most of the world considers to be progress. No
one describes themselves as reactionaryâ&euro;&ldquo;â&euro;&ldquo;you will hear it more often as
a condemnation, as in I cannot support the reactionary policy of mandatory military service for 18
-year-olds.
