If you appreciate something, you recognize its value. We can all appreciate how refreshing cold
lemonade is on a sweltering summer day.

The oldest meaning of appreciate is to know the worth of something: The parolee appreciated his
newfound freedom. A related sense is to be grateful for something, but this usage can sound wordy.
Instead of I would appreciate your sending me more information, consider: Please send me more
information. The word can also be used (without a direct object) to mean to rise in worth: The
vintage Corvette would appreciate in value over the years.
