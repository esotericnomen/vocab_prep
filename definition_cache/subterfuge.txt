If you want to surprise your mom with a sweatshirt, but don't know her size, it might take an act of
subterfuge, like going through her closet, to find it out. Subterfuge is the use of tricky actions
to hide, or get something.

It's pronounced SUB-ter-fyooj. As a countable noun, a subterfuge is a tricky action or device: She
employed a very clever subterfuge to get the information she needed. Subterfuge is from French, from
Old French suterfuge, from Late Latin subterfugium, from Latin subterfugere to escape, from subter
secretly, under plus fugere to flee.
