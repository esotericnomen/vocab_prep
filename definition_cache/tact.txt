To talk carefully without hurting anyone’s feelings, that’s tact.  Politicians have tact, which
makes them good at speaking about sensitive matters without making fools of themselves.  At least,
sometimes they have tact.

Around a friend who’s afraid of snakes, you use tact when talking about reptiles because you
don’t want to upset them.  The Latin root word tangere means “touch,” and a person with tact
avoids touching dangerous words like they are an electric fence.  When you say something without
tact, you “put your foot in your mouth,” as the phrase goes.  You don’t literally put your
foot in your mouth, although if you did you’d avoid offending people with words.
