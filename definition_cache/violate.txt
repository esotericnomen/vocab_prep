Violate is a verb that describes actions that show no respect for people, laws, property, and
customs, like drivers who violate the law when they fail to stop at red lights or those who violate
your privacy when they eavesdrop on your personal conversations.

Violate comes from the Latin word violatus which means to break, as in a promise or oath. As members
of our society, we make unspoken promises — to follow all laws, to help people if we can, or at
the very least, not hurt them. So when we violate — laws, property, people's abilities to live
safe, peaceful lives — we break the promises that come with being lawful citizens.
