Someone with courage is bold and brave, unafraid to face tough challenges. Unlike the Cowardly Lion,
who went all the way to the Emerald City to see if the Wizard had any courage to spare.

In Middle English, courage referred to “what is in one’s mind or thoughts. Today, anyone with
courage has only fearless feats and courageous acts in mind. Having courage means acting when others
are afraid of the danger, or simply acting without fear of failure. As the American poet Robert
Frost advised, “Have courage and a little willingness to venture and be defeated.”
