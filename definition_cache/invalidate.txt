If administrators find out that students cheated on a test, the school might invalidate their class
grades. To invalidate means to cancel something or make it void, as if it never happened.

In invalidate you see the word valid which means true or correct. When you invalidate something you
are making it less true, less official, or less correct. If you buy something that doesn't work
properly and then try to fix it yourself, you invalidate the warranty. If you have a wacky theory
that cars grow from trees, your teacher might invalidate your theory by taking you on a tour of an
auto factory.
