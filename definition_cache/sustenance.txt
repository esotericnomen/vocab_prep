Sustenance comes from the word sustain, which means to continue. Sustenance is food or drink that
allows you to continue to be alive. For many, prayer is a source of spiritual sustenance.

If your chief source of sustenance is candy, you are going to get sick, but you will have a good
time while it lasts. In much of the world, rice and beans provide sustenance to human beings. In the
US, Native Americans taught Europeans how to grow corn, which turned into a major source of
sustenance for their population.
