Wedding vows and vault combinations that canâ€™t be broken are considered inviolable. (Of course,
divorce lawyers and bank robbers consider this a challenge.)

The word can refer to a physical structure (a fortress, for instance) or something more conceptual
(human rights or morals, perhaps). Inviolable has changed little from its Latin origin of
inviolabilis, which combines the prefix in- (meaning not) with the verb violare (to violate).
Inviolable turns up in religious settings too, usually in reference to texts or rites. In that
context, it means sacred. No surprise: the antonym of inviolable is violable (accessible or
penetrable).
