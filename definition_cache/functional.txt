Use the adjective functional to describe something that is made to do a specific job, such as the
functional alarm clock feature on a digital stopwatch.

The word functional comes from the Latin word functionem, meaning performance, execution. It can
also describe whether something is working properly. This is what shoppers at a garage sale want to
be sure of before they leave with an old television Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; they plug it in to make sure
it's functional. In this case the opposite of functional is useless.
