The word fashion has to do with customs and trends. Popular clothes are in fashion. And someone who
keeps up with the latest styles is a follower of fashion.

The most common use of fashion is to describe the hippest, trendiest clothes and music
Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; we say popular things are in fashion. But this word can also refer to a way
something is done, as in We train dogs in a certain fashion. To fashion something means to built it,
as in We fashioned a shelter out of rocks and mud. But that kind of fashioning probably isn't in
fashion these days.
