Stand up when the powers that be order you to sit down, and you've given a fine example of defiance.
It happens when someone or a group of someones openly flouts or challenges authority.

We owe this lovely descriptive term to the French — specifically to the Old French word defier,
which means to defy. (Don't mix it up with deify; that means to make someone or something into a
god.) If you've ever studied Latin, you'll spot the fi from fidare to trust that inspired the
Marines' semper fi motto and the popular moniker for pooches––Fido. Combining fi with de-
negates it. So an act of defiance is essentially an act of not trusting.
