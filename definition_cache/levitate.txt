To levitate is to float in the air, defying gravity. It also means to cause something to do that.
With a magnetic force — or a magic wand — you might be able to make your teacher levitate above
your classroom.

Levitate comes from the Latin levis, meaning “light.” Something that is light can levitate
easily. Magicians levitate things like pigs and snowmobiles and women as part of their shows. In
architecture, certain structures can be raised or suspended so as to appear to levitate.
