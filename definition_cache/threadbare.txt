Those jeans you wear every day that have holes in the knees and thin patches in the rear? They're
threadbare. Threadbare means thin from overuse.

Furniture, clothing or a rug is threadbare if the fabric is thin and worn through. If your father
tells the same jokes over and over again, you might accuse him of having a threadbare sense of
humor. A friend who chooses to live a threadbare lifestyle doesn't have a lot of things, and what
they do have is not in the best of shape. When you see this word, picture your childhood stuffed
animal with the fur rubbed thin from too much cuddling.
