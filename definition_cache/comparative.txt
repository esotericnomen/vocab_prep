The word comparative deals, naturally, with comparisons, looking at characteristics of two or more
things. For example, you might study a course such as comparative literature, which examines works
from two or more cultures or languages.

Coming from the Latin verb compar√Ñ re, to compare, comparative worked its way into Late Middle
English as an adjectival form indicating comparison. In the comparative form, the adjective either
ends in -er (my hands are smaller than yours are) or uses the word more before it (you are more
qualified than the other applicants are). The word also can offer an estimate rather than an
absolute.  You might be a comparative beginner in cooking class, but your ham still won the prize.
