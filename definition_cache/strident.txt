Feminists are often characterized by people who don't like them as strident. Strident describes
their voices, raised in anger, as loud and harsh. Being a strident feminist isn't very ladylike. But
making less money than a man when you do the same work is worse.

Strident is related to the Latin word strix screech owl. This is a kind of owl that doesn't hoot. It
screeches in a strident way. Don't confuse strident with striding, which means walking quickly, with
a wide step. If you're angry at your brother, you might come striding into his room and begin making
a strident case for why he has done you wrong.
