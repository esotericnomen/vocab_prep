Use the adjective hapless to describe someone unlucky and deserving of pity, like the hapless used
car buyer who gives in to the fast-talking salesperson.

The word hapless traces all the way back to the Old Norse word happ, meaning “chance, good
luck.” Combine this with the suffix -less (“lacking”) and hapless means “unlucky” or
“ill-fated.”  A traveler who goes to Moscow and briefly gets lost on the subway? Just a tourist.
A traveler who goes to Moscow, accidentally eats food he is allergic to, somehow loses all his
money, and by chance gets on a train destined for Mongolia? Definitely hapless.
