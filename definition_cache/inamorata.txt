If you want to sound a little old-fashioned, you might refer to your girlfriend as your inamorata.

A woman you love in a romantic way is your inamorata, although it's not a very common term these
days. It would be a little startling if your friend said, I'd like to introduce you to my inamorata,
though you'd know he meant the woman I love. The male version of an inamorata is inamorato, which is
even more rarely used. Both words come from the Italian innamorare, to fall in love.
