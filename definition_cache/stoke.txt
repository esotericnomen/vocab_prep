To stoke is to poke a fire and fuel it so that it burns higher. It can also mean incite––a
principal's impassive silence in the face of requests for more tater tots might stoke the flames of
student anger.

When a surfer says, I am so stoked, it means they are excited––the fire of enthusiasm is burning
hotter. It's interesting to reflect on how many words in our language have to do with the tending of
fires, an activity that has become much less common in recent human history.
