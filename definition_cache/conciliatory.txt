If you're in a fight with a friend and you want to end it, you should make a conciliatory gesture,
such as inviting her to a party you're having. Conciliatory describe things that make other people
less angry.

The context is often a situation in which a dispute is settled by compromise. A synonym is
propitiatory, though this adjective usually refers to avoiding the anger of someone who has the
power to harm. In the word conciliatory, the Ã¢&euro;&ldquo;ory suffix means relating to or doing,
and the root is from Latin conciliatus, from conciliare to bring together, win over, from concilium
council.
