You might get an odd look if you ask your hairdresser to put your hair in a plait, but she’ll
eventually figure out what you want: a braid.

Plait, which sounds the same as plate, feels a bit like it’s from a bygone era, though the word is
still in use today. A woman wearing a hairstyle with plaits might be on her way to meet Lord
Something-or-Other, in the hopes of receiving a marriage proposal. Meanwhile, someone wearing a
braided hairdo might be preparing for a night on the town or just a trip to the grocery store.
