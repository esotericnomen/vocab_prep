We love words that sound like what they mean, and bolt is no exception. It's a quick, sharp word
that either means to move quickly or refers to a stroke of lightning, as in lightning bolt.

The god Zeus was fond of tossing bolts of lightning down upon mortals who angered him. If you were
one of those mortals, you'd have been smart to bolt inside as soon as the rain began. To bolt is to
run as quickly as you can. Racehorses are often described as bolting out of the gate. Other uses of
bolt include the lock in your door, the act of locking that lock, and what a dog does when it gulps
down his food.
