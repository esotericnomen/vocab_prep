Smaller than the chicken and not as well known as the pigeon, quail is like the often-overlooked
middle child of the ground-dwelling bird family. Everyone always asks, “What’s that one’s name
again?” about this bird. Every time.

Quail is a broad, catchall word; it can refer to any one of many small domestic game birds.  So if
you’re bragging about the quail you shot on a hunting trip to your uptight, bird-obsessed pals,
they might demand to know if it was the Bobwhite quail, the Valley quail or the Scaled quail, to
name just a few.
