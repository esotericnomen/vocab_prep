Sometimes you just need a little nudge or slight push to get your day going. It might be a coffee,
or your favorite song, or your mom stripping the covers and standing over your bed.  Take your pick.

Some people believe the word nudge comes from the Norwegian dialect nugga meaning to push, rub. This
makes sense, since a nudge is a push of sorts. But it's more of a gentle push. Think of nudging
coals around in a fire or a crowd of people nudging to the stage at a concert.  When you gently
annoy your husband so he'll mow the lawn, you're nudging him along.
