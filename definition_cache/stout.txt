Stout describes something fat, dependable, or rugged. If someone calls you stout, ask them exactly
what they mean before bursting into tears and skipping dinner. It could be a compliment!

Most supermodels would not want to be described as stout, which is often a nicer way of saying fat.
But a little teapot doesn't mind being short and stout. Something stout is dependable, too, like
your favorite snow boots that keep your feet dry winter after winter. Since it also means sturdy, if
you call that supermodel stout when he prances through the finish line of a triathlon, he'll just
pump his fist in agreement.
