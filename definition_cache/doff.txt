Use the verb doff to describe removing something. You probably always doff your cap before the
playing of The Star-Spangled Banner.

The word doff and its antonym don date to the mid-14th century. Doff is a contraction of do (take)
off, and don is short for do (put) on. By 1755, these words were all but obsolete, but they came
back into vogue thanks to Sir Walter Scott, author of works like Ivanhoe, Rob Roy, and The Lady of
the Lake. The popular Scottish author used them frequently, and he and his readers kept doff and don
alive.
