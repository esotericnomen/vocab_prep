To capsize is to overturn, and it usually happens to boats. Don't rock the boat, baby, or you might
just capsize.

When a boat tips over in a lake, it capsizes, and so does a boy who is sitting on an inner tube when
it flips suddenly. Anything overturning in a body of water can be said to capsize. Sometimes vessels
that capsize can be righted, like a canoe, and other times they sink to the bottom of the sea. The
origin of capsize is uncertain, though it may be related to the Spanish word capuzar, sink by the
head.
