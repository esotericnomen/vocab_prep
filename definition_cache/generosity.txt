Generosity is a quality that's a lot like unselfishness — someone showing generosity is happy to
give to or share time, money, food, or whatever with others.

Generosity is a quality — like honesty and patience — that we all probably wish we had more of.
When you show generosity, you might give away things or money or put others before yourself.  But
generosity is about more than cash and stuff. When you're forgiving and gentle to people, you show
generosity of spirit. If you give others help or credit, that shows generosity. The world would
certainly be a better place if more people showed generosity to others.
