The person who looks closely at every penny might not be cheap — he might be a numismatist, a coin
collector, looking for old or rare coins that somehow got into the mix.

To correctly pronounce numismatist, accent the third syllable: new-miz-MUH-tist. It literally means
someone who studies coins. These aren't the coins you have in your pocket right now. Instead, a
numismatist studies and collects coins from other places and time periods. The word comes from the
Latin word numisma, meaning coin, currency. The word numismatist was coined — no pun intended! —
in 1799.
