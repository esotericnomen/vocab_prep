Drama is highly emotional. It can happen on stage, like a performance of Hamlet, or in a gaggle of
7th grade girls, breathlessly dissecting why so-and-so broke up with what's-her-name.

The word drama comes directly from Greek, meaning action or a play. Which is no surprise, since
ancient Athens was a hotbed of dramatic theater. The earliest recorded actor was a Greek named
Thespis, and actors today are still called thespians in his honor. Drama doesn't always take place
on the stage, though. You can use the word, sometimes with a roll of the eyes, to describe behavior
or a reaction to a situation that appears a little overly emotional.
