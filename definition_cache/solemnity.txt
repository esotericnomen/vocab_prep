Put on a straight face when you think of the word solemnity; it is used for occasions that are all
about seriousness and dignity.

The word solemnity has been around since the fourteenth century helping people describe the mood of
occasions ranging from funerals of beloved public figures to ceremonies welcoming United Nations
dignitaries. This is the noun form of the adjective solemn, and you’ll often see it used with
“of,” as in “the solemnity of the occasion called for hushed voices.”
