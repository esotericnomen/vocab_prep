Use the noun phonology to describe the study of the way sounds are used in a language and the rules
for pronouncing certain words, like the silent t in the French word chat.

You're most likely to hear the word phonology in a college linguistics class, learning about the
meanings of specific sounds in various languages. You might hear the terms phonetics and phonemes in
the same class, both of which have to do with sound, speech, language, and meaning. All of these
words have their roots in the Greek word for voice, phone, and in the case of phonology, the Greek
suffix logy, which means study, science, or theory.
