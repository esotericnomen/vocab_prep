To clamor is to make a demand — LOUDLY. It's usually a group that clamors — like Americans might
clamor for comprehensive health care coverage.

The noun clamor is often used specifically to describe a noisy outcry from a group of people, but
more generally, the word means any loud, harsh sound. You could describe the clamor of sirens in the
night or the clamor of the approaching subway in the tunnel.
