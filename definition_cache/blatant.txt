Something blatant is very obvious and offensive. Don't get caught in a blatant lie, because you
won't be able to weasel your way out of it.

Blatant acts are done without trying to hide them. This adjective is probably from Latin blaterare
to chatter, croak or Latin blat朝re to chatter, gossip. A near synonym is flagrant.
