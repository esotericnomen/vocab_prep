Unlike a pickle or a chipmunk, a human is a person. You can identify a human by the two legs it
stands on, its upright stature, its high intelligence, and its speech that you'll understand if
you're one, too.

Human was first recorded in the mid 13th century, and owes its existence to the Middle French humain
“of or belonging to man.” That word, in turn, comes from the Latin humanus, thought to be a
hybrid relative of homo, meaning “man,” and humus, meaning “earth.” Thus, a human, unlike
birds, planes, or even divine spirits up above, is a man firmly rooted to the earth.
