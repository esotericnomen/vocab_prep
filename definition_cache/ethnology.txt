Ethnology is a science that deals with the study of humans, looking at everything from the question
of where we all come from to analyzing data about how we choose to live our lives now.

With roots in the Greek ethnos meaning people, nation, race and logia referring to the study of,
ethnology takes into consideration culture, language, religion, race, and social structure. Unlike
ethnography, which focuses on a single group, ethnology compares and contrasts more than one culture
with the goal of better understand humanity as a whole.
