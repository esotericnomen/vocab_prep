Uproarious situations are very loud, a little out of control, and often hilarious. You might
encounter an uproarious crowd at a soccer match, or even in your school cafeteria.

Your neighbors might like to throw uproarious dinner parties filled with screams of glee and
pounding music, disturbing your sleep. Notice the word roar in there, because whether it’s an
uproarious gathering or just one uproarious joke, it’s always an event of stunning and dramatic
volume, like a lion’s roar.
