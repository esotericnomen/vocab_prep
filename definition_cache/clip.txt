Use the noun clip to talk about a fastener that holds things together, like a paper clip or a hair
clip.

A clip keeps loose things attached to each other, but when you clip something, you cut small pieces
off of it. Think of when you clip your dog's toenails or clip the dangling ends off the blanket
you're knitting. You can also use the verb clip for a figurative kind of cutting, like when you clip
two minutes off your marathon time or clip your words â&euro;&rdquo; say them quickly and tensely
â&euro;&rdquo; when you're angry.
