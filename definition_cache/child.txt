A child is a young person who's typically older than a baby but younger than a teen. As a child, you
probably had your parents watching over you as you played in a sandbox.

The noun child come from the Old English word cild, meaning child, infant.  Retaining a similar
meaning into modern times, the word still refers to a young person, male or female. But you can be
considered a child after reaching adulthood Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; in the eyes of your parents, at least.
Immature behavior like throwing a temper tantrum can also mark you as a child. The word can also
refer to someone in a clan or tribe, young or old.
