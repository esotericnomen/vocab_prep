To inculcate is to teach through frequent instruction. If you repeatedly tell your brother how
important it is to be responsible, then you’re trying to inculcate in him a sense of
responsibility.

The word inculcate traces back to the Latin word inculcare, meaning “to force upon or to stamp
in.” If anyone has even tried to inculcate you with something, it may seem as if something is
being stamped into your brain — over and over and over. A key thing to remember about this word is
repetition: something, such as a value or a belief, is instilled in the brain by the persistent
restating of its importance.
