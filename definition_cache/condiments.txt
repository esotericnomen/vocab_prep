A condiment adds flavor to food. Ketchup and mustard are popular condiments.

Most people use condiments when they eat. There are lots of salad dressings, and they're all
condiments. If you put relish on a hot dog, that's a condiment too. Barbecue sauce and blue cheese
are condiments as well. If it's an extra thing â&euro;&rdquo; especially a sauce like ranch
dressing â&euro;&rdquo; and it makes food taste better, it's probably a condiment.
