The verb rail means to criticize severely. When you rail against increased taxes at a town meeting,
you speak openly and loudly about how wrong the increase is and point out the problems it will
cause.

Rail can also mean to complain.  When your mom asks you to vacuum the house, you might rail against
this chore by saying that you ALWAYS do the vacuuming, that vacuuming is SO hard, and that you hate
the stupid vacuum! Rail can also mean to spread negative information about someone in an abusive
way. If your friends rail against you to everyone in school, they're spreading nasty rumors about
you, and you should find new friends!
