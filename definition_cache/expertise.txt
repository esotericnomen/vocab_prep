When you're an expert at something, you show expertise â€” or an exceptional knowledge of the
subject. He had expertise in accounting, having excelled in math, but he had even more expertise in
dancing, his hobby since a small child.

Expertise has obvious roots in the word expert. Just about any interest or field has a place for
experts. Just as one individual has expertise in world religions, another may have expertise in
computer gaming. Working hard or immersing yourself in a specialty leads to expertise, and it comes
through both study and hands-on experience.
