The noun diffidence refers to a lack of self-confidence. Your diffidence might be the reason why you
never say hi to the cute guy or gal in the elevator or why you never ask for a raise.

The noun diffidence comes from the Latin word diffidere meaning to mistrust or to lack confidence.
Diffidence is often mistaken for snootiness because people don't understand that the diffident
person is shy and lacking in confidence. They asked him to be the team leader, but he expressed
diffidence, saying that he didn't think he had enough time to do the job justice, nor did he think
he had enough experience.
