A ravenous person feels like they haven't eaten in days and could probably finish off 10 pizzas
without help. So ravenous is not a good state to be in when you go grocery shopping.

Back in the early 15th century, you would have been called ravenous if you were greedy and obsessed
with stealing, much like a pirate. Nowadays, it√¢&euro;&trade;s often used to describe extreme
hunger or desire. Having a ravenous appetite means you're literally hungry like the wolf, snarling
and growling (stomach) included. So do everyone in the lunchroom a favor and remember to eat
breakfast.
