The word effeminate is used to describe a man or a boy with characteristics that are more often
associated with females.  You were once teased for your effeminate, high-pitched voice, but now
you're a world-renowned singer.

The adjective effeminate comes from Latin roots that mean womanish. The term is usually meant as an
insult.   You once thought it was too effeminate for a man to carry a purse, but now you realize how
convenient it is.  Besides, you often use it to swat at anyone who makes fun of you.  If you think
it's effeminate to cry during sad movies, that explains why you watch them alone.
