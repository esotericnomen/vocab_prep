If something is bovine, it has to do with cows or cattle, or it reminds you of the slow and
seemingly unintelligent ways of cows and cattle. Someone's glacial pace and dull comments might
contribute to his thoroughly bovine impression.

The adjective bovine is used for anything that has to do with animals from the genus
â&euro;&oelig;Bos,â&euro;? which classifies wild and domestic cattle.  Mad Cow Disease is
technically known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, and it can be said to have bovine origins.
What are known as cow pies are, in fact, bovine droppings. People can be described as bovine if they
are intellectually dull, slow-moving, or somewhat cow-like in their appearance.
