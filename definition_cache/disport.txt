Visitors to an elementary school during recess may be surprised by the way the kids disport
themselves. Disport means to play in a carefree way or to amuse yourself in a lighthearted fashion.

To correctly pronounce disport, accent the second syllable: dih-SPORT. It comes from the French word
desporter, which means to carry away or to entertain. Think of disport as what kids do when they
have so much fun playing that they get carried away, forgetting all about school until the bell
rings. You might disport yourself by frolicking at the beach with friends and enjoying lively
conversation.
