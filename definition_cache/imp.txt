An imp is a trouble maker — not a thug or a criminal, but a mischievous sort who might make prank
phone calls or harass a substitute teacher.

Impe is an Old English word meaning young plant shoot. It was eventually applied to the offspring of
people and later used pejoratively in the sense of offspring of the devil. The devilish meaning
remains, but an imp can also be any mischievous person, especially a small child. You might call the
boy you babysit an imp if he's in the habit of playing tricks on you — like locking you out of the
house.
