A vertebrate is an animal that has a backbone and a skeleton. Vertebrate animals include humans.

When you think about vertebrates, think about bones: this word has to do with animals that have a
lot of bones, in the form of a skeleton. It especially refers to animals with a backbone, which
protects their spinal cord. Vertebrates have many bones, including a skull which protects their
brains, which tend to be large. People, dogs, horses, lizards, dogs, cats, and many other animals
are in the vertebrate category. Animals without a backbone are called invertebrates.
