Retrograde describes moving in a backwards or reverse direction. If you're suddenly told that you
can no longer vote because you're a woman, that's a retrograde affront to your civil rights. Start
protesting!

This word comes from the Latin retrogradus, meaning going backward. You might hear retrograde used
in astronomy to describe the movements of the planets. If a planet like Mercury is in retrograde,
that means it appears to be moving backwards. Retrograde can also describe something that's going
from better to worse. The farm's retrograde practice of spraying their crops with harsher and
harsher pesticides is causing our health to suffer.
