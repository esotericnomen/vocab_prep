A lien is a claim against the property of someone who owes money. It's pronounced like lean, which
might also describe your meager finances if a lien has been placed on your home.

When someone doesn't make payments on a loan, the bank may put a lien on that person's property,
claiming ownership of that property until the overdue payment is received. The word lien derives
from the Latin lig√Ñ re, which means to bind, and you can see that binding, or tying up a person's
property, really does put the owner in a bind.
