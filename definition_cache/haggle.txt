If you want a great deal on a used TV, then you can try to haggle with the sellers to see if
they’ll bring the price down. To haggle is to negotiate or argue over something, usually a price.

You can haggle at a flea market or anywhere where the price of items is flexible. But haggle
doesn’t always refer to price. You can haggle over a job, a contract, or who gets to ride in the
front seat. Haggling is relatively aggressive behavior, and this word is closer in meaning to
wrangle than it is to negotiate. You’ll rarely hear of anyone haggling quietly. Haggle implies an
argument in which both parties want the best deal for themselves.
