Are you always challenging the establishment? Or provoking popular thought by attacking traditions
and institutions? Then you're definitely an iconoclast.

To be called an iconoclast today is usually kind of cool Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; they're rugged
individualists, bold thinkers who don't give a hoot what tradition calls for. But back in medieval
Greece, the iconoclasts had a more thuggish reputation. Stemming from the Greek words eikon, meaning
image, and klastes, meaning breaker, an iconoclast was someone who destroyed religious sculptures
and paintings.
