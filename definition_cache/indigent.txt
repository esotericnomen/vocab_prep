An indigent person is extremely poor, lacking the basic resources of a normal life. Often the
indigent lack not only money but homes.

Indigent comes from a Latin word meaning wanting, which we used to use to mean
â&euro;&oelig;lackingâ&euro;? and not just to describe desires. Homeless shelters, soup kitchens,
free medical clinics and court-appointed lawyers are all institutions that our society has developed
to help indigent people.
