Doctors and researchers who study the process of human aging call their field gerontology.

There is a slight difference between gerontology and geriatrics, which is the the branch of medicine
that focuses on the health and ailments of elderly people. Gerontology overlaps with geriatrics, but
it is more specifically the science of the aging process as well as the physical and psychological
issues that people deal with as they get older. The word gerontology comes from a Greek root,
gerÄ¹?n, or old man.
