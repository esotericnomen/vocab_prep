A sextant is a tool for measuring the angles between heavenly bodies — the kind found in outer
space.  Used as a navigational tool out at sea, it helps determine a ship's longitude and latitude.

There is nothing sexy about a sextant, unless you're a sailor. Even then, in today's world of
sophisticated instrumentation, it's considered quaint and old-fashioned. The noun sextant dates back
to the late 16th century, from the Latin word sextans, meaning sixth part. The sextant uses a
graduated arc of 60° (there's the six reference) for measuring the altitude of the planets and
stars.
