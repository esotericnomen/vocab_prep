Ornithology is the scientific study of birds.

Zoology is the broad field that studies animals, but there are as many subfields as there are
critters. One is ornithology: the study of birds. This includes tiny birds like finches and huge
birds like vultures. Ornithologists study bird songs, feathers, migration patterns, and everything
else about birds. People who are experts in ornithology â&euro;&rdquo; ornithologists
â&euro;&rdquo; go to graduate school, but you don't have to study birds in school to be interested.
Birdwatchers know a lot of ornithology too.
