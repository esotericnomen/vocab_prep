A soothsayer is someone who can foretell the future. If the convincing soothsayer at the state fair
tells you you'll soon meet someone tall, dark, and handsome, you'll probably keep your eye out for
someone who fits that description.

A fortune teller is also known as a soothsayer, or someone who claims to be able to predict the
future. Long ago, a soothsayer might have been considered a useful consultant, even for a
government, but today soothsayers are more likely to be scoffed at. Still, there are many
soothsayers who have successful businesses telling people's fortunes and giving advice. Soothsayer
comes from the Old English word for truth, combined with say, together meaning an act of speaking
the truth.
