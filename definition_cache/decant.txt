The verb decant means to pour. Kids moving water back and forth between two cups, your dad pouring a
bucket of soapy water in the sink, or a wine expert emptying a bottle of wine into a fancy glass
container — all of them are decanting liquids.

When you decant, pronounced dee-CANT, something by slowly pouring it from one bottle to another, you
may feel a little bit like a mad scientist or an alchemist. That image would be appropriate, since
early on decant was used by alchemists to describe the process of separating a liquid from a
sediment by careful pouring. Today, wine lovers do just that — decanting wine to avoid any solid
bits — but pouring any liquid can be described as decanting.
