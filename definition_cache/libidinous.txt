When you're libidinous you're driven by your libido, meaning your sex drive. When you describe
someone as libidinous, it's usually not a compliment, since the word suggests being out of control
with lust and desire.

The proverbial dirty old man exemplifies libidinous gone wrong. It's not that lust is necessarily
bad, but making a fool of yourself is. The word libidinous comes from the Latin word libido, meaning
desire, a word the world relearned from Sigmund Freud in the early 1900s. Freud believed that the
libido â&euro;&rdquo; sexual energy â&euro;&rdquo; is one of the powerful motivating forces for
people and that psychological health is determined by how well a person controls and focuses it.
