When you have faith, you trust or believe in something very strongly. Some people have faith in a
higher being, others put their faith behind the Red Sox.

This noun comes from the Old French word feid, meaning “faith, belief, trust, confidence,
pledge.” It's often used when describing religion or the supernatural: people have faith in God,
or actually refer to the religion they practice as their faith. Some choose to have the same amount
of faith in a good friend or a well written recipe — anything that will come through for them in a
time of need.
