A cohort is a group of people who are around the same age, like a cohort of college students who
have similar experiences and concerns.

The word cohort was originally used to describe a military unit in ancient Rome. You can see how
this retains traces of the word’s origins: cohorts are bound together by similar circumstances
just like a group of soldiers in a military unit. Some  language purists insist that the word only
describe a group, such as a cohort of accountants, but it can also refer to companions or
supporters, such as “Susie and her cohorts.”
