Molten describes an object that's reduced to liquid form by heating. You're probably familiar with
lava, the molten rock that explodes out of a volcano.

Molten originated from the Old English verb meltian, meaning become liquid. It takes incredibly high
temperatures to get an object that was once rock solid to be transformed into a liquid state.
Something much safer than lava has made the term molten popular Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; molten chocolate
cake. This cake has a center that's filled with hot, gooey pudding-like chocolate that oozes out.
This is probably the only molten thing you'd ever want to touch.
