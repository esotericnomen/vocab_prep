Something that has no material form or physical substance can be described as incorporeal. If you
believe in spirits or ghosts that can't be touched or seen but only felt, then you believe in the
incorporeal.

Incorporeal comes from a combination of the Latin root words in- meaning not and corpus meaning
body. Combined they form incorporeus, meaning without body, which is precisely what something
incorporeal is. A haunted house is plagued by incorporeal, or immaterial spirits. You don't see
them, but they are there, rattling windows, slamming doors, scaring the living daylights out of you.
