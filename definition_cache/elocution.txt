If you're particularly good at elocution, or speaking clearly and expressively, you may have a
successful career in radio ahead of you.

Elocution is the skill of pronouncing your words correctly. There are even elocution coaches for
actors, singers, or anyone else who wants to improve theirs. Elocution sometimes describes a
particular style of speaking, like an announcer's elocution that sounds like he's from the Bronx.
The Latin elocutionem is its root, meaning manner of expression; in Classical Latin it meant public
speaking or oratory.
