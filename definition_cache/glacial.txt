Things that are glacial are super cold. A place can be glacial — like the South Pole — but a
person can be glacial, too, like that unfriendly girl who gave you a glacial stare.

The word glacial is related to the word glacier, which is a huge piece of ice. If something or
someone is glacial, that thing or person is icy. You can give someone you don’t like a glacial
look, or you can go skiing on a glacial morning. Glacial comes from the Latin glacies, which sounds
like the name of a frozen dessert, but which actually just means ice.
