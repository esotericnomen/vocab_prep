Canon is all about authoritative standardsâ€”for literature, sainthood, or behavior. Don't confuse
it with cannon with two n's, the big gun that shoots bowling-size balls at the enemy.

College students used to read what was called the literary canon, until they noticed that they were
written by dead white men. Pretzels dipped in Coke may be tasty, but they're not ready to be entered
into the canon of two great tastes that go well together: oreos + milk, donut + coffee, apple pie +
ice cream.
