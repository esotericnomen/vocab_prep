Something tacit is implied or understood without question. Holding hands might be a tacit
acknowledgment that a boy and girl are dating.

The adjective tacit refers to information that is understood without needing to acknowledge it. For
example, since we know that the sky is blue, that kind of assumption is tacit. Lawyers talk about
tacit agreements, where parties give their silent consent and raise no objections.
