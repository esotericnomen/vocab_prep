When a group wants to govern itself or a person wants to make independent decisions, they are
looking for autonomy.

Autonomy comes from the Greek roots auto meaning self and nomos meaning custom or law. This reflects
the political sense of the word Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; a group's right to self-government or self-rule.
When a person seeks autonomy, he or she would like to be able to make decisions independently from
an authority figure. Can you relate?
