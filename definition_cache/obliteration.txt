Obliteration is the total destruction of something, so that nothing remains of it. Holding a lit
match up to a balloon might cause its obliteration.

The noun obliteration can describe a literal destruction, like an explosion or terrible fire, but
it's also frequently used to mean a more figurative kind of eradication. You might, for example,
hear people on the news talk about the obliteration of democracy in a country, or the obliteration
of a politician's candidacy after a scandal is revealed. The word comes from the Latin obliterare,
cause to disappear, blot out, or erase.
