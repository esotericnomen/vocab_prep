When water flows slowly in tiny drops, it drips. The movement of water in this way is called a drip.

Have you ever had a leaky faucet? Then you probably know a drip is water leaking out one drop at a
time: drip drip drip. A broken faucet has a drip, and you can say the water is dripping. When it
rains, it usually starts dripping before it rains harder. When you turn on the shower, it might
start as drips. Once the water is flowing strongly and in a stream, it's not dripping anymore.
