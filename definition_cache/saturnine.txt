Medieval alchemists ascribed to the planet Saturn a gloomy and slow character. When people are
called saturnine, it means they are like the planet––gloomy, mean, scowling. Not exactly the
life of the party.

Saturnine is a word you don't hear often nowadays, though you probably know people with saturnine
dispositions. The ultimate saturnine character in literature is Heathcliff––and for
clarification's sake, that would be the brooding, bitter, obsessed hero of Wuthering Heights, not
the lovably pudgy cat of comic-strip fame.
