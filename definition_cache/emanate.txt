When you use the word emanate, you're usually talking about lights, sounds or unseen forces coming
out of a specific source. If you hear creepy sounds emanating from an old house, that might mean
it's haunted.

Emanate derives from the Latin e- 'out' and manare to flow. If that last word looks a little like
manure to you, you might be interested to know that they're not at all related. Thank goodness, too,
because the idea of manure flowing out––or emanating––is not something to be discussed in
polite company.
