You know that wooden hammer a judge slams down on his desk when he's trying to bring order to the
court? That's a gavel.

Judges aren't the only ones who use gavels. They are common in governments large and small, where
they are used to bring order to the often unruly rooms where government happens. But they are also a
sign of who's in charge. The practice of turning control from one party, or one person, to another,
is done by passing the gavel. It's a big deal when the outgoing Speaker of the House of
Representatives turns over the gavel  to the incoming Speaker. Sometimes it looks like the hand-off
won't happen Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; a gavel being the ultimate sign of authority and power.
