Turgid describes something that's swollen, typically by fluids, like a turgid water balloon that's
way too big to resist dropping on your friend's head.

Turgid comes from the Latin word turgidus, meaning swollen, inflated. Turgid can be used in a
figurative sense to describe things that are overblown. That might remind you of some people's egos!
If a famous singer wants to showcase his incredible vocal range and his love of yodeling in a single
song, the result may well be turgid, something so swollen with notes and styles that it seems ready
to burst.
