Do you ever feel like one of a kind? Then maybe you are peerless, a word for someone (or something)
unique, excellent, and superior.

Peerless is a variation of peer Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; a word for folks in the same boat as you, or at
least the same class. A teacher's peers are other teachers, but if she's a much better teacher than
anyone, you could call her a peerless teacher. One of the many compliments given to Michael Jordan
is that he was peerless. Amazing, one-of-a-kind people like Picasso, Gandhi, and Shakespeare are
considered peerless. The rest of us have a lot of peers.
