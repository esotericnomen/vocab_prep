If you are interested in metaphysics and the meaning of existence (and want to impress your
friends,)  ontology may be a good field of study for you.

Ontology comes from two Greek words: on, which means being, and logia, which means study. So
ontology is the study of being alive and existing. Heady stuff, but something we all ponder at one
point or another. When you see the word ontology, think of Hamlet agonizing over To be, or not to be
or Descartes stating I think, therefore I am.
