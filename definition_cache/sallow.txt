Sallow means unhealthy in appearance––often yellow in color––and is almost invariably used
to describe someone's complexion. His smile was as engaging as ever, but from his sallow complexion,
I knew he was sick.

Usually we say that when someone is sick they turn green. You could also say their skin takes on a
sallow look, and you'd mean the same thing. Sallow also describes the way someone looks if they have
lost blood or are pale from fever.
