A speech, presentation, or writing that pays tribute to someone's lifetime achievements can be
described as eulogistic, such as the eulogistic video that was shown at the legendary coach's
retirement party.

Though eulogistic, pronounced you-luh-JIH-stick, comes from the Greek word eulogia, meaning praise;
good or fine language, it most often describes speeches or testimonials made at someone's funeral or
memorial service. Eulogistic words can also be used to honor the living, especially those
celebrating a milestone like a birthday that ends in a zero or retiring after a long and memorable
career.
