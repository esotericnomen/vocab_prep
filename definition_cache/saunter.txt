To saunter is to stroll at a leisurely pace. The next time someone accuses you of dragging your feet
and asks you to speed it up, calmly tell them that you’re perfecting your saunter.

A verb of unconfirmed origin, saunter means to “walk with a leisurely gait.” As a noun, saunter
describes that leisurely gait. Henry David Thoreau once said “it is a great art to saunter.” So
while crossing a busy street may not be the best time to test out your sauntering abilities, feel
free to practice when you're not in a hurry.
