Need to find shelter, from the weather or from other troubles? Then you need a haven.

Haven looks a lot like heaven, and the words have quite a bit in common. A haven isn't necessarily
as wonderful as heaven is supposed to be, but it is a good place to find when you're in trouble or
someone is after you. This word often appears in the phrase safe haven, which is a good reminder of
its meaning. A haven is a safe place, and people who are in trouble tend to seek havens.
