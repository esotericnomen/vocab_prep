A throng is a crowd of people or animals. On the crowded platform, the throng of passengers
attempted to push their way into the already overcrowded subway car.

When used as a noun, throng means a tightly packed crowd of people or animals. As a verb, it means
to push together or squeeze into an area. The science fiction movie fans thronged into the
auditorium when they heard their favorite actor had entered the building. The word comes to us from
the Middle English term meaning push or force one's way, which is exactly what you'd have to do if
you got stuck inside a throng of people.
