The Queen's guards outside Buckingham Palace might seem stodgy (or stuffy and stuck-up), but they
are only doing their job.

Stodgy is an adjective to describe anything dull, out-of-style, or even hard to digest. Just your
luck getting stuck sitting next to stodgy Aunt Irma at Thanksgiving! From the looks of her stodgy
moth-smelling clothes to her stodgy or dull conversation, chances are it will be a long meal. Just
hope the mashed potatoes are light and fluffy.
