The noun dotage describes the mental decline that many elderly people eventually experience. Those
in their dotage sometimes act silly or forgetful.

The first syllable in dotage rhymes with go: DOE-tage. The verb dote means to be silly and also to
be infatuated, both of which can at times describe those in their dotage (including a renewed
interest in romance that many may not have experienced since they were giddy teenagers, in love for
the first time).
