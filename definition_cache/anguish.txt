figurative sense of distressed Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; think of being choked off or forced into a small
space. In modern times anguish has been in the English with the parallel and related meanings of
physical torment and emotional suffering. Both kinds might be experienced at the hands of a dentist
who likes to make his patients squirm in agony.
