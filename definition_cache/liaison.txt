Employ the French-sounding word liaison to refer to a relationship, a link between people or groups
who aids communication.

There are two main definitions for liaison that stem from Old French and before that, the Latin word
for to bind. The first definition refers in general to a connection or a relationship that serves
effective communication. The second definition refers more specifically to an illicit relationship,
or an affair, and can have a negative connotation.
