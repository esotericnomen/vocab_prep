A quirk is a unique, odd, and sometimes charming trait that makes a person stand out from the crowd.
Country comedian Minnie Pearl was known for her quirk of wearing a $1.98 price tag dangling from her
hat.

A quirk can be an adorable little habit, like wearing flowery dresses and big sun bonnets  or bow
ties every day. Someone who has one or many quirks is said to be quirky Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; a little
odd, but usually in a fun way. When it's not being used to describe people's unusual traits, quirk
can mean a quick curve, or a groove, that runs along or separates the molding in a building.
