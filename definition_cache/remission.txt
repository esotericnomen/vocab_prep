Remission refers to a stage of lesser intensity, when something subsides or improves. Remission is
usually a good thing â€” like when your cancer is in remission, it means that it is manageable and
not getting any worse.

Remission comes from the Latin remissionem, meaning relaxation, a sending back. If something
difficult lets up, you'll be able to relax a little. For example, if are being pelted non-stop
during a dodgeball game, you'd hope for a remission, so you have a minute to take a breath and find
your glasses. Another meaning of the noun remission is a payment. Your college tuition remission
must be taken care of before you start classes.
