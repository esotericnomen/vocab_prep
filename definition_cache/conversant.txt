If you know a lot about computer programming, then you could describe yourself as conversant with
the latest updates in coding languages. This means you have current working knowledge of the topic.

The word conversant can be traced back to the Latin word conversari, meaning to “keep company
with.” If you’re conversant with something, then you’re familiar with it — as if you have
been keeping company with it. The word is often paired with the prepositions with, as in being
conversant with the Detroit area, or in, as in if you speak French, you’re conversant in French.
