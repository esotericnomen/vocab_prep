When two things live or happen during the same period of time, they are coeval. If you annotate an
old poem, the annotations and the text of the poem are not coeval.

The word coeval comes from the Latin co- jointly or in common and aevum age. The beginning of Major
League Baseball is coeval with the invention of the telephone. People can be coeval, though more
often you'll hear contemporary used to describe people who are about the same age. You and your
contemporaries probably view the world a lot differently than your grandparents' generation.
