Something is carcinogenic if it has the potential to cause cancer. Cigarettes, for example, are
carcinogenic because studies show that smokers are more likely than non-smokers to develop certain
kinds of cancer.

To correctly pronounce carcinogenic, accent the fourth syllable: car-sih-nuh-JEN-ick. Carcinogenic
is related to the noun carcinogen, meaning a cancer-causing substance. Both words come from
carcinoma, or malignant tumor and -gen, a suffix that means something produced. So something that is
carcinogenic produces malignant tumors Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; cancer.
