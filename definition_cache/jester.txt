A jester is a joker or clown who performs for an audience. Most jesters worked for English kings'
courts during medieval and Tudor times.

Back in Shakespeare's day, English royals employed many entertainers who performed plays, songs, and
other acts for them. Among these professionals was the jester, whose job was keeping the nobles
amused. Some jesters would travel in groups, putting on shows in various cities. Fools and jesters
appear in many of Shakespeare's plays. The word was originally spelled gestour, which was defined as
a minstrel or teller of tales. The root is the Anglo-Latin gesten, recite a tale.
