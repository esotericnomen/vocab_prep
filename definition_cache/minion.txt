Your minions, if you are lucky enough to have any, are those people who are devoted to you and
entirely dependent on you. If you borrow money from a bully and don't pay it back, he might send one
of his minions after you.

A minion is nothing more than a yes-man, a nameless faceless servant. It is a negative term implying
that your only importance is from the person who orders you around. Corporate presidents may have
minions to do their dirty work such as firing employees who have made a mistake. If a celebrity
comes to town, minions will come ahead of time to make sure that everything is to the celebrity's
liking.
