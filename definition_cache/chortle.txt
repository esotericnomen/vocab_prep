A chortle is a joyful, partly muffled laugh. If you have a toddler, you will recognize the sound of
a delighted chortle, sort of louder and a bit more raucous than a giggle.

In 1871, Lewis Carroll, who wrote Alice in Wonderland, coined the word chortle in the poem
Jabberwocky, about a son who slays a monster and comes back to his relieved and happy father: 'O
frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!' He chortled in his joy. Experts consider the word a blend of the
words chuckle and snort and the laugh itself is also a cross between the two. You may chortle in
glee if you find out your work nemesis just got a new job in another office Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; out of
state.
