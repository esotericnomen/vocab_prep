Imitation may be the most sincere form of flattery, but to mock is to make fun of or mimic someone

The verb mock — as in the use that inspired the name of the mockingbird — can be simple
imitation but, more often, to mock someone is to show disdain through mimicry or parody.  As an
adjective, mock indicates a fake or a simulation: The design team made the most fabulous mock Eiffel
Tower for our staging of An American in Paris. His mock gratitude was, at times, unbearable.
