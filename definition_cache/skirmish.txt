A skirmish is a small fight — more a dust-up than a full-out battle — and it can refer to a
physical fight or just a battle of words. It is definitely confrontational, though.

Think of a skirmish as kind of a mini-battle, although a military skirmish can end with casualties.
Still, although such an encounter can be serious, even the very word skirmish sounds slight, like a
stirring of dust in the breeze.  Shakespeare referred to the combative nature of his characters
Beatrice and Benedick, in Much Ado About Nothing, as a kind of merry war betwixt Signior Benedick
and her: they never meet but there's a skirmish of wit between them.
