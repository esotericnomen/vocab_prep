Unsightly is a gentler way of saying ugly. Often something that is described as unsightly sticks out
like a sore thumb in an otherwise attractive environment.

A yard full of weeds and broken-down cars in a well-groomed neighborhood is unsightly. Magazine
advertisements highlight products that promise to remove or hide unsightly blemishes and scars,
restoring your skin to its previous beauty.
