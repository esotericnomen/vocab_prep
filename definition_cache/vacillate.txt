Vacillate means to waver back and forth, unable to decide. You might vacillate between ordering
waffles and pancakes at your favorite diner — it’s hard to pick just one when both are so tasty!

Something that vacillates sways or fluctuates, often quite unsteadily. So use this verb to describe
the staggering motions of a person who has had too much to drink, as well as the opinions of someone
who can’t make up her mind. Synonyms include vibrate, hesitate, and waver. A wise Ethiopian
proverb advises, Do not vacillate or you will be left in between doing something, having something,
and being nothing.”
