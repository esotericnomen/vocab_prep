The horrors of war include depredation — the plundering and ransacking of the defeated and their
homes, the terrible, unrestrained preying on the conquered. The word depredation entails all of the
pain humans inflict upon each other.

The Latin language makes the noun praeda prey into the verb praedārī, which then means to plunder.
As if that wasn't enough — they added the prefix de-, thoroughly, to create a word that says it
all. In 15th-century French, the word became depredation, but the meaning was far from refined,
describing a wholesale pillaging of those who became the prey and continuing the history of man’s
inhumanity to man.
