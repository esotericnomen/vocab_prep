The verb impute can be used to blame someone for doing something bad, give credit for good work, or
just tell it like it is, like when you impute your lateness to my not telling you where to meet me.

When you impute something, you name the cause of something that has happened. For example, you might
impute your ability to sing well to the thousands of dollars your parents spent in voice lessons. In
other words, you name the source. You can also impute a person, like imputing to a teacher your love
of learning Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; he or she helped you become more interested in school and your classes.
