Dainty means tiny, delicate, and lovely, so you could describe a little china tea set as dainty, and
you could also call the tiny cakes on the little plates dainty.

The original meaning of dainty, back in the 1300s, was choice morsel of food, and it's still used
that way to talk about a delicacy or a treat. More often, dainty is used as an adjective to describe
something that's delicate and lovely. It's a compliment, unless it's used sarcastically to mean
someone who acts ridiculously prissy. An example would be to say, Sorry I hurt you when I barely
brushed against you. I didn't realize you were so dainty.
