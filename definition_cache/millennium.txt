A decade means ten years, a century means a hundred, and millennium means a thousand. Think: a
decade of marriage, the new millennium.

In Latin, in the Romance languages, and in the metric system, mille refers to a thousand. A
millimeter is a thousandth of a meter, a milliliter a thousandth of a liter, a millennium is a
thousand years. Think of the number one million as a thousand thousands, and you'll get the idea.
