Toxicology is the field that studies poisons, especially how poisons work and how to treat them. If
you’re writing a true crime story, you should study toxicology to know what happens when the
villain poisons the victim’s tea. Mwah ha ha.

Have you ever seen a label that said toxic? That means that substance will harm you. Toxicology —
which is a branch of pharmacology — has to do with toxic substances (poisons). It comes from the
Greek word for “arrow poison.” Not all poisons come at the end of an arrow, though. If a
toxicology report is done on a dead person, it will reveal if they had any dangerous substances in
them, such as illegal drugs or drain cleaner.
