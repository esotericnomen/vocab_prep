Wrought is an adjective that means molded, shaped, or manufactured. A wrought-iron fence has been
shaped to fit a particular ornamental style.

Wrought is most often used to describe the shaping, altering, molding, and manufacture of various
metals, like iron, steel, aluminum. However, the word is actually related to wreak, which means to
cause damage. So we'll sometimes refer to the destruction wrought by a storm or some mad scientist
like Dr. Frankenstein might lament the monster he has wrought with his hands.
