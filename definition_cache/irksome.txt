If your little brother keeps saying the same phrase over and over again, you might find it irksome
â€” that is, annoying in a tiresome way.

If you are a person who likes to know exactly where words come from, you might find it irksome that
the etymology of irksome's 15th century ancestor irken is unknown. If you complain about this to all
of your friends, they might start to find you irksome also.
