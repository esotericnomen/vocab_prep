Something that is delicate and fragile can be described as frail. Grandma's favorite vase is
probably too frail to use for football practice; some of us have learned that the hard way.

Frail can also used to describe a person's physical condition: When I broke my grandmother's vase,
she yelled in a voice so loud that it was hard to believe it was coming from her small, frail frame.
Another way to use frail is in reference to a person's emotional state. As the poet Sylvia Plath
astutely observed, How frail the human heart must be.
