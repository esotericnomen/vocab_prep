If you forcefully throw or fling something, you hurtle it. In a food fight, you may hurtle chocolate
pudding across the room, but be prepared for someone to launch peas at you in retaliation. Duck!

The verb hurtle also means to move rapidly, often with a rushing sound, and sometimes with seeming
lack of control. If you are driving on wet, slippery roads at night, try not to drive fast and skid
out of control Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; if you do, your car may seem to hurtle through the darkness! By the
way, even though we can't feel it, the earth hurtles through space at approximately 67,000 miles per
hour as it orbits the sun.
