Named for the fourth letter of the Greek alphabet (shaped like a triangle), a delta is a triangular
area where a major river divides into a larger body of water.

The first so-called delta was the Nile Delta, named by the Greek historian Herodotus. What makes a
delta so special? Alluvial deposits are the rich mineral soil that can be found in the delta.
Despite frequent floods, farmers often settle in a delta for this reason. Here's some more fun delta
trivia: the deltoid muscles in your shoulders are named after the fourth letter of the Greek
