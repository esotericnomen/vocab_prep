A longer description will supplant, or supersede, by replacing this brief one.

Most words that include super have something good going on. Supersede is from the 16th-century Latin
for sit on top, and it often means to replace with something better. A version 10 of a computer game
will supersede, version 9, making it more exciting. Unfortunately, a person might be replaced too,
as in the younger running back will supersede the veteran player as he gets older. To supersede is
generally a good thing, but being superseded is not always that great for the replaced person.
