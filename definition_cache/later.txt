Later is a way to talk about time: some time after now. You can go to a movie later tonight.

Later can also mean more recent, as in Which is the later movie, Gone with the Wind or Citizen Kane?
It can mean toward the end: â&euro;&oelig;He made that movie later in his career.â&euro;? It can
also mean after, as in You were later than I thought you'd be! It can also be used in comparison: He
was late; I was later. All these uses are about time, and how time keeps moving on from now to
later.
