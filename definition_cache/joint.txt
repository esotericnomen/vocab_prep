Whether it’s the bones making up a skeleton or the wooden sections on your breakfast table, the
point where two things come together is called a joint.

The noun joint came into English through the French word joindre, meaning “to join.” Use joint
to describe the point where two things connect, or join. A joint on your body allows for movement
— you can look at your finger to see how that works. As an adjective, joint means combined, like a
joint gift to someone that was purchased with money combined from two or more people.
