Disjointed isn’t when you can bend your thumb all the way backwards — that’s double-jointed.
Disjointed means unorganized or disconnected.

Disjointed is an adjective that describes something as disconnected, illogical, or just messed up. A
disjointed argument is an argument that doesn’t make a lot of sense. The same can be said for a
disjointed sentence or a disjointed speech. In a medical sense, disjointed means dislocated, or
“separated at the joint.” When someone gets injured, they may end up with a disjointed shoulder
or a disjointed hip.
