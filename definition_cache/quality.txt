The qualities of something are its distinguishing features, and those can be good or bad. The
qualities you look for when buying a tightrope might include strength and pliability, but you
probably wouldn't want one with a slippery quality.

Quality can also be used as a purely positive term: you're a person of quality, or you've got a
quality operation are entirely complimentary, meaning you and your operation are superior. There's a
joke about how quality control in fast food chains assures that whenever you order a burger in a
restaurant in that chain — whether you’re in Dallas or Des Moines — the quality is always the
same — bad!
