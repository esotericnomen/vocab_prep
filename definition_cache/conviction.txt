A conviction is something certain: a judgment of guilty in court and a strong belief are both
convictions.

In the legal world, when a judge or jury convicts someone of a crime — finding them guilty —
this is called a conviction. Prosecutors try to get convictions, and defense attorneys try to
prevent them. Also, convictions are beliefs — principles. The United States was founded on many
convictions, such as the belief in free speech and separation of church and state. When you have a
conviction, you're certain of something.
