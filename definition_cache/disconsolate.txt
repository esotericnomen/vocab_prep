If you are sad and can't be cheered up, you're disconsolate.  Why are you disconsolate after scoring
a touchdown?  Oh . . . for the other team.

In addition to meaning inconsolable, the adjective disconsolate can also mean dejected.  Most people
would be disconsolate after being laid off from a job, but you're taking it right in stride since
you never wanted to be a manager anyway.  With your frizzy orange hair, clown college will be
perfect fit for you.  Good luck!
