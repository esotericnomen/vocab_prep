Someone who is veracious speaks the truth — like your brutally honest friend who always lets you
know what she thinks about your outfits, your hairstyle, your lasagna recipe, and your taste in
movies.

Think of a veracious person as someone who is like a witness under oath in a court of law, someone
who speaks “the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.” Don’t ask a question of a
veracious friend unless you really want to know the answer. The adjective veracious can be applied
not just to people but also to things that are true or accurate, such as a veracious story or a
veracious statement.
