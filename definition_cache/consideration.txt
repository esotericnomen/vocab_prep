Consideration is kindness and thoughtful regard for others, or an act of thoughtfulness. Treating
others as you would have them treat you (the Golden Rule) is one example of consideration.

The verb consider comes from the Latin for contemplate, and hidden in the word is sid,, the Latin
root for star. Originally it meant to examine something very thoroughly, or carefully, as if you
were staring at the night sky, contemplating its mystery. If you give something consideration, you
think about it carefully, and not too quickly. When you√¢&euro;&trade;re making a tough decision,
you need to give consideration to all possible outcomes before making up your mind.
