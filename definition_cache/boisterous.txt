Boisterous is a word used to describe someone spirited, loud, and slightly out of control â€” like
someone with a spring in their step and a song in their heart singing to strangers on the  street.

Boisterous means loud, clamorous, and unrestrained. Think of children on a playground or a popular
restaurant or a litter of puppies as boisterous. This word, which comes from Middle English, can
also refer to very intense storms. You could call a hurricane boisterous, but you will most likely
hear this word used to describe people.
