Some politicians change the boundaries of their voting districts in order to benefit themselves or
their political party. To manipulate the boundaries like this — often viewed as unfair — is to
gerrymander.

The verb gerrymander first appeared in 1812 when Massachusetts governor Elbridge Gerry redrew
district boundaries, hoping it would help his party in an upcoming senate election. Then somebody
noticed that the new district looked like a salamander, so they combined Gerry and -mander to create
the new word gerrymander. And then a newspaper printed a cartoon with a giant salamander making fun
of Gerry, which is what happens to politicians who don’t behave.
