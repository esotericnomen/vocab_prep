Surly describes behavior nobody wants to be around. Think of the irritable old guy who lives on your
street and always seems to be simmering with some sullen nasty anger, whose every utterance he spits
out with a rude snarl. He's the poster boy for surly.

Surly behavior is always frowned upon, but the word's origins are in the behavior of English
nobility. Surly's roots are in sirly, as in sir, meaning arrogant, haughty and superior. Its current
meaning implies all that and more, none of it appealing. To be rude, snotty, sullen, mean and cranky
can be added to the list. Generally speaking, if you find yourself in a surly mood, avoid your
friends and loved ones.
