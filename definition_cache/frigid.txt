Like the North Pole on the coldest day of winter, frigid is an adjective that means extremely
chilly. It applies to both temperatures and personalities.

Frigid comes to us from the Latin frigidus, meaning “cold, chill, cool” or “indifferent.”
That explains why it's used to describe both arctic weather and someone's particularly unfriendly
demeanor. So the inside of your ice box is certainly frigid, but so is a stern boss who refuses to
smile or say hi when you hop in the same elevator. His glare is so emotionally frosty that it
freezes you in your tracks.
