To cozen is to mislead, defraud, or fool someone through lies. Cozen rhymes with dozen, and if you
say you had two wrong answers on your math test, but you really had a dozen, you might be trying to
cozen your parents.

While not related in roots, the first part of cozen sounds like the slang word cuz. If someone asks
why you lied, you might say Cuz I didn't want you to know the truth. And to cozen is to keep the
truth hidden and deceive or cheat. Using a trick to get something is one way to cozen, and if you
tell a partial truth, there's still a part lie or an attempt to cozen and mislead.
