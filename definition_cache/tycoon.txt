If you are meeting with someone who is considered a tycoon in his industry, keep in mind that he is
very successful and probably accustomed to high-stakes negotiations.

Tycoon is derived from the Japanese word taikun, which means â&euro;&oelig;great lord or
prince.â&euro;? This noun made its way to the West in the mid-19th century and originally referred
to the shogun, or military leader, of Japan. It was also used in reference to Abraham Lincoln to
indicate that he was an important man. Now, tycoons are generally understood to be unusually
successful heads of business or industry.
