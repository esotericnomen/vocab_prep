To skim is to remove something from the surface of a liquid. Some cooks skim the fat off of the top
of their chicken noodle soup, others skim the cream off milk to make skim (or skimmed) milk.

Cream is what you skim off the surface of milk, and if you don't like the whipped version, you might
skim it from your hot chocolate. Another way to use the word skim is to mean read quickly, like when
you skim the newspaper, catching just the headlines as you search for the comics section. Skim has
an Old French root, escumer, remove scum, from escume, scum. The glance through a book meaning came
later, in the late 1700Ã¢&euro;&trade;s.
