The verb convene is a somewhat formal way of saying to bring together for the purpose of a meeting.

Convene is one of those words that lend an air of formality to a situation. We use it in place of
the words call a meeting for such situations as government assemblages, court hearings, and
conferences. Its meaning can be easily seen in its history â&euro;&rdquo; it comes from the Latin
con-, which means together, and the verb venÄŤre, to come. Imagine, if the syllables had just fit
the music, the John Lennon song Come together, might have been called Convene.
