You might think of a waffle as a grid-patterned pancake-like food that's tasty with syrup, and you'd
be right. But the word is also a verb that means to avoid making a definitive decision.

The verb waffle seems to have its origins in the 1690s as the word waff, to yelp, possibly in
imitation of the yelping of dogs. The word soon came to mean to talk foolishly and then eventually
to vacillate, to change. The food term waffle, as part of waffle iron, appeared in 1794, a
descendant of the Dutch word wafel, which comes from the same Germanic source as weave: it's easy to
see the waffle pattern as similar to a woven fabric.
