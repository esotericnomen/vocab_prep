Use prude to describe someone who is too concerned with being proper or modest. It is a derogatory
label affixed most often to girls or women who are not forthcoming romantically––it's not very
nice.

Prude was borrowed from French, short for prude femme wise and good woman, from Old French prud
wise, good plus femme woman. Though the word prude took on a disapproving or negative meaning, Old
French prud also meant capable, brave, and is probably the source of English proud.
