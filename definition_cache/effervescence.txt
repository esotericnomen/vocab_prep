Soda has effervescence. How can you tell? Just look for bubbles. Things that bubble have
effervescence.

Effervescence derives from French. To pronounce it correctly, say eff er VES ence. Originally it
meant the action of boiling up, but it has also come to mean lively, such as the effervescence of
someone who has energy and charisma. It is the opposite of flatness, in which things seem slow,
dead, or just off, like all the air â&euro;&rdquo; or energy â&euro;&rdquo; is gone.
