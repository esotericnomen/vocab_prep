A quisling is a traitor, especially one who collaborates with an enemy occupying force for personal
gain.

The term arose because in World War II, Vidkun Quisling, a Norwegian politician, volunteered to help
the occupying Nazis rule Norway for Germany. Quisling was tried for treason and executed at the end
of the war, and his name became synonymous with traitor and collaborator. The word quisling is not
commonly used in the United States, however, probably because the American term for a traitor is
Benedict Arnold, the name of a Revolutionary War turncoat.
