A canvass is a poll, usually a political one. Around elections, political parties often canvass
particular neighborhoods, looking for votes and trying to measure the pulse of the people.

You might think of canvass as the heavy cotton cloth that is pronounced the same although spelled
with only one s, that is, canvas. Canvas is used to cover things, and a canvass serves the same sort
of purpose. Before elections, politicians want to cover their neighborhoods and districts with
canvasses, campaign workers, flyers and the like in hopes of securing votes.
