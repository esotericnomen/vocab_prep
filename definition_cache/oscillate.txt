On a hot day, you’ll be happy to have a fan that can oscillate, meaning it moves back and forth in
a steady motion.

The verb oscillate can be traced back to the Latin word oscillum, meaning swing, so it makes sense
that oscillate is used to describe an object like a fan or a pendulum that swings from side to side.
The word also can be used to describe a different kind of motion — the wavering of someone who is
going back and forth between conflicting beliefs or actions. If you’ve ever had trouble making up
your mind about something, you probably know what it feels like to oscillate — back and forth from
one decision and to another and then back again. And again. And again.
