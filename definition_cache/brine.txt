Water that contains salt is called brine. You can always tell when you are close to the ocean,
because you can smell the brine and hear the sea gulls.

Brine is also a salty solution used to pickle or preserve foods. If you want to make pickles, you
have to soak cucumbers in brine for several days or even weeks before canning them. As a verb, brine
means to soak in a salty solution. If you live in the southern United States, you might brine
watermelon rind and okra, which may sound strange to someone from Michigan's Upper Peninsula who's
more familiar with brining eggs.
