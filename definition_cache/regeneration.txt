Regeneration involves remaking something. Your city may plan regeneration efforts to spruce up a
riverfront area that has fallen on hard times.

Regeneration means create again, which is what salamanders do when they lose their tails. People
find this regeneration fascinating, but even humans experience regeneration when they produce new
skin cells to heal wounds and burns. Regeneration is also a religious term that means a new birth in
which a person changes from sinner to true believer.
