To confiscate means to take away temporarily for security or legal reasons. It implies an act by an
authority upon one of less power. If you use your cell phone in class, the teacher might confiscate
it for the day.

Confiscate derives from the Latin confiscat, meaning to store in a chest, or give to the treasury.
In school, if the boys begin throwing pencils at each other, the teacher will confiscate them and
store” them in her desk. She’ll return them, however, when the boys need to take the test.
That’s assuming they have not blinded each other beforehand.
