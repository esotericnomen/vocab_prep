That guy over there correctly identifying the dozen spices used in the meal he's eating? He’s
likely a gourmet, someone who knows a lot about fine food.

There are gourmets and then there are foodies. Both are food enthusiasts who live to eat. A gourmet,
pronounced like the French word that is its double: gor-MAY, is more likely to go for the most
refined dining experience, created by a chef who trained in Europe. A foodie, on the other hand,
might take you to the best burrito place — because their guacamole tastes the best — then stop
by the farmers' market to see if the first of the asparagus crop has arrived.
