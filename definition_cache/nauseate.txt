To nauseate one’s friends is to make them disgusted, sick to their stomachs, or ill.  Generally
this is best achieved by serving foul food or sharing someone’s deepest secrets with a sworn
enemy.

The first seafaring cultures were most likely Polynesian, but the Romans (who spoke Latin) came up
with the word for seasickness that stuck: nausea.  When the ocean is too rollicking, it’s likely
to nauseate the ship’s passengers.  There’s plenty more examples out there that can nauseate
even the most hearty among us.  Often just the thought of some culinary oddities can do the trick:
oyster casserole, tripe, or fried crickets — just to name a few.
