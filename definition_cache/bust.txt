If you bust something, you have broken it. A bust can also be a statue of someone from the shoulders
up. Be careful to not bust a bust on your next field trip!

Several meanings of bust are pretty discouraging. You might describe your business as bust if it's
totally out of money, for example. Or you might threaten your younger sister, If you bust my ceramic
unicorn, you're in big trouble! There's also the kind of bust that might sit on your piano, like a
bust of Mozart or Bach Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; a statue of a person's head and upper shoulders. This is the
oldest meaning of the word, from the Italian busto, upper body.
