A gesticulation is a dramatic movement that gets attention. Some stand-up comedians dash across the
stage, throwing their hands around, as they act out what they are talking about. These
gesticulations become part of the act.

You can see the word gesture in gesticulation. When you gesture, you move in a way that communicates
feelings about what you're saying, such as shrugging your shoulders while saying, I don't know.  A
gesticulation is even more emphatic than that Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; a gesture might be a shrug of the
shoulders, but add upturned palms and a comical facial expression that shows confusion and you have
gesticulation.
