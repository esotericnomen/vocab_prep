If it’s fall and the yard is covered with leaves, you'll want to get out the rake, a long-handled
tool with a row of tines. Either that, or get out the excuses and leave the leaves where they lie.

Rake has several senses, including to use a rake to gather leaves or smooth soil. Rake can also mean
to search something — the way police may rake through a crime scene for clues or the way you may
rake through a messy desk to find a pencil. A rake is also a slanted plane — it's often used to
refer to a slanted stage in a theater. In high society, a rake is an immoral man.
