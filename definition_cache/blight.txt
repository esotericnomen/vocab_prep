A blight is a disease that hurts plants and makes their leaves wither. It can also affect
neighborhoods. Urban blight refers to a part of the city where things are falling apart.

Blight rhymes with bright, but it’s the opposite of sunshine; instead of making plants grow, it
cripples them. The Irish Potato Famine was an example of a blight. In 1845, more than a third of the
potato crops were ruined. The plants turned black and their leaves dried up and people who relied on
potatoes for most of their meals also withered and experienced extreme hardship and hunger. You
might want to think of it this way: a blight makes people — or plants — fight for their lives.
