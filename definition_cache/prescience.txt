Do you already know what happens tomorrow? Next week? Next year? If you can see into the future,
then you have prescience.

The word prescience might look like pre + science, but it really comes from the Latin word
praescientia, which means fore-knowledge Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; or knowledge you know before anyone else.
Don't assume it's a crystal ball kind of power that lets someone with prescience see the future.
It's more like a state of mind or level of expertise that allows for excellent foresight and
planning.
