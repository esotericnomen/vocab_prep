Communal and community both come from Latin communis common, of the community—if a pool is
communal, it can be used by the members of the community that owns it.

A communal well in a town without plumbing is a great idea. Until it runs dry, everyone can take
responsibility for caring for their water source. A communal drinking cup is not such a great
idea—accompanied as it is by possible infection.
