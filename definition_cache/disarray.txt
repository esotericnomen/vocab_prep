If something is confused or disorganized, use the noun disarray, like the disarray that follows your
little brother everywhere he goes because he spills everything and never puts away his toys.

Combine the prefix dis-, meaning “lack of,” with array, which derives from the Old French word
areer (to put in order), and... you’ve got a mess on your hands — or a lack of order. That's
disarray. Whether it’s your plans, your kitchen, your workplace, or your hair, the noun disarray
can be used to describe anything that is characterized by disorder, untidiness, or confusion.
