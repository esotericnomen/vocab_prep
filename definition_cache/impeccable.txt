The adjective impeccable describes something or someone without any flaws. A stand-up comedian needs
impeccable timing for his jokes to work.

The adjective impeccable refers to something or someone without marking or error Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; but
it can also mean to be spotless or clean. The word comes from the Latin impeccabilis and means to be
sinless, which is also one of the senses, now outdated, in English. You can see how clean comes from
sinless. Because of the messy nature of picnic food, it is highly unlikely that you would leave with
your clothing still as impeccable as when you arrived, especially if you like mustard and ketchup!
