Even means level and flat. When you're planning to build one of your famously elaborate sandcastles
on the beach, you probably make sure the sand is even before you start.

Something smooth and regular, like a wall that's prepped for painting, is even. Even also describes
a balance like when you give all the kids an even amount of candy, or something that is calm, like a
person who has an even temper. In math, an even number is one that can be divided by two without a
remainder. The adverb even is used to emphasize something, like when your friend doesn't even see
you waving frantically at her.
