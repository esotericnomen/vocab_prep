If you find someone to be unprepossessing, you find them unattractive. Not that they're ugly, mind
you! Just unprepossessing.

Unprepossessing is a rather indirect way of calling someone unattractive, or at best OK-looking.
Unprepossessing is not quite the same as ugly. Rather, just a way of saying that someone's looks
aren't what you're most likely to remember about them. Cinderella was most unprepossessing in the
filthy clothes and worn-out shoes that her step-sisters forced her to wear. But when she was all
decked out by her fairy godmother, she was the belle of the ball: she was no longer unprepossessing.
