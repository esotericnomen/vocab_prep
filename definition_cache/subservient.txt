Subservient means compliant, obedient, submissive, or having the qualities of a servant. Something
that's subservient has been made useful, or put into the service of, something else.

Our word subservient is unusual because it actually comes from the Latin word of exactly the same
spelling and almost the identical meaning Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; subjecting to or complying with. Usually
words change a little in spelling or meaning when they are adopted from another language, but this
one did not. Maybe the word subservient seemed so subservient that it could comply with the rules of
any language!
