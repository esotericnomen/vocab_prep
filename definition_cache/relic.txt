A relic is a fragment from the past — one of Elvis's guitars, an ancient piece of pottery or even
an outmoded way of thinking -– that remains behind. Your dad might love his old albums, but to
you, they're just relics.

The noun relic is derived from relinquere, Latin for to leave behind.  A crumbling Roman wall is a
relic of a once-great civilization. The superstition that seven years of bad luck will follow if you
break a mirror may be a relic of the old superstition that a mirror can trap the souls of those
reflected in it. Whether it's an object or an idea, a relic is a remnant of the past. Religious
relics are items, such as Buddha’s tooth or St. Anne’s wrist bone, that have been preserved and
venerated.
