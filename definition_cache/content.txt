If you feel content, you're satisfied and happy. The content of a book, movie, or song is what it's
about: the topic.

This word has two main meanings. The first has to do with being pleased and satisfied (feeling
content) or making someone else feel happy and at peace with things (contenting them). The other
meaning has to do with subject matter: the content of a history class might be American history. The
content of a math class might be geometry. As long as there's a topic or subject, there's content.
