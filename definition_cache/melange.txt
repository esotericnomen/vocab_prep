Why call it a mixture when it can be a melange?  A tricolor vegetable melange makes even carrots,
peas, and corn sound like gourmet cuisine. A melange is any combination of anything, but the word
always heightens the glamour quotient.

The French have a way of making simple words sound like romantic entreaties of love. Call any random
assortment of things a melange, or as it's sometimes spelled, mélange, and voila, you've given it a
sparkle that plain old words like combination, mixture, and blend just cannot convey. This word —
along with a melange of other attributes, like great bread and pastries, delicious wine, and fine
fashion — are all reasons why we love the French. All that accordion music? Not so much.
