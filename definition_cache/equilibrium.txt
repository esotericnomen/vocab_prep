Equilibrium is a state of balance. If you play sports so much that you don't have time for your
studies, you need to study more and play less, unless sports and studying reach a point of
equilibrium. Or become a professional athlete.

The word equilibrium is commonly used to refer to mental or emotional balance, and a near synonym in
this sense is composure. In chemistry, equilibrium is the condition existing when a chemical
reaction and its reverse reaction occur at equal rates. This noun is from Latin aequil朝brium, from
the prefix aequi- equal plus l朝bra a balance, scale.
