A network is any interconnected system. The Internet is a network of computers all talking to one
another. A subway is a network of interconnected train lines running underneath the city.

A wise man once said that if the atom was the symbol of the 20th century, the network should be the
symbol of the 21st. Increasingly our world relies on networks, the vast interconnected systems of
people, electronics, ideas and even resources. To put pressure on any one part of a network is to
put pressure on all parts, because, by definition, a network is interconnected. Whether the network
is a television network, a cellular network, or a social network Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; each is a vast
system of interconnected parts.
