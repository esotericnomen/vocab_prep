While you might love crows, your father will shudder when he sees them if he superstitiously
believes they're a portent — a sign or warning — of death.

A portent is an omen of something momentous, which can be good, but is more often negative.  You can
use portent to mean a magical foretelling or symbol, but you can also use it to talk about something
real, the way you could describe big, dark storm clouds as a portent of a thunderstorm.
