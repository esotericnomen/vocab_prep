Use the word flair to refer to someone’s knack or natural talent for something. Someone might have
a flair for throwing fantastic parties, or a flair for solving complex math problems.

Something or someone with flair is flashy, catchy and full of energy. But oddly enough, flair meant
odor when it originated in the mid 14th century. It wasn’t until 1925 that the word came to mean a
distinctive talent, elegant style or dashing ability. So maybe think of someone absolutely reeking
of style and panache — but in a good way.
