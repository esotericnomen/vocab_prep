Fidelity is the quality of being faithful or loyal. Dogs are famous for their fidelity.

Fidelity comes from the Latin root fides, which means faith, so fidelity is the state of being
faithful. Marital fidelity is faithfulness to your spouse. If you're a journalist, your reports
should have fidelity to the facts.  Someone without fidelity to a religion or group belief is called
an infidel.
