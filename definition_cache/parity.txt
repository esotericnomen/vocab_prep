Parity refers to equality of an amount or value, and it's used most often to refer to finance.

Par means equality Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; for example, something not up to par is not equal to what it
should be. In a similar vein, parity means equivalence. Farm parity is a system under which farm-
produce prices are supported by the government to give farmers prices equal to a set level, thus
supporting the farmers even if the market prices should fall.
