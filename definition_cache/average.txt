If something is average, it's ordinary and not very special. You might say a movie was average if
you thought it was just okay.

Average can describe what's true most of the time, as in, â&euro;&oelig;The average rainfall in
Seattle is fifty-two inches.â&euro;? It can also be used in a mathematical and more precise way. On
his English tests, Dylan received grades of 92%, 85% and 94%. His average grade was 90%, or the sum
of the test scores divided by the number of tests taken.
