A magistrate is a person who lays down the law â€” a judge or other civil authority who conducts a
court. Minor offenses are often brought before a magistrate.

Magistrate goes back to the Latin magistratus, meaning administrator. Lawmakers and judges might
have a role in making and changing laws; magistrates focus on carrying out the laws on a case-by-
case basis. A magistrate doesn't usually make final rulings on murders or high-level cases. He or
she might hear cases about things like property damage or traffic violations.
