Making a commitment involves dedicating yourself to something, like a person or a cause. Before you
make a commitment, think carefully. A commitment obligates you to do something.

Some commitments are large, like marriage. When you take a job, you're making a commitment to show
up and do the job well, and your employer makes a commitment to pay you. There are smaller
commitments too. If you said you'd meet a friend at six, that's a commitment Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; show up
or your friend will be mad. You also can speak of commitment as a quality. Staying after school for
a study group shows your commitment to good grades.
