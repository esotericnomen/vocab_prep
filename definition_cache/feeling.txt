A physical sensation is a feeling. When you sit on your foot so long that it falls asleep, you'll
first have no feeling in it, and then you'll have a terrible pins and needles feeling.

An intuitive sense about something can also be called a feeling. Your bad feeling about the field
trip is justified when another kid throws up on you while riding the roller coaster. A vague sense
or belief can also be referred to as a feeling. In your town, there is a general feeling that the
library should stay open on Sundays, but you should make up your own mind.
