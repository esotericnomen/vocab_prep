This one's easy. If someone is maniacal then they're behaving like a maniac. Add an -ly to make it
an adverb, and you get maniacally, as in she's acting maniacally.

The noun maniac is almost always used to describe people who do nutty things√¢&euro;&rdquo;serial
killers, insane people on the street, crowds at soccer matches. But the adjective maniacal can be
more loosely applied to situations, settings, animals, etc. You can use maniacal to describe almost
anything that seems wildly crazy or dangerously out of kilter. I don't even remember what the
Beatles played that first time on TV. It's the maniacal screaming from the fans that sticks in my
head. No movie villain was ever as maniacal as Jason, in Friday the 13th.
