The minute you get down on one knee and ask a man to marry you — assuming he says yes — he
becomes your fiancé, or the man you are engaged to marry.

Fiancé comes from French; in fact, it is so French that it even has masculine and feminine versions
(like many nouns in French). If you're talking about a woman, you would call her a fiancée rather
than a fiancé, which is used only to refer to men. The Latin root of fiancé, which is spelled the
same way, means a promise, so you can think of becoming someone's fiance as a promise you're making
to go through with the marriage.
