A saboteur is a person who makes a mess of a situation on purpose.  You might call your little
brother a saboteur for letting the air out of your bicycle tires, but you could be a saboteur in
return by filling his shoes with cold spaghetti.

Saboteur is a noun that is fairly new to the English language; it was first used in the early 1900s,
and it refers to a person who deliberately destroys or obstructs something.  It comes from the
French word, saboter, which really and truly means to kick something with an old-fashioned wooden
shoe.  We can only hope that one day the word Nikeur might enter the English language to mean a
person who kicks something with a sneaker.
