Something is traumatic if it's very upsetting, painful, or disturbing. The word is related to a
Greek word meaning wound, so you can think of traumatic as something involving a wound, either
physical or mental.

Your brother's reckless driving could make getting to school a traumatic experience in terms of your
mental health. Traumatic can also describe a major physical injury, such as a traumatic brain
injury. Post-traumatic stress disorder is a medical term used to describe the lasting and
debilitating effects of something awful you've experienced, such as witnessing a disaster or
suffering a major injury during combat.
