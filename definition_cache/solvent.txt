Solventâ€™s meaning changes pretty drastically depending on its part of speech. As a noun, solvent
is either a certain kind of chemical or an idea that solves a problem. As an adjective, solvent
describes someone who's got cash on hand.

A solvent dissolves other chemicals, which is why it's also easy to remember: solvent is a chemical
used to dissolve other chemicals. The adjective solvent, on the other hand, comes from a French verb
that means loosen. In these tough economic times, only those banks that are solvent are in a
position to loosen the cash flow and start lending money. No cash? You're not solvent.
