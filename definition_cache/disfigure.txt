To disfigure something is to ruin its appearance, which is what would happen if you drew a big bushy
mustache and a pair of antennae on the Mona Lisa.

Unfortunately, disfigured people are almost always portrayed in the media as villains, or victims.
The word does suggest a negative view of someone (after all, it doesn't just mean changing way
something looks but specifically spoiling it). Organizations for disfigured people, however, like
Changing Faces in England, have claimed the word as their own and use it proudly.
