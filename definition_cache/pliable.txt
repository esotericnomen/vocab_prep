Pliable means bendable but not breakable. Wax is pliable, good leather is pliable.  If you describe
a person as pliable, it usually means that he's easily influenced, like a nightclub owner who takes
orders from a crime boss.

When Madame barks Plier! (rhymes with okay) in ballet class, all the students obediently bend their
knees into a graceful semi-crouch. Plier is French for bend and it's the root of the word pliable.
The word pliable itself is quite pliable, an apt description for everything from building materials
to a person's character.
