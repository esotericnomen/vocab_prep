Use the adjective condign to describe a fair and fitting punishment, like the condign clean-up work
assigned to a group of students after they made a big mess.

There are two ways to correctly pronounce condign: CON-dine or con-DINE. The word comes from Latin:
con- means together, altogether and dignus means worthy. So, something that is condign is deserved
or appropriate. It especially applies a punishment that is severe but just, meaning the punishment
is appropriate for the crime.
