Many old buildings located in “ghost towns” in the Old West area of the United States are in a
state of decrepitude. In other words, they are worn out and in disrepair.

Decrepitude is usually a result of old age or neglect. Elderly people can be in this state and so
can things, such as homes and automobiles. Similar words, which also happen to start with the letter
D, are dilapidation and deterioration. Haunted houses featured in the movies are good examples of
decrepitude. Most of them are not new and shiny, but have peeling paint, creaking floorboards, and
lots of cobwebs.
