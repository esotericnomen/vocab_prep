Debauch is an old word that speaks to an older time. It means to destroy the morals of someone. If
you debauch a young girl, you introduce her to immoral activities. A debauch is also an excessive
amount of eating or drinking.

To understand debauch, you have to understand a context in which women were considered pure because
they were virgins and also because they were generally innocent. Menâ&euro;&rdquo;often the kind
whose lives were spent in a debauch of eating, drinking, using bad language, smoking,
etc.â&euro;&rdquo;would debauch these women, ruining them for all time, in a bout of debauchery.
