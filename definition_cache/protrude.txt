Protrude means to stick out. A gravestone protrudes from the ground, a shelf protrudes from a wall,
a lollipop stick protrudes from your mouth.

From the Latin prō- forward, out + trūdere to thrust, protrude often describes coastlines where
rocks stick out into the water. Prō- gives us protrusion something that sticks out, and
protuberance something that grows out of something else––a goiter, for example, or a nose.
