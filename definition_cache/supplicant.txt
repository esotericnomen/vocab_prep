If you pray every night to be accepted to your dream college, you can call yourself a supplicant, or
a person who asks humbly for something.

A supplicant can be a fervently religious person who prays to God for help with a problem, and it
can also be someone who begs earnestly for something he or she wants. A younger brother entreating
his sister to be allowed in her tree house could be described as a supplicant. The Latin root word
is supplicantem, plead humbly.
