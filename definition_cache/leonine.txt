If you are leonine you resemble a lion in either good or bad ways.

Lions are both feared and loved. They are kings of the jungle, agile merciless majestic hunters. If
you have leonine courage, you are as strong and brave as a lion. However, if you have a leonine
mane, that might suggest that you're having a bad hair day.
