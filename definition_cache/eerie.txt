Eerie means spooky, creepy or suggestively supernatural. If it's eerie, it's sure to make the hair
on the back of your neck stand up.

Back in the 1300s when eerie first came on the scene, it meant fearful or timid. It took a good 500
years or so before it morphed into the adjective we know today, which now means causing fear because
of strangeness. And the strangeness is key: Something that's eerie isn't just scary. It's
mysterious, ghostly, and gives you the creeps. Like dark old castles, misty graveyards and creaky
sounds in the middle of the night.
