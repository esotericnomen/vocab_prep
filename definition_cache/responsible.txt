If you're the responsible one, everyone is depending on you to take care of it. And, if things go
poorly, it's all your fault.

Sounds like a drag to be responsible but really it is what we all want out of life. After all, when
you're responsible, you get the keys to the car, you make your own decisions, and you get all the
credit. Parents love the responsible babysitter who doesn't text with her friends and feed the kids
bowls of ice cream. Of course, the boy who is responsible for bringing firecrackers to the football
game will not be looked upon with the same level of respect. Responsibility can bring all the glory,
but all the blame too.
