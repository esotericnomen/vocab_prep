Bounce is a word for an up and down movement or recovery — like a ball's bounce on the pavement or
the stock market's rise after a crash.

Bounce can be a noun or a verb. A basketball player bounces a ball on the floor and it springs back
into her hand.  Trampolines have a lot of bounce in them; that's why they are fun to jump on.  Good
dance music makes you want to bounce up and down.  The phrase “bounce back” describes how you
might recover after a bad situation.  Did you slip and suffer a painful bounce on the floor?  Some
hot chocolate will help you bounce back.
