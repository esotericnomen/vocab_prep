Joking that your dead grandmother never looked better could inject some levity, or frivolity, into
her funeral, but your relatives might find your joke inappropriate to the occasion.

Levity literally means lightness, and it's often an attempt to inject some lightness or humor into
an otherwise somber situation. Telling your Aunt Edna a joke while she recuperates from a skiing
accident could provide the levity needed to brighten her mood. Yet levity is often used to describe
humor that's not appropriate to the occasion, like telling your Aunt the joke, Two corpses walk into
a bar... after her husband has just died.
