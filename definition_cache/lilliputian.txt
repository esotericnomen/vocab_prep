Something that's lilliputian is extremely small, like the lilliputian tables and chairs that might
surprise you when you visit your kindergarten classroom years later.

The word lilliputian comes from Jonathan Swift's 1726 novel, Gulliver's Travels. Lilliput is the
name of a fictional island whose people, the Lilliputians, stand only about six inches high. In
addition to acting as an adjective to describe something that is very small â&euro;&rdquo; like the
lilliputian cups and plates in a child's doll house â&euro;&rdquo; lilliputian can also be a noun
that refers to extremely small people.
