Something depreciates when it loses value. If you bought shares of a company for $10 each a year ago
and now they’re worth $1 each, guess what: they have depreciated.

One of the most frustrating things about buying a car is the way it loses value. As soon as you
drive it off the lot, your new car has already depreciated by several thousand dollars. Though
usually used like this as a financial term, depreciate can also be used as the similar-sounding but
unrelated word deprecate meaning to belittle, lower in esteem. Your teachers should not depreciate
you just because you don't always know the answers to their questions!
