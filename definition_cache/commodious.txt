If your house has a big and comfortable living room, you could say that you have a commodious space
for entertaining. Commodious means roomy.

Yes, you see the word, commode â&euro;&rdquo; i.e. toilet â&euro;&rdquo; in commodious. Both words
once had the meaning of convenience attached to them from their Latin roots. Indoor plumbing is in
fact convenient when you compare it with the alternative as is having room to spare. But that
meaning was left behind years ago.
