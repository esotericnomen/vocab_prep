Someone who is complacent has become overly content — the junk-food-eating couch potato might be
feeling complacent about his health.

The literal meaning of this word's Latin root is very pleased, but even though complacent people may
seem pleased with themselves, we are rarely pleased with them. They are unconcerned by things that
should concern them, and they may neglect their duties. A complacent person might be heard saying,
Ehh, don't worry about it! — when there really is something to worry about.
