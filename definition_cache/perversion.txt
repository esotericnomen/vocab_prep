Although most often used to refer to some sort of psychological corruption or abnormal behavior
(usually sexual), the word perversion can actually refer to anything that is used for a distorted or
wrong purpose.

The Latin word pervertere, which means turn around, serves as the basis for the noun perversion,
suggesting something that is contrary to something else. The word developed a religious meaning in
the 15th century, when it came to be used to refer to any distortion of church doctrine. Around
1700, the word developed a secular meaning, denoting what was considered deviant sexual behavior
Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; often any sexual behavior other than that used to reproduce.
