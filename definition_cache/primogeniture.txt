Primogeniture is when the oldest son inherits all or more of his parents' stuff than any of his
siblings. When a king dies, typically by the rules of primogeniture, his eldest son inherits the
throne.

It may seem vastly unfair, but primogeniture dates back to the Old Testament. Examples of this
practice in which the first-born son receives exclusive inheritance rights can be found throughout
history and around the world Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; from the Middle East to Medieval Europe. Today, perhaps
the most widely known example of primogeniture is the succession of the British throne, which gives
preference to the eldest male child above all others.
