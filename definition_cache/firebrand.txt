When someone is known for being wildly devoted to a cause or idea, they're called a firebrand. A
firebrand enjoys pushing buttons and stirring up passions.

Firebrand isn't such a tough word to remember if you think of that person's brand being fiery.
Someone who enjoys heating up the debate around a subject or lighting a fire under other people is a
firebrand. Fire is their brand. Firebrands come in all shapes and sizes: conservative, liberal,
militant, creative. Anyone who takes a strong, provocative stance and challenges people with heated
rhetoric might be labeled a firebrand. All it takes is guts and a willingness to stir things up.
