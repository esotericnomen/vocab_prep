Dyspeptic is an old-fashioned word not often used anymore. It describes someone who is irritable due
to depression or indigestion.

Nowadays we separate people who are depressed from people who are cranky because of indigestion, but
dyspeptic rolls both these conditions into one ball of fun. A common dyspeptic type would be an old
man shouting Get off my lawn! to kids playing on the street.
