A dose is the amount of medicine you're supposed to take. A bottle of aspirin has the recommended
dose printed on its side.

When your doctor prescribes medication, she tells you what dose you should take, whether it's one
pill twice a day or two teaspoons just before bedtime. You can also get a dose of something else:
having x-rays gives you a small dose of radiation, for example, and watching the news instead of
your favorite cartoon can be said to give you a dose of reality. The Greek root of dose is dosis, a
portion prescribed.
