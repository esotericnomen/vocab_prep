The adjective endocrine describes the glands in your body that secrete hormones into your blood. The
hormones released by your endocrine glands have an effect on almost every function of your body.

Endocrine can refer to the glands in your body — called endocrine glands — and it also can
describe the larger system that includes your glands and your hormones, called the endocrine system.
The endocrine system is responsible for lots of functions, including regulating growth, metabolism,
and even your mood. So the next time you’re in a really good mood, thank your endocrine
secretions.
