Capitulate means to give in to something. The teachers didn't want to have class outside, but the
students begged so hard, she capitulated.

Because capitulate relates to the military, and Romans were all about their military, Latin has a
lot to say about this word. In Latin, caput means head, capitulum little head. Think with this word
how, at the end of a battle, someone bows their head in defeat, and often that is when heads roll.
