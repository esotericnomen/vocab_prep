If your coach yells at your team for sloppy play, his post-game speech might be called a
castigation. A castigation is a harsh verbal reprimand.

No one likes to be on the receiving end of a castigation. The word comes from the Latin castigus
which means to make pure. Try to remember during a castigation that the castigator is, in their own
misguided way, trying to make you a better person. But that may be hard to think of when someone is
bawling you out.
