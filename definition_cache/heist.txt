When a man with a gun walks into a bank and says, Give me all your money, that's a heist or a
robbery at gunpoint.

Heist, pronounced h朝st, is a slang word for an armed robbery.  It's also a slang word used to
describe the act of stealing or breaking into someone's house to steal their stuff. In other words,
it's a burglary. Heist can also act as a verb: If you've heisted a diamond ring, you've stolen it.
