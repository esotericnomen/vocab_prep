Sensual means physically pleasing. It often is used in a sexual context, but is not exclusively
sexual in meaning.

Sensual has to do with the five senses, but it comes with a hint of lewdness, a suggestion of sex.
Although you could have a sensual meal or experience that doesn√¢&euro;&trade;t involve romance, if
you want a word that refers to the five senses without any unsavory connotations, use its cousin
sensuous.
