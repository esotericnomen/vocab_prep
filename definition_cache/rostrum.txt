You've probably listened to speakers who stood behind a raised platform. They set their notes on top
and sometimes possibly gripped the edges for support. That platform is called a rostrum, also known
as a podium or lectern.

The word rostrum, which originally meant animal snout or bird's beak in Latin, has a back-and-forth
history. The word came to be used for the battering beak at a warship√¢&euro;&trade;s bow. The
ancient Romans used the beaks from captured ships to decorate a platform from which orators could
speak. The place where the speeches were delivered was called the rostra, which was the plural of
rostrum. In the mid-17th century, rostrum came to be used for a public-speaking platform. By the
way, the plural of rostrum is still rostra.
