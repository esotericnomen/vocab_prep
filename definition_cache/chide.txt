To chide someone is to ride them or get on their case, without really getting in their face.

People have been nagging since well before the 12th century, when the word chide came along as a new
way to say complain or rail. If you want to remind someone of a flaw they have or an error they keep
repeating, you might chide them with sarcasm, humor, or some seriousness. Where a sharp elbow in the
ribs lets you know Stop it, right now!, a chide is more like a gentle elbow in the belly, saying
Come on, you're late; did you forget your watch again?
