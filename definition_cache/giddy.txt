If you've ever spun in circles until you fell to the ground laughing, you know how it feels to be
giddy. This adjective can mean dizzy, elated, or  — as in the spinning around example –- a
lightheaded, lighthearted combination of the two.

The hackneyed phrase giddy as a schoolgirl calls forth the image of a kid giggling with her friends
over some adolescent foolishness. Giddy has been used to describe someone incapable of serious
thought or easily excited as far back as the sixteenth century. Given that, in modern usage, giddy
describes someone silly and frivolous, it's interesting to know that the Old English source for this
word has a slightly darker tinge: gidig means insane or god-possessed.
