Just when you thought you knew every word in the book for hate, here's a new one: execrate. The word
means to despise or also to curse.

Broken down to its Latin root, the word execrate means the opposite of being sacred or devoted to.
When you execrate something you, are cursing it instead of making it holy. The word is not used all
that often. If you say to someone, I execrate you! they might think you're casting an evil spell on
them. Which in a way, by cursing them, you are.
