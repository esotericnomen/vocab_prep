A neologism is a made-up or new word. Neologisms can be fun-ti-ful, but the problem is making sure
others understand what you mean.

The word neologism was once a neologism itself. It was created by gluing the French prefix neo- onto
the Greek logos or word. People coin neologisms all the time, linguists track which ones stick, and
eventually, we all feel they're old friends. Or maybe not: random samples from words coined in 2003
include: adultolescence, pastability, pre-zactly, and neomaxizoomdweebie.
