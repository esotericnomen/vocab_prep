Pedagogy is another word for education, the profession and science of teaching.

Pedagogy and pedagogue come from the Greek paidos boy, child plus agogos leader. Pedagogy refers to
the teaching profession as well as the science of education, for example as a college subject. This
might be one reason that the word, pedagogue, is often used for a teacher who is overly interested
in rules and details, hence the science of teaching, rather than actually getting through to his or
her students.
