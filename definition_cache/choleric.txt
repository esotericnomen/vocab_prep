Are you easy to tick off? Known to have a short fuse? Then, you could be described as choleric.
Don't worry; it's not a disease related to cholera. Choleric just means you're testy and irritable.

Before the advent of modern medicine, most folks believed that health and disease were the result of
the balance of humors in the body. If you were quick to anger, you were thought to have too much
choler in your system. You were called choleric. W. C. Fields, Richard Nixon, and Ebinezer Scrooge
are just a few people famous for being choleric, easy to tick off.
