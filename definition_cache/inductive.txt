Inductive is a way to describe something that leads to something else, so when applied to reasoning
it just means you collect information and draw conclusions from what you observe.

Logical types may already be familiar with the word inductive as it relates to reasoning. Inductive
reasoning is a way to make sense of things by making specific observations and then drawing broad
conclusions based on those observations. For example, if you break out in hives every time you eat
something with buckwheat flour but youâ&euro;&trade;re fine eating other types of flour, you might
use inductive reasoning to conclude you get hives from the buckwheat flour.
