What do you have in common with your hamster, a whale, a bat, a giraffe, and the kid who packs your
groceries? Every one is a mammal — a hairy, warm-blooded, milk-drinking vertebrate, just like you.

All mammals are part of the scientific class mammalian, which got its name from the mammary glands
used to nourish mammal babies. A note of interest: although a characteristic of mammals is that
babies are born live, there’s a group of mammals called monotremes, like the platypus, that lay
eggs; but whose young’uns, after they hatch, still get fed mama’s milk. Go figure.
