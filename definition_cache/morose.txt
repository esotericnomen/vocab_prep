A morose person is sullen, gloomy, sad, glum, and depressed — not a happy camper.

When someone is morose, they seem to have a cloud of sadness hanging over them. This word is
stronger than just sad — morose implies being extremely gloomy and depressed. We all can be morose
at times, like after the death of a friend or family member. Whether you're morose due to an event
or just because you're feeling blue, you should try skipping or whistling a little tune to perk
things up.
