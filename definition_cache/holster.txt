The noun holster looks like holder and that's exactly what it is. Some holsters hold a single item,
like a gun, and others are more like tool belts, holding many small items.

The o in holster is long, so pronounce it like this: HOLE-ster. Originally, the word described
something very specific Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; a leather case for a pistol. It probably comes from the Old
English word heolster (earlier helustr), which means concealment, hiding place. Today, holsters may
hide what they hold, but they always keep things handy.
