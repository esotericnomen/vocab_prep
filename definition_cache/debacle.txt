Use debacle to refer to a violent disaster or a great failure. If the flower gardens come toppling
down during prom, strangling some students and tripping others, you might call the evening a
debacle.

Debacle is often used to describe a military defeat. If your army retreats, that's one thing. If
your army is outmaneuvered and ends up huddled in a valley, surrounded on all sides by the enemy,
forced to sing 70s sitcom theme songs by their savage captors––that's a debacle. Debacle comes
from French débâcler to clear, from Middle French desbacler, from the prefix des- completely,
utterly plus bacler to block.
