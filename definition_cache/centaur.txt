Have you ever seen a centaur at the zoo? I doubt it! It's a mythological creature that's half-man,
half- horse.

Like elves, trolls, werewolves, zombies, and vampires, the centaur is a mythical creature,
specifically a creature equal parts horse and man. This is a little like a mermaid, who is half-fish
and half-woman. In case you were wondering, the top half is the man part. Even in the made-up world
of mythology, the other way around just wouldn't work.
