To cite something means to do right by whoever said it and give them credit — for instance, if you
add a brilliant statement to a paper but you’re not the one who originally wrote it, you should
cite, or point to, the original author.

Using cite with the meaning to reference or to note is just one of several similar uses. A military
or other official report can cite someone for an outstanding act of service, and a legal
representative can cite individuals, or summon them, to show up in court. To cite a source when
writing or verbally repeating something first spoken by someone else is to give a citation or
notation that gives credit where credit is due.
