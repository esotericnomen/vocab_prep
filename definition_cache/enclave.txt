An enclave is a separate space or group within a larger one. Imagine an enclave as a cave carved out
of a big mountain. All of the bears live in the cave or enclave, while the people live on the
mountainside.

Groups of like people often form an enclave within a country or region. There is probably an enclave
of Africans, Cubans, Russians, or other ethnic group in or near your hometown. It isn't usually
enclosed, but it's a place where people of the same background gather and live together, such as a
Chinatown or a Little Budapest. An enclave of a country may have boundaries, making it clear that
it's a distinct part â&euro;&rdquo; and sometimes under separate government â&euro;&rdquo; from
the larger territory it's within.
