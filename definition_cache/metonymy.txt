When you refer to something by the name of one of its parts, that’s metonymy, like saying “my
wheels” instead of my car.

The noun metonymy, pronounced muh-TAH-nuh-mee, comes from the Greek word metonymia, meaning “a
change of name.” Metonymy is not simply name substitution or metaphor, but a slang use of a part
of the thing to name the whole thing, like giving someone a hand with a project, or “keeping the
roof over your head, by paying the bills for the place you live.
