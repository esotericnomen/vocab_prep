To swoon is to faint, due to lack of blood to the brain. Illness, fear, stress, and even happiness
can cause people to swoon.

Swoon is an old-fashioned way to say pass out: back in the day, ladies in corsets were always
swooning at the slightest stress or smallest nod from a handsome man. Although this word technically
means to faint, today it has more of a positive connotation and isn't used so literally -- people
say they swoon when they encounter something so wonderful it makes them dizzy with joy. Chocolate
cupcakes, the perfect dress, or a stellar home run could make you swoon.
