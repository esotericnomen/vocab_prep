In baseball, the ball is pitched (thrown). Elsewhere, writers, salesmen, and other folks make
pitches (proposals).

There's a long list of pitches, both nouns and verbs. A salesman can give you a sales pitch, when he
tells you all the reasons you should buy what he's selling. A high, short golf shot is a pitch. If
you are singing the right notes to a song then you are on pitch. A rocking boat is pitching. The
only way to know which pitch is meant is to look at the situation and who's using the word.
