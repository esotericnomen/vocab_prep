Dissipate means disperse or fade away — as a bad smell will dissipate (usually) if you wait long
enough.

Dissipate can also mean “spend or use wastefully.” If you win the lottery, you might suddenly
find yourself with a group of new friends encouraging you to dissipate your money (on them). Note
that dissipate can be used with or without an object: Once you dissipate your wealth, your new group
of friends will dissipate without a trace.
