A person, object, or situation that's bizarre is very odd or unusual in appearance, style, or
character. If your teacher walked into class wearing a purple boa, cat's eyes glasses and three inch
heels, you might comment, How bizarre!

Things that are bizarre often involve strange contrasts or unexpected elements. Bizarre was borrowed
from French, from bizarro angry, fierce, strange, from Spanish, bold, like a knight. The Spanish
word was probably influenced by Basque bizar a beard, since beards were taken as signs of energy and
spirit. Nowadays it takes more than a beard to get you labeled as bizarre. Unpredictable behavior is
often called bizarre Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; like when your teacher conducts a lesson in Pig Latin.
