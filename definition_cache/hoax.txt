If you put on big fake feet, stomp through your muddy backyard and tell everyone you saw Bigfoot
fixing a steak on your grill, you are playing a hoax on your friends.

Hoax is believed to be a shortened version of hocus pocus, thus conveying the feeling of trickery
and sleight of hand. April First, also known as April Fools' Day, is a day of hoaxes. Successful
hoaxes in history: Orson Welles' War-of-the-Worlds radio broadcast in 1938 and the alien autopsy
film footage made public in the 1990s. Do you believe the American moon landing in 1969 was a hoax?
You're not alone. Six percent of Americans believe this event was staged.
