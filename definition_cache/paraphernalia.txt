Having lunch in the park might require you to first gather together a lot of picnic paraphernalia,
such as blankets, coolers, Frisbees, and other miscellaneous items that are relevant to that
activity.

This term dates back to the 17th century when it referred specifically to a womanâ&euro;&trade;s
personal belongings, not including her dowry. Now, it can refer to any gear or equipment necessary
for a sport or any undertaking. For example, a hockey playerâ&euro;&trade;s paraphernalia would
include various pieces of protective padding, while a pastry chef has a different set of articles
she needs for her task, such as baking tins and mixers.
