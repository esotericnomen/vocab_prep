Ni hao! Comment allez-vous?  Estoy bien, gracias.  Sayōnara!  If you understood everything you just
read, you’re probably a polyglot — a person who understands multiple languages.

There are thousands of languages spoken in the world, but you don’t need to know them all to be a
polyglot. The –glot comes from the Greek word for “tongue,” and the prefix poly- means “more
than one,” so if you speak two or more languages, you’re technically a polyglot. Well done!
Polyglot can also be used as an adjective, like describing a polyglot neighborhood full of people
from many different cultures or the polyglot crowd at the Olympic games.
