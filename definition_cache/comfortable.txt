The adjective comfortable describes something that makes you feel relaxed, like a comfortable couch
that makes you want to curl up on it and take a nap.

In addition to describing things that feel good, like shoes that don't hurt your feet, comfortable
can mean feeling free from stress or worry. If you are comfortable around people, you can be
yourself. It can also mean secure Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; a family that, though not rich, lives a
comfortable lifestyle, meaning they have considerable savings, or you feeling comfortable speaking
Spanish in Chile, meaning you trust your ability to communicate.
