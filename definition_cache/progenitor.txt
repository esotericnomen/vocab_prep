While any ancestor can be a progenitor, or previous member of a family line, the word is usually
applied to someone who was an originator of or major contributor to the characteristics of that
line.

The word progenitor can be traced to the Latin prōgignere, which means to beget, and so is linked
to the beginning of a genealogical line. The clue comes in the gen part, meaning birth, procreation,
and signifying the genetic contribution of an ancestor to a family line. Prō- means forward, and
the -tor suffix indicates someone doing an action — so a progenitor is someone who gives rise to a
family line.
