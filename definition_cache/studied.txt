Studied describes a result achieved, not spontaneously, but by calculated and deliberate effort. It
will probably take a studied effort to not appear nervous when you give an oral presentation.

Leaders often do not respond immediately to important events. They get a little background
information first so they can give a studied response. When stars have to stand around on the red
carpet before the Oscars to have their pictures taken, their smiles become less spontaneous and more
studied. Even if you walk past a group of girls with studied nonchalance, they still know that you
have noticed them.
