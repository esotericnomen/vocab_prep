An amble is a leisurely, pleasurable walk. Care to take an amble down a pleasant country road
instead of reading the rest of this word description? That would certainly be understandable.

You can use amble as either a noun meaning a stroll or as a verb meaning to walk in a slow,
leisurely way. You might decide to amble, or take an amble, on over to the snack table and grab a
brownie. This word comes from the Latin ambulare, which means to walk about, as in ambulatory.
Weirdly enough, for a long time it was only used for horses or for those on horseback. We use it for
people now, but it still retains some of its horse-like country feel.
