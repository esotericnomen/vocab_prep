One way to think about the verb understate is as the opposite of exaggerate. If you want to make
something seem smaller or less important than it really is, you're likely to understate it.

If you don't want your grandmother to worry about you, you might be tempted to understate, or
downplay, the trouble you've had finding a new job. Business owners might understate their financial
problems when they're applying for a bank loan, and a new student might understate her experience
speaking French so as not to embarrass her inept French teacher.
