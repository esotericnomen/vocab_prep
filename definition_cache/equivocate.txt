When you are unwilling to make a decision and almost intentionally go back and forth between two
choices, you are equivocating. When politicians equivocate, they are often afraid of upsetting, and
thus alienating, voters with their decisions.

A key part of equivocate is the root vocate which come from the Latin vocare or voice. When you give
your voice to two opposing views in order to mislead or keep your options open, you're equivocating.
Think of the expression, to talk out of both sides of your mouth. If you want to go to a party and
your parents keep saying maybe, it depends, tell them to stop equivocating and give you a straight
answer.
