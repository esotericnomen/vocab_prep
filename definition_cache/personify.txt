To personify is to give something lifeless human-like qualities â€” like when Emily Dickinson wrote,
Because I could not stop for Death, He kindly stopped for me...

You can also use the verb personify to show one person embodying another, like an actor attempting
to personify Abraham Lincoln in a play about the former president. A person can also personify a
value or emotion, as when the founder of a charitable organization is said to personify generosity
and selflessness. When you add the suffix -ify (meaning to make) to a noun, you verbify that noun.
So personify means to make into a person.
