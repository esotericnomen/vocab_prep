A melee is a noisy free-for-all or rowdy fight — a no holds barred, battle royal, if you will.
It's what pro wrestlers engage in every night, and shoppers endure at the toy store every holiday
season.

If you think melee sounds like a fancy French way to say crazy bar brawl, you're right: It comes
from the French mêlée which means confused fight or mixture.” What makes a melee different than
any other fight is that element of chaos or confusion — so don't jump into a brewing melee unless
you're really ready to bring the ruckus.
