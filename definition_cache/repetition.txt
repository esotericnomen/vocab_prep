Use the noun repetition to describe something that is repeated over and over, like the repetition of
singing the alphabet song several times a day to help young children learn the letters.

To correctly pronounce repetition, accent the third syllable: re-peh-TIH-shun. Repetition and the
closely related repeat come from the Latin word repetere, meaning do or say again. It can be a very
effective tool in public speaking, such as the repetition of I have a dream that one day . . . in
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s famous speech.
