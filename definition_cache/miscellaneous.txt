Something miscellaneous is made up of an odd bunch of things — things you might not expect to go
together. A breakfast bar, a DVD, and a credit card bill are miscellaneous items that may be in your
backpack.

The word miscellaneous comes from the Latin word miscere, meaning “to mix.” You might have heard
the expression “a mixed bag,” which applies when you don’t quite know what you’re going to
get. That’s true of a bag of miscellaneous objects, too. You might pull out socks and a stick of
butter — two things that don’t seem to go together. Similarly, miscellaneous can describe
something with many variations, like a person who expresses herself in many different ways.
