A nutrient is anything that nourishes a living being. We humans get our nutrients from what we eat,
plants get theirs from the soil. While the best nutrients are natural, we can also get them from
vitamins in a bottle.

The words nutrient and nourish both come from the Latin word n큰tr카re, to feed, nurse, support,
preserve. Although usually used as a noun, the word nutrient started out in 1650 as an adjective
meaning providing nourishment. It's important to your health to get the proper nutrients, so the
food pyramid was developed by nutritionists to show you the balance of foods you need each day.
