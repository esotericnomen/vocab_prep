If two things are akin, then they're similar or related. A cupcake is akin to a cake and relatives
are akin to each other.

If you know the word kin â&euro;&rdquo; a relative â&euro;&rdquo; then you have a clue to the
meaning of akin. People who are related are akin, but the word goes beyond blood relations. Football
is akin to the sport of rugby; baseball is akin to the British sport cricket. Mice are akin to rats,
and rats are akin to gerbils, hamsters, and squirrels. Things that are akin are alike.
