If it's the day before a big event and you have no idea what to wear and nothing in your closet is
going to cut it, you are facing a sartorial dilemma — one that pertains to clothing, fashion or
dressing.

Sartorial comes from the Modern Latin word sartor which means tailor, literally one who patches and
mends. In English the adjectives sartorial and sartorially are used to refer to any matter
pertaining to the consideration of clothing or fashion. The root word sartor has also made its way
into the field of biology. The sartorius — a muscle in the leg and the longest muscle in the human
body — gets its name because it is used when crossing the legs, also known as the “tailor's
position.
