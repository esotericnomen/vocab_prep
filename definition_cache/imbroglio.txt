An imbroglio is a complicated or confusing personal situation. To rephrase the J. Geils band song,
Love Stinks, if you love her and she loves him and he loves somebody else, you've got quite an
imbroglio.

Although an imbroglio is a tangled situation or a messy complicated misunderstanding, its history is
just the opposite, clear as a bell. Imbroglio is just a borrowed word from Italian meaning
entanglement. If something embarrassing happens at a public event, such as a mishap during the
musical performances at the Super Bowl, it is sometimes called an imbroglio.
