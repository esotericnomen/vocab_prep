To have control is to have the power to run something in an orderly way. A skillful teacher
maintains control over students who might otherwise waste time or be disruptive.

A control can also be a device used to operate a machine, like the remote control for a television.
The control in an experiment is the group that gets left alone so scientists can compare before and
after changes in other groups. The verb control means to be in charge. If you're a group's
treasurer, you control its finances. It can also mean hold back. You might need to control your
hyperactive puppy when the mail carrier comes around.
