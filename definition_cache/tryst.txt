A meeting is when people get together for any reason. But when they are sneaking to meet, notably as
secret lovers, it's called a tryst.

The origin of the word tryst comes from Middle English, and originally referred to a designated
hunting station. Today it has come to refer to mainly romantic meetings, often with a secretive feel
to it. (That's appropriate — aren’t we all hunting for love?) The word tryst might also suggest
a hint of danger or intrigue. Perhaps the most romantic tryst in literature was the meeting between
Romeo and Juliet — and just look where they ended up!
