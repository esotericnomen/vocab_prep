If you're flighty, you're flaky and a little bit thoughtless. Flighty people change their minds and
plans at the drop of a hat.

Flighty people are unreliable and irresponsible Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; they often forget appointments, show
up late, and change their minds about important things at the last minute. If you need help with
something important, don't count on a flighty person for help. The original meaning of flighty, in
the 1500's, was swift or speedy. By the late 1700's, it had come to mean fickle or frivolous, and
was often used to describe skittish horses.
