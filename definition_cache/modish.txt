Something modish is fashionable and stylish. It's a-la-mode, or right on top of the latest look. In
the 1970s, it was considered modish to wear bell bottoms.

The word modish is a combination of the French mode meaning fashion and the suffix -ish meaning very
common. When something is modish, it's all the rage. A swanky restaurant where it's hard to get a
table or a boutique selling the newest designer labels are considered modish, or in vogue. Open up
the pages of Vogue and you'll be accosted with the latest modish looks.
