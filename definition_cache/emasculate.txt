When you emasculate something or someone, you take away its strength. Some people believe that
having a tough female boss can emasculate male employees.

The Latin emasculatus literally means to castrate, though it is usually used figuratively, the same
way emasculate is sometimes used to suggest a man isn't very manly. You may have seen bullies hassle
a guy, saying he can't beat up anyone, or hit a curveball, or. . .you get the idea. Such
emasculating is also insulting to women because it suggests strength and female are opposites.
