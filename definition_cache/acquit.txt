To acquit someone is to clear them of charges. Acquitting also has to do with how you carry or
present yourself.

If you're accused of a crime, then the best thing that can happen to you is being acquitted -- that
means you were cleared or exonerated of the charges. A defense lawyer is have his client acquitted.
But watch out for another unrelated meaning: acquitting can mean how you behave, conduct, or carry
yourself. If you acquit yourself like a champion, then you're acting like a champion.
