If you need to be untangled, set free or otherwise released from something or someone, you need to
be extricated.

Extricate is a mixture of the prefix ex, which means out or out of, and the Latin word tricae, which
means hindrances. So to extricate is to get out of what's hindering you. But it's not always so
simple. You just try and extricate yourself from the loving death grip of a grandma who hasn't seen
you in awhile!
