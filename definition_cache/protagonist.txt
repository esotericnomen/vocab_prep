A protagonist is the central character in a story: the protagonist of Huckleberry Finn is — guess
who? — Huckleberry Finn.

A novel, movie, or play might have many main characters, but it can really only have one protagonist
— or maybe two in the case of, say, Romeo and Juliet. That's because protos means first in Greek,
and agonistes means competitor or actor. It can also mean a leading figure in a real-life situation:
Abraham Lincoln and Jefferson Davis were the protagonists of the U.S. Civil War. Don't use it to
mean a supporter of an idea or cause; the word you're looking for in that situation is proponent.
