Onslaught is a military term that refers to an attack against an enemy. It's safe to say that no one
wants to be caught on the receiving end of an onslaught, because there will be lots of danger,
destruction and probably death.

One way to help you remember the brutal meaning of onslaught is through the word's English origin,
slaught, meaning slaughter. But onslaught can be used in non-military ways, too. It can mean a
barrage of written or spoken communication, like an onslaught of emailed birthday wishes. Taken
individually, the birthday wishes are nice but an onslaught is too many, too fast, all at once.
Onslaught can also mean a sudden and severe start of trouble. For example, if your office is
unprepared for the onslaught of flu season, the entire sales force will be home sick at the same
time.
