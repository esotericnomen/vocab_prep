Retribution is the act of taking revenge. If you pull a prank on someone, expect retribution.

Retribution comes from the Latin for giving back what's due, either reward or punishment. But when
we talk about retribution, we only talk about punishment. The old punishment code of an eye for an
eye, a tooth for a tooth, is an example of retribution. Some people think about large events like
tornados or earthquakes as cosmic retribution for human pride. Some synonyms are compensation,
recompense, requital.
