The word agglomeration is quite an agglomeration of letters, a big bunch of them.

Inside of agglomeration you see the word glom which means to become stuck or attached to something.
An agglomeration is a bunch of stuff that has glommed onto each other. Try not to confuse the word
with abomination which is an awful and reprehensible thing. If you had an agglomeration of
abominations, you'd have more than a handful of hateful objects.
