Somatic is a fancy word that just means dealing with the body. You may be tired of hearing your
great-grandfather's somatic complaints, but give him a break - his body has been working for 80
years!

Soma means body in Latin, so somatic means of the body and is most often used in connection with
one's health. You may be more familiar with the related word, psychosomatic, which describes a
physical condition or illness caused by the mind rather than a virus or a sprain. If you don't want
to go to school so much that you begin to feel sick, that is psychosomatic. But sometimes, your
somatic symptoms mean you really do have a cold!
