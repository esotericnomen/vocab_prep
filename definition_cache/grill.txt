Not all grilling involves fire and delicious food.  Sometimes, to grill means to ask a person really
intense questions, like when you suspect them of doing something wrong and you want to make them
confess the truth.

Ever seen a film where a police officer puts a bright light in a criminal’s face and screams,
“Did you do it?”  That’s how you grill someone. You have to be tough on him, and not let him
off the hook too easily. Being grilled means you are in the “hot seat,” and it’ll feel like
you’re cooking from such a close examination.  Better to grill than be grilled, but if you get
caught — think of an alibi, quick!
