The adjective macabre is used to describe things that involve the horror of death or violence. If a
story involves lots of blood and gore, you can call it macabre.

This word first appeared in English in the context of the Dance of Death, recounted in literature as
the figure of Death leading people in a dance to the grave, and translated from the Old French Danse
Macabre. The Macabre part of the phrase is thought to be an alteration of Macabe a Maccabee, an
allusions to the Maccabees, who were a Jewish people who led a revolt against Syria about 166 B.C.
and were martyred in the process.
