High school students who are throwing a dance in the gym might enliven it with balloons and
streamers. In other words, they might try to cheer the room up.

When you enliven something, you make it more lively, colorful, or exciting. Your friend who is the
life of the party can probably be counted on to enliven the dullest gathering, and a sprinkle of
curry powder can enliven a dish of plain roasted vegetables. The original meaning of enliven, from
the seventeenth century, was literally to bring to life, as when a doctor re-starts a patient's
stopped heartbeat.
