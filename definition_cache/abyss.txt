The noun abyss refers to a deep void or chasm — either literal or figurative. Making a momentous
life decision with great uncertainty, like enrolling in clown college, might feel like jumping into
the abyss.

Traditionally, the abyss referred to the bottomless pit of Hell. Now it might refer to either a
literal chasm or a figurative one: Thirty years ago, we peered into this abyss and pulled back just
in time. The word is sometimes used to describe a wide difference between cultures or nations. Abyss
comes from Greek: a- without + byssos, depth, bottom. You may know the related adjective abysmal,
which means appallingly bad — or way down in the depths, as it were.
