Ancient handmade jewelry is often known for its filigree, which is a noun describing delicate
ornamental work made of some type of metal.

Filigree comes from the Latin word for thread. Usually the strands of silver, gold, or wire used for
this type of ornamentation is so fine, it appears almost like thin threads wound together. It
wouldnâ&euro;&trade;t be a bad find to stumble on a chest full of gold filigree-framed items in
your grandmotherâ&euro;&trade;s attic, especially if she wanted you to keep them! The word can also
be used as a verb to describe the act of making filigree.
