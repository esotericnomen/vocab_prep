Rapture is a feeling of emotional ecstasy so magical it's almost as if you've been transported to
some other world.

Coming to us from an old French word meaning carried away, rapture certainly involves getting swept
off to Shangri-La. It's happiness so extreme that you just about float to heaven, complete with big
goofy grin plastered to your face. Traditionally reserved for those feeling spiritual ecstasy,
rapture now extends to anyone feeling overwhelmed my emotion Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; sparked by everything
from a passionate kiss to scoring an awesome dress on sale.
