An entrepreneur is someone who starts a new business. Little stores and huge companies both have
entrepreneurs behind them.

Do you have good ideas for products? Are you OK with the idea of risk? Then maybe you should be an
entrepreneur. This is someone who founds a business, whether a tiny one or a huge one. Besides
starting the business, the entrepreneur takes on the most of the risk by investing their own money
and/or bringing in other investors. For an entrepreneur, their business is their baby.
