When you scuttle, you move with quick anxious steps, like a bug running for cover when a light is
turned on.

Use the word scuttle when you want to describe running or fast walking that’s characterized by
short, hasty steps, like someone or something that tries to hurry — a person who is late for work
scuttling through a crowd of slow-moving pedestrians — but can't. It is also found in these well-
known lines from T.S. Eliot's poem The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock: I should have been a pair of
ragged claws / Scuttling across the floors of silent seas.
