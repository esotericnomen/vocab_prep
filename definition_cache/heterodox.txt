Heterodox is from the Greek root words heteros, meaning the other, and doxa, meaning opinion. The
adjective heterodox was first applied to people who held a different religious opinion from the
standard beliefs and teachings.

Today, although the religious meaning remains, the adjective heterodox can describe someone who
adheres to any atypical beliefs, such as scientists who buck the current thinking or politicians who
do not toe the party line. The word can be a synonym of heretical, which describes someone with
contrary beliefs. If you are a teacher with a heterodox teaching style, you may win over students
but alarm your more traditional colleagues.
