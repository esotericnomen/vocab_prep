In common use, sublime is an adjective meaning awe-inspiringly grand, excellent, or impressive, like
the best chocolate fudge sundae you've ever had.

You might describe a spine-tingling piece of music as a work of sublime beauty. With the, the word
also functions as a noun meaning something that strikes the mind with a sense of grandeur or power:
Never need an American look beyond his own country for the sublime and beautiful of natural scenery,
wrote Washington Irving. The beauty of music or nature can be awe-inspiring, but sublime is also
useful for describing everything from an impressive serve in tennis to a jaw-droppingly good taste
sensation.
