We call a person who truly loves food—food at the highest levels—an epicure. Occasionally, you
might find the word epicure used for a person who loves something else, but an epicure is usually
someone who delights in fine food.

Epicurus was the Greek philosopher whom we credit with thinking the most about cooking and food. So
any time you see the word epicure, remember that that person follows the philosopher Epicurus and
therefore loves food.  Being an epicure ain't cheap. Most fine restaurants these days will charge
you an arm and a leg for a meal good enough to satisfy a real epicure: a good bottle of wine alone
could cost the choosy epicure a couple of Benjamins ($100 bills).
