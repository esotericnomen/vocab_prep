To droop is to limply or loosely hang downward. Have you ever seen the long, floppy ears of a basset
hound hanging down? Those ears are drooping.

When things droop, they're loose and hanging down.  On a day without wind, a flag will droop. If you
are sad or embarrassed, your head might droop a little. Evidently, drooping your head when
you√¢&euro;&trade;re feeling down is something people have been doing for a long time. Droop is also
related to the words drop and drip.
