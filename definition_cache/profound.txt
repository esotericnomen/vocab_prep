When you need a word that's deeper than deep, consider profound.

Profundus meant literally deep in Latin, and profound had the same meaning when it entered English
in the 14th century. But even then, it also meant figuratively deep Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; that is, very
great or intense: The new laws have had a profound impact. Of people, it means very knowledgeable or
insightful, but sometimes if a person tries to sound profound they're really just giving you
superficial knowledge dressed up with big words.
