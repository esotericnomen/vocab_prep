When you rig something, you connect parts in a way that's just so crazy it might work. You could rig
your jeans by using a paper clip to replace a button that pops.

Rig can also describe deceiving people to achieve a certain outcome. Voting multiple times,
purposely miscounting the number of votes a person received, even throwing out certain people's
votes: these are all ways to rig an election. Outraged people say, The election was fixed! This
doesn't mean it was repaired; it means it was rigged Ã¢&euro;&rdquo; fraud played a role in the
outcome.
