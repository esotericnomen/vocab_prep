A sepulcher is a burial vault or tomb, like the one that is featured prominently in the final scenes
of Romeo and Juliet. (Of course, for those who haven’t read the play yet, we’re not suggesting
that anyone dies, necessarily.)

Sepulchers often appear in literature, probably because they instantly convey sadness, spookiness,
and all sorts of other unpleasant emotions. For example, Edgar Allen Poe’s poem “Annabel Lee”
tells the story of the narrator's true love, who now lies “[i]n the sepulcher there by the sea.”
When reading Annabel Lee, Romeo and Juliet, and other similarly depressing works aloud, note that
sepulcher is pronounced with the emphasis on the first syllable.
