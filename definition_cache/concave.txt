Concave describes an inward curve; its opposite, convex, describes a curve that bulges outward. They
are used to describe gentle, subtle curves, like the kinds found in mirrors or lenses.

A valley is a concave curve, a mountain is a convex curve√¢&euro;&rdquo;you can remember this by
thinking that things that vex you tend to stick out, and that caves tend to be holes that go in,
like valleys or innie belly buttons. If you want to describe a bowl, you might say there is a large
blue spot on the center of the concave side.
