If you are feeling lassitude, you're weary and just can't be bothered. Couch potatoes make lassitude
into an art form.

Lassitude might sound like latitude, but the two words don't mean the same thing. Latitude describes
the distance of a particular location from the equator. Lassitude is the weariness you'd experience
after attempting to run a marathon around the equator. Lassitude can also describe a lack of
interest, like deciding you'd rather lie on your couch rather than run that marathon along the
equator.
