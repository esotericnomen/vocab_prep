The proverbial phrase separate the wheat from the chaff may not be terribly meaningful to you —
unless you happen to be a grain farmer. Then, it is good to know that chaff is the husk surrounding
a seed, and that it is generally thrown away.

In cereal crops like rice, barley, oats, and wheat, the seed — the part of the plant that we eat
— is surrounded by a husk. This waste material has been called chaff since the twelfth century at
least, but the word has a long history as a metaphor meaning objects and ideas of little or no
value, as well. The Internet is full of misinformation as well as facts so you might have a hard
time separating the wheat from the chaff. Their nasty comments are just a lot of chaff — don't
even listen to them.
