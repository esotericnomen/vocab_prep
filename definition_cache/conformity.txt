If all your friends wear jeans to school and you wear checkered slacks, you could say you reject
conformity — doing the same thing as everyone else.

Conformity usually refers to people's behavior or looks, but it can also be used to describe
something that matches the form of something else — for example, a one-story house built in
conformity to the low-slung buildings that surround it.  It's common for conformity to follow the
word in.
