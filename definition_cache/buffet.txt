When you see the word buffet, it's hard not to think all-you-can-eat.  Although the noun can refer
to food set out for self-service, buffet also means a blow, especially with the hand, and as a verb
to strike sharply.

The two meanings of buffet come from very different sources. Buffet the self-serve meal is drawn
from the piece of furniture on which such a meal might be served, a bufet sideboard in eighteenth-
century French, and is pronounced buh-FAY. The meaning of hitting, however, comes from the Old
French word bufe a blow or a puff of wind and is spoken BUH-fit.  If the wind buffets the windows of
your house, it can make them rattle in their frames, and if you are buffeted by bad news, you might
shake in your shoes too.
