If your cousin tells revolting jokes, belches, and smells like he spent the winter in a cave, he
could be described as boorish — an adjective used for people with bad manners and a sloppy
appearance.

We almost always use the word boorish for men. This may be because it can be traced back to a 13th
century word for “herdsman.” Herdsmen spent a lot of time alone with their sheep, sleeping in
tents, and cooking over open fires, so it was no wonder that they didn't have the same refined
manners as city folk. If someone offends you by acting boorishly — say, by cutting you off in
traffic — you could exclaim, “What a boor!”  Just don't confuse boor with bore: bad manners
may be offensive, but they're rarely boring.
