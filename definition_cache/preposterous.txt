To a vegetarian, the idea of eating a 52-ounce T-bone steak would seem preposterous — absolutely
absurd.

When the word preposterous was first used, it meant reversing the normal order of things — putting
what was last first, and vice versa. Imagine putting on your underwear over your pants and you'll
see that there's a kind of absurdity in something that's backwards, which is why preposterous came
to mean ridiculous. The word is often used as part of an exclamation: a chef who is asked to cook
with nothing but jelly beans might exclaim, That's preposterous!
