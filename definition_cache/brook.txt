A brook is a small stream, as in burbling brook. It also a stuffy way of saying put up with. The
lord of the manor might say, I will brook no trespassing on my land.

Brook is tailor-made for talking about what you won't stand for√¢&euro;&rdquo;it's always brook
no... If you brook no criticism of your friend, it means you won't let people speak ill of her. If
you brook no brooks, it means you've developed a bizarre stream-hating fetish and will spend the
rest of your days trying to stop their flow.
