Queasy describes a feeling of nervousness, uneasiness, or anxiety. If you're queasy about making a
speech in front of the entire high school, you have a feeling that it won't go well.

Queasy can also mean feeling sick to your stomach. If you eat a sandwich made of turkey that expired
two months ago, you'll likely feel queasy and throw up. If you feel queasy during a flight, both
meanings of the word can apply: you may be queasy — as in anxious — because you're afraid of
flying. And you may also be queasy — as in sick to your stomach — as a result of the air
turbulence.
