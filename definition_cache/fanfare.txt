Fanfare is a loud, proud burst of something to get attention. If you open up a carpet store with one
of those sky-sweeping lights, lots of balloons, and a brass band, you’re doing it with great
fanfare.

Originally fanfare meant a short burst of music played by trumpeters, usually when someone important
entered a room. But these days we describe anything as fanfare that has the same feeling as a burst
of trumpets. If you’re a TV executive with a new show you think is going to be a big hit, roll it
out with  fanfare–—ad campaigns, billboards, celebrity parties!
