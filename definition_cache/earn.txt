When you earn something, you gain it as a result of your actions. You can earn your friend's
gratitude by rescuing her pet kitten from a tree.

Earning has to do with things people get through their own efforts or behavior. A good friend earns
your trust. A dishonest coworker might earn a reputation as a liar. This word is also used in
financial contexts. If someone asks how much you earned last year, they're asking how much money you
made at your job.
