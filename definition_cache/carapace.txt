Carapace is a scientific term for protective shell. Turtles and crabs have them, but humans don't
â€” so we make do with bike helmets and elbow pads.

Otherwise known as outerwear for arthropods and turtles, carapace is a word you probably won't come
across very often, unless you're a zoologist. But that doesn't mean you can't use it to describe
someone who's a tough nut to crack. If a person has a gruff attitude meant to protect them
emotionally, they've certainly enclosed themselves in a carapace of sorts.
