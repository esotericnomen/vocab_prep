A cipher is the numeral zero or someone without influence or importance. Don't vote your popular
classmate to be the student council leader if he or she is actually a cipher, someone who can't do
the job effectively.

Cipher comes from the Arabic sifr meaning nothing or zero and came to Europe as a word along with
the Arabic numeral system. As early codes substituted numerals for letters to hide the
word√¢&euro;&trade;s meaning, codes became known as ciphers. If you crack a cipher, you break the
code enabling you to understand the message. An encoded message is also called a cipher. Send one to
your friend if you don't want anyone to know what you're saying!
