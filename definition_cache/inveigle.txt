When you tell your boyfriend he’s not just the best boyfriend ever but also the world's best
driver, and this makes him offer to drive the whole way on your upcoming road trip, then
congratulations. You know how to inveigle, or use charm to coax someone into doing something.

If you successfully inveigle your sister to doing something for you, she must be so caught up in
your flattering that she is blind to your true intention. In fact, inveigle comes from the Middle
French word aveugler, meaning “delude, make blind,” which can be traced back to the Medieval
Latin word ab oculis, or “lacking eyes.” The people you inveigle don't see what you are really
up to.
