The front is the side that faces outward. If you are in a battle on the eastern front, then you are
in the battle the farthest east of any part of the war.

Front comes from the Latin word for forehead, and it means the side of something facing out, or the
part of something (a body, a weather system, a war), that's advancing into a new territory, or
frontier. A front man is someone used as a cover for questionable activity. Similarly, a front can
be an activity used as a cover for some other, questionable, activity, like a Laundromat that's
really a front for a mafia headquarters.
