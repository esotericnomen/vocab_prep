Perhaps if you are a superhero, you can tackle an insuperable problem — one that is considered
impossible to overcome.

Insuperable is an adjective that is often paired with nouns like difficulty, obstacle, and barrier.
An insuperable difficulty is not just difficult; it’s impossible.  And an insuperable obstacle is
not like a hurdle on a running track that slows you down a little; it stops you entirely. The
opposite of insuperable is, of course, superable, though it’s less commonly used than its negative
counterpart.
