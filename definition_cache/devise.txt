To devise is to figure out a plan. Men twirling long mustaches might devise a plan to tie someone to
the railroad tracks.

To devise a plan is more than just making one; there's a lot of figuring out to do, such as: Phoebe
devised a bus route that picked up kids in alphabetical order. There's a method to the madness of
devising. The chemistry class devised a plan to make the fire alarm go off. Devise can be positive,
too, meaning to find a creative solution: The design team devised a plan to make the trailer home
look like a medieval castle.
