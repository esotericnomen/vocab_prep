If you lounge around in your bathrobe watching TV and ordering out for pizza, you'll get called a
sloth. A sloth is actually a slow-moving, tree-dwelling mammal, but it has become a synonym for
'lazybones.'

Slug also doubles as the name of an animal and a term for someone who is lazy, slow or lethargic.
But with slug, the animal name probably morphed into the human application, whereas sloth has meant
lazy person or laziness for a long time. In the Catholic Church sloth was categorized as one of the
seven deadly sins.
