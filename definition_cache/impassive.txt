Someone who doesn't seem to react â€” who is always taking a pass in the conversation of life can be
described as impassive.

Impassive is tricky, as it sounds it should be the opposite of passive. It's not, though. The fact
is you can be passive and impassive at the same time. When a passive person gets passed over for a
promotion at work, their face might remain impassive upon hearing the news.
