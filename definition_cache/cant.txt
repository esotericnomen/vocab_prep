Cant is language repeated so often and so mechanically that it's essentially empty of meaning. Cant
can also mean the specialized jargon of a particular group — like the cant of piracy (e.g., Ahoy!
Lubber! Arrr!).

Possible sources for cant exist in both Irish Gaelic and Latin, and the meanings of both are
similar: caint is speech, while cantare is to sing. In broader English, the word was first used to
mock the singing of monks (who makes fun of monks?). As it evolved, cant became the whining of
beggars and then the secret language of thieves, and the negative connotations persist in modern
usage. Just think of the clichés and catchphrases parroted by politicians during election season!
