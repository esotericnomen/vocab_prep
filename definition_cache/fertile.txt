The word fertile means able to reproduce, but like so many words, that's just the beginning. The
fact that she gave birth to eight kids was proof that she was fertile; her fertile imagination
explained their unusual names.

The distance between fertile's literal meaning (able to make babies) and its figurative ones
(productive, prolific, full of potential) is small. A child's mind is a fertile place; an idea can
grow there very easily. Rabbits are famously fertile creatures; they can spawn several generations
in a matter of months. And fertile ground can be arable land or a situation that provides the
perfect opportunity. The Latin root, fertilis, means bearing in abundance, fruitful, or productive,
from ferre, to bear.
