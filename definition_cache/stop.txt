You know that red octagonal traffic sign that says STOP? It's telling you to stop moving and to stay
put.

You're familiar with stop as a word meaning quit moving, but the word's original meaning is to plug
up a hole, like when you stop the hole in your bucket with oakum (or napkins). In English, stop came
to mean arrest for any kind of movement. Stop crime! Stop that check! Stop that thief! Stop writing
commands with stop! A stop can also be a place to rest, and the period at the end of this sentence
is a full stop.
