dreary (adj.)

Old English dreorig sad, sorrowful, originally cruel, bloody, blood-stained, from dreor gore, blood,
from (ge)dreosan (past participle droren) fall, decline, fail, from Proto-Germanic *dreuzas
(cognates: Old Norse dreyrigr gory, bloody, and more remotely, German traurig sad, sorrowful), from
PIE root *dhreu- to fall, flow, drip, droop (see drip (v.)).    The word has lost its original sense
of dripping blood. Sense of dismal, gloomy first recorded 1667 in Paradise Lost, but Old English had
a related verb drysmian become gloomy.
