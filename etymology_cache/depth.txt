late 14c., apparently formed in Middle English on model of length, breadth; from Old English deop
deep (see <a href=/index.php?term=deep&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>deep</a>) + <a
href=/index.php?term=-th&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>-th</a> (2). Replaced older
deopnes deepness. Though the English word is relatively recent, the formation is in Proto-Germanic,
*deupitho-, and corresponds to Old Saxon diupitha, Dutch diepte, Old Norse dyp&eth;, Gothic
diupi&thorn;a.
