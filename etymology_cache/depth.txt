depth (n.)

late 14c., apparently formed in Middle English on model of length, breadth; from Old English deop
deep (see deep) + -th (2). Replaced older deopnes deepness. Though the English word is relatively
recent, the formation is in Proto-Germanic, *deupitho-, and corresponds to Old Saxon diupitha, Dutch
diepte, Old Norse dyp&eth;, Gothic diupi&thorn;a.
