injunction (n.)

early 15c., from Late Latin injunctionem (nominative injunctio) a command, noun of action from past
participle stem of Latin injungere impose, literally attach to (see enjoin).


beeswax (n.)

1670s, from genitive of bee + wax. As a jocular alteration of business (usually in an injunction to
someone to mind his own) attested from 1934 in Lower East Side slang as reproduced in Henry Roth's
Call It Sleep.


lechery (n.)

c.1200, from Old French lecherie impertinence, deceit, from lecheor (see lecher).    The priests had
excellent cause to forbid us lechery: this injunction, by reserving to them acquaintance with and
absolution for these private sins, gave them an incredible ascendancy over women, and opened up to
them a career of lubricity whose scope knew no limits. [Marquis de Sade, Philosophy in the Bedroom]


behest (n.)

Old English beh&aelig;s a vow, perhaps from behatan to promise (from be- + hatan command, call; see
cite) and confused with obsolete hest command, which may account for the parasitic -t as well as the
Middle English shift in meaning to command, injunction (late 12c.).


charge (n.)

c.1200, a load, a weight, from Old French charge load, burden; imposition, from chargier to load, to
burden (see charge (v.)). Meaning responsibility, burden is mid-14c. (as in take charge, late 14c.;
in charge, 1510s), which progressed to pecuniary burden, cost, burden of expense (mid-15c.), and
then to price demanded for service or goods (1510s). Legal sense of accusation is late 15c.; earlier
injunction, order (late 14c.). Electrical sense is from 1767. Slang meaning thrill, kick (American
English) is from 1951.
