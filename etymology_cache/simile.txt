late 14c., from Latin simile a like thing; a comparison, likeness, parallel, neuter of similis like
(see <a href=/index.php?term=similar&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>similar</a>). Both
things must be mentioned and the comparison directly stated. To Johnson, A simile, to be perfect,
must both illustrate and ennoble the subject.
