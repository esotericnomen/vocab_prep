arcade (n.)

1731 (as arcado, from 1640s), from Italian arcata arch of a bridge, from arco arc, from Latin arcus
(see arc). Applied to passages formed by a succession of arches, avenues of trees, and ultimately to
any covered avenue, especially one lined with shops (1731) or amusements; hence arcade game (1977).
