1731 (as arcado, from 1640s), from Italian arcata arch of a bridge, from arco arc, from Latin arcus
(see <a href=/index.php?term=arc&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>arc</a>). Applied to
passages formed by a succession of arches, avenues of trees, and ultimately to any covered avenue,
especially one lined with shops (1731) or amusements; hence arcade game (1977).
