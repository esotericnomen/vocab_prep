inkling (n.)

c.1400, apparently from the gerund of Middle English verb inclen utter in an undertone, hint at,
hint (mid-14c.), which is of unknown origin; perhaps related to Old English inca doubt, suspicion.


boo

expression meant to startle, early 15c., boh, A combination of consonant and vowel especially fitted
to produce a loud and startling sound [OED, which compares Latin boare, Greek boaein to cry aloud,
roar, shout.]; as an expression of disapproval, 1801 (n.), 1816 (v.); hence, the verb meaning shower
someone with boos (1893).    Booing was common late 19c. among London theater audiences and at
British political events; In Italy, Parma opera-goers were notorious boo-birds, but the custom seems
to have been little-known in America till c.1910.    To say boo open one's mouth, speak, originally
was to say boo to a goose.    To be able to say Bo! to a goose is to be not quite destitute of
courage, to have an inkling of spirit, and was probably in the first instance used of children. A
little boy who comes across some geese suddenly will find himself hissed at immediately, and a great
demonstration of defiance made by them, but if he can pluck up heart to cry 'bo!' loudly and advance
upon them, they will retire defeated. The word 'bo' is clearly selected for the sake of the
explosiveness of its first letter and the openness and loudness of its vowel. [Walter W. Skeat, Cry
Bo to a Goose, Notes and Queries, 4th series vi Sept. 10, 1870]
