regatta (n.)

1650s, name of a boat race among gondoliers held on the Grand Canal in Venice, from Italian
(Venetian dialect) regatta, literally contention for mastery, from rigattare to compete, haggle,
sell at retail. [Klein's sources, however, suggest a source in Italian riga row, rank, from a
Germanic source and related to English row (v.).] The general meaning of boat race, yacht race is
usually considered to have begun with a race on the Thames by that name June 23, 1775 (see OED), but
there is evidence that it was used as early as 1768.


Henley

leage (settlement) at or by the high wood.
