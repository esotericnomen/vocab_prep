curmudgeon (n.)

1570s, of unknown origin; the suggestion, based on a misreading of a garbled note from Johnson, that
it is from French coeur mechant evil heart is not taken seriously; the first syllable may be cur
dog. Liberman says the word must have been borrowed from Gaelic (and references muigean disagreeable
person), with variant spelling of intensive prefix ker-. Related: Curmudgeonly.
