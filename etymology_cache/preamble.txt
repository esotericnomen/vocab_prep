preamble (n.)

late 14c., from Old French preambule (13c.) and directly from Medieval Latin preambulum, neuter
adjective used as a noun, properly preliminary, from Late Latin praeambulus walking before, from
Latin prae- before (see pre-) + ambulare to walk (see amble (v.)).


prolegomenon (n.)

1650s, learned preamble to a book, from Greek prolegomenon, noun use of neuter passive present
participle of prolegein to say beforehand, from pro- before (see pro-) + legein to speak (see
lecture (n.)) + suffix -menos (as in alumnus). The same sense is in preface (n.). Related:
Prolegomenary; prolegomenous.


machine (n.)

1540s, structure of any kind, from Middle French machine device, contrivance, from Latin machina
machine, engine, military machine; device, trick; instrument (source also of Spanish maquina,
Italian macchina), from Greek makhana, Doric variant of mekhane device, means, related to mekhos
means, expedient, contrivance, from PIE *maghana- that which enables, from root *magh- (1) to be
able, have power (cognates: Old Church Slavonic mogo be able, Old English m&aelig;g I can; see may
(v.)).    Main modern sense of device made of moving parts for applying mechanical power (1670s)
probably grew out of mid-17c. senses of apparatus, appliance and military siege-tower. In late 19c.
slang the word was used for both penis and vagina, one of the few so honored. Political sense is
U.S. slang, first recorded 1876. Machine age is attested by 1851:    The idea of remodelling society
at public meetings is one of the least reasonable which ever entered the mind of an agitator: and
the notion that the relations of the sexes can be re-arranged and finally disposed of by preamble
and resolution, is one of the latest, as it should have been the last, vagary of a machine age. [The
Literary World, Nov. 1, 1851]   Machine for living (in) house translates Le Corbusier's machine
&agrave; habiter (1923).
