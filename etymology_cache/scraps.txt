scrapple (n.)

scrap (n.1)

small piece, late 14c., from Old Norse skrap scraps, trifles, from skrapa to scrape, scratch, cut
(see scrape (v.)). Meaning remains of metal produced after rolling or casting is from 1790. Scrap

scrannel (adj.)

thin, meager, 1630s; any modern use traces to Milton (Lycidas, 124), who may have invented it out of

rubbish. Compare English dialectal and Scottish skran scraps, broken victuals; refuse, in military
slang food.


scrappy (adj.)

consisting of scraps, 1837, from scrap (n.1) + -y (2). Meaning inclined to fight (1895) is from
