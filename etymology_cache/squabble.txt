squabble (n.)

c.1600, probably from a Scandinavian source and of imitative origin (compare dialectal Swedish
skvabbel a quarrel, a dispute, dialectal German schwabbeln to babble, prattle). The verb also is
from c.1600. Related: Squabbled; squabbling.


brawl (v.)

late 14c., braulen to cry out, scold, quarrel, probably related to Dutch brallen to boast, or from
French brailler to shout noisily, frequentative of braire to bray (see bray (v.)). Meaning quarrel,
wrangle, squabble is from early 15c. Related: Brawled; brawling.


nibble (v.)

to bite gently, c.1500, perhaps from Low German nibbeln to nibble, gnaw, related to Middle Low
German nibbelen, Middle Dutch knibbelen to gnaw, source of Dutch knibbelen to cavail, squabble.
Related: Nibbled; nibbling.


rhubarb (n.)

late 14c., from Old French rubarbe, from Medieval Latin rheubarbarum, from Greek rha barbaron
foreign rhubarb, from rha rhubarb, perhaps ultimately from a source akin to Persian rewend rhubarb
(associated in Greek with Rha, ancient Scythian name of the River Volga) + barbaron, neuter of
barbaros foreign (see barbarian). Grown in China and Tibet, it was imported into ancient Europe by
way of Russia.    Spelling altered in Medieval Latin by association with rheum. European native
species so called from 1640s. Baseball slang meaning loud squabble on the field is from 1938, of
unknown origin, said to have been first used by broadcaster Garry Schumacher. Perhaps connected with
use of rhubarb as a word repeated by stage actors to give the impression of hubbub or conversation
(attested from 1934).
