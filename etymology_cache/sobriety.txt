mid-14c., self-restraint, moderation, from Anglo-French temperaunce (mid-13c.), from Latin
temperantia moderation, sobriety, discretion, self-control, from temperans, present participle of
temperare to moderate (see temper (v.)). Latin temperantia was used by Cicero to translate Greek
sophrosyne moderation. In English, temperance was used to render Latin continentia or abstinentia,
specifically in reference to drinking alcohol and eating; hence by early 1800s it had come to mean
abstinence from alcoholic drink.

c.1300, from Old French desguiser (11c.) disguise, change one's appearance, from des- away, off (see
dis-) + guise style, appearance (see guise). Originally primarily to put out of one's usual manner
(of dress, etc.). Oldest sense preserved in phrase disguised with liquor (1560s).It is most absurdly
said, in popular language, of any man, that he is disguised in liquor; for, on the contrary, most
men are disguised by sobriety. [Thomas de Quincy, Confessions of an English Opium-Eater, 1856]
