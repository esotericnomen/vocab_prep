nudge (n.2)

a slight push, 1836, from nudge (v.).


nudge (n.1)

complainer, nagger, 1960s, from Yiddish, from Slavic words meaning fret, ache, realted to the root
of nudnik (q.v.).


nudge (v.)

to push slightly with the elbow, 1670s, perhaps from Scandinavian (compare Norwegian nugge, nyggje
to jostle, rub; Icelandic nugga to rub, massage). Related: Nudged; nudging.


shtup (v.)

annoy, 1952; have sexual intercourse with, 1967; from Yiddish, literally push, shove, related to
dialectal German stupfen to nudge, jog.


nerf

1955, in nerf bars, hot-rodder slang for custom bumpers; from slang verb in auto racing (1953)
meaning to nudge something with a bumper in passing and knock it off course; ultimate origin and
signification unknown.    As a trademark name for toys made of foam-like material for indoor play,
introduced 1970 (Nerf ball). By 1995 this had yielded a verbal sense of to make less effective (as a
Nerf basketball is softer and lighter than the real thing).


poke (v.)

to push, prod, thrust, especially with something pointed, c. 1300, puken to poke, nudge, of
uncertain origin, perhaps from or related to Middle Dutch poken to poke (Dutch beuken), or Middle
Low German poken to stick with a knife (compare German pochen to knock, rap), both from Proto-
Germanic root *puk-, perhaps imitative. Related: Poked; poking. To poke fun tease first attested
1840; to poke around search is from 1809. To poke along advance lazily; walk at a leisurely pace is
from 1833.


nuts (adj.)

crazy, 1846, from earlier be nutts upon be very fond of (1785), which is possibly from nuts (plural
noun) any source of pleasure (1610s), from nut (q.v.). Sense influenced probably by metaphoric
application of nut to head (1846, as in to be off one's nut be insane, 1860). Nuts as a derisive
retort is attested from 1931.    Connection with the slang testicle sense has tended to nudge it
toward taboo. On the N.B.C. network, it is forbidden to call any character a nut; you have to call
him a screwball. [New Yorker, Dec. 23, 1950] Please eliminate the expression 'nuts to you' from
Egbert's speech. [Request from the Hays Office regarding the script of The Bank Dick, 1940] This
desire for avoidance accounts for the euphemism nerts (c. 1925).
