DNA (n.)

1944, abbreviation of deoxyribonucleic acid (1931).


echidna (n.)

Australian egg-laying hedgehog-like mammal, 1847, usually explained as from Greek ekhidna snake,
viper, from ekhis snake, from PIE *angwhi- snake, eel (cognates: Norwegian igle, Old High German
egala, German Egel leech, Latin anguis serpent, snake).    But this sense is difficult to reconcile
with this animal (unless it is a reference to the ant-eating tongue), and the name seems more
properly to belong to Latin echinus, Greek ekhinos sea-urchin, originally hedgehog (in Greek also
sharp points), which Watkins explains as snake-eater, from ekhis snake.


Edna

fem. proper name, from Greek, from Hebrew ednah delight (see Eden). Related to Arabic ghadan luxury.
Among the top 20 names for girls born in the U.S. every year from 1889 to 1917.


kidnap (v.)

1680s, compound of kid (n.) child and nap snatch away, variant of nab; originally steal children to
provide servants and laborers in the American colonies. Related: Kidnapped; kidnapping.


kidnapper (n.)

1670s; see kidnap (though this word is attested a few years earlier).


ordnance (n.)

cannon, artillery, 1540s, a clipped form of ordinance (q.v.) which was attested from late 14c. in
the sense of military materials, provisions of war; a sense now obsolete but which led to those of
engines for discharging missiles (early 15c.) and branch of the military concerned with stores and
materials (late 15c.). The shorter word was established in these distinct senses by 17c. Ordnance
survey (1833), official survey of Great Britain and Ireland, was undertaken by the government under
the direction of the Master-General of the Ordnance (a natural choice, because gunners have to be
skilled at surveying ranges and distances).
