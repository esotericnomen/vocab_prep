talon (n.)

c.1400, talounz claws of a bird or beast, probably originally from Old French talon heel or hinder
part of the foot of a beast, or of a man, or of a shoe; foot-step (12c.), from Medieval Latin
talonem heel, from Latin talus ankle (see talus (n.1)). The extension to birds of prey, and
subsequent stages, are peculiar to English [OED].
