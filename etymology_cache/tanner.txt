tanner (n.2)

sixpence, slang word first recorded 1811, of unknown origin. J.C. Hotten, lexicographer of Victorian
slang, thinks it may be from tanner and skin, rhyming slang for thin, presumably in reference to the
smallness of the coin. Not to be confused with tenner, slang for ten-pound note, which dates from
1861.
