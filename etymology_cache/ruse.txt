diversion, switch in flight; trick, jest (14c.), back-formed noun from reuser to dodge, repel,
retreat; deceive, cheat, from Latin recusare deny, reject, oppose, from re-, intensive prefix (see
<a href=/index.php?term=re-&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>re-</a>), + causari plead as
a reason, object, allege, from causa reason, cause (see <a
href=/index.php?term=cause&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>cause</a> (n.)). It also has
been proposed that the French word may be from Latin rursus backwards, or a Vulgar Latin form of
refusare. Johnson calls it, A French word neither elegant nor necessary. The verb ruse was used in
Middle English.
