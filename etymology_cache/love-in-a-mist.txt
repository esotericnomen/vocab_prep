cunt (n.)

female intercrural foramen, or, as some 18c. writers refer to it, the monosyllable, Middle English
cunte female genitalia, by early 14c. (in Hendyng's Proverbs -- &#658;eve &#254;i cunte to
cunni[n]g, And crave affetir wedding), akin to Old Norse kunta, Old Frisian, Middle Dutch, and
Middle Low German kunte, from Proto-Germanic *kunton, of uncertain origin. Some suggest a link with
Latin cuneus wedge, others to PIE root *geu- hollow place, still others to PIE *gwen-, root of queen
and Greek gyne woman.    The form is similar to Latin cunnus female pudenda (also, vulgarly, a
woman), which is likewise of disputed origin, perhaps literally gash, slit, from PIE *sker- (1) to
cut, or literally sheath, from PIE *kut-no-, from root *(s)keu- to conceal, hide.  <blockquote> Hec
vulva: a cunt. Hic cunnus: idem est. [from Londesborough Illustrated Nominale, c.1500, in Anglo-
Saxon and Old English Vocabularies, eds. Wright and W&#252;lcker, vol. 1, 1884]  </blockquote>
First known reference in English apparently is in a compound, Oxford street name Gropecuntlane cited
from c.1230 (and attested through late 14c.) in Place-Names of Oxfordshire (Gelling &amp; Stenton,
1953), presumably a haunt of prostitutes. Used in medical writing c.1400, but avoided in public
speech since 15c.; considered obscene since 17c.    in Middle English also conte, counte, and
sometimes queinte, queynte (for this, see q). Chaucer used quaint and queynte in Canterbury Tales
(late 14c.), and Andrew Marvell might be punning on quaint in To His Coy Mistress (1650).
<blockquote>  What eyleth yow to grucche thus and grone? Is it for ye wolde haue my queynte allone?

slang and literature before launching into another 5 pages of them in French, German, Italian,
Spanish, and Portuguese. [A sampling: Botany Bay, chum, coffee-shop, cookie, End of the Sentimental
Journey, fancy bit, Fumbler's Hall, funniment, goatmilker, heaven, hell, Itching Jenny, jelly-bag,
Low Countries, nature's tufted treasure, parenthesis, penwiper, prick-skinner, seminary, tickle-
toby, undeniable, wonderful lamp, and aphrodisaical tennis court. Dutch cognate de kont means a
bottom, an arse, but Dutch also has attractive poetic slang ways of expressing this part, such as
liefdesgrot, literally cave of love, and vleesroos rose of flesh.     Alternative form cunny is
attested from c.1720 but is certainly much earlier and forced a change in the pronunciation of coney
(q.v.), but it was good for a pun while coney was still the common word for rabbit: A pox upon your
Christian cockatrices! They cry, like poulterers' wives, 'No money, no coney.'  [Philip Massinger:
The Virgin-Martyr, Act I, Scene 1, 1622]
