turmoil (n.)

1520s, of uncertain origin, perhaps an alteration of Middle French tremouille mill hopper, in
reference to the hopper's constant motion to and fro, from Latin trimodia vessel containing three
modii, from modius, a Roman dry measure, related to modus measure. Attested earlier in English as a
verb (1510s), though this now is obsolete.
