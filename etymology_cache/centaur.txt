small plant with red flowers (now usually erythraea Centaureum), late 14c., from Medieval Latin
centaurea, from Latin centaureum, from Greek kentaureion, from kentauros centaur (see <a
href=/index.php?term=centaur&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>centaur</a>), so called
according to Pliny because the plant's medicinal properties were discovered by Chiron the centaur.
<br /><br />  German Tausendg&uuml;ldenkraut is based on a mistranslation of the Latin word, as if
from centum + aurum (the similarity might be the result of Roman folk etymology).
