centaury (n.)

small plant with red flowers (now usually erythraea Centaureum), late 14c., from Medieval Latin
centaurea, from Latin centaureum, from Greek kentaureion, from kentauros centaur (see centaur), so
called according to Pliny because the plant's medicinal properties were discovered by Chiron the
centaur.    German Tausendg&uuml;ldenkraut is based on a mistranslation of the Latin word, as if
from centum + aurum (the similarity might be the result of Roman folk etymology).
