class=crossreference>little</a> (v.); first recorded in writings of Thomas Jefferson (and probably
coined by him), who was roundly execrated for it in England:<blockquote>Belittle! What an
expression! It may be an elegant one in Virginia, and even perfectly intelligible; but for our part,
all we can do is to guess at its meaning. For shame, Mr. Jefferson! [European Magazine and London
Review, 1787, reporting on Notes on the State of Virginia; to guess was considered another barbarous
Yankeeism.]</blockquote>Jefferson used it to characterize Buffon's view that American life was
stunted by nature, which he was refuting. The figurative sense of depreciate, scorn as worthless (as
the reviewers did to this word) is from 1797. Related: Belittled; belittling.
