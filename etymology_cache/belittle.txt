belittle (v.)

1781, to make small, from be- + little (v.); first recorded in writings of Thomas Jefferson (and
probably coined by him), who was roundly execrated for it in England:Belittle! What an expression!
It may be an elegant one in Virginia, and even perfectly intelligible; but for our part, all we can
do is to guess at its meaning. For shame, Mr. Jefferson! [European Magazine and London Review, 1787,
reporting on Notes on the State of Virginia; to guess was considered another barbarous
Yankeeism.]Jefferson used it to characterize Buffon's view that American life was stunted by nature,
which he was refuting. The figurative sense of depreciate, scorn as worthless (as the reviewers did
to this word) is from 1797. Related: Belittled; belittling.


disparage (v.)

early 14c., degrade socially, from Old French desparagier (Modern French d&eacute;parager) reduce in
rank, degrade, devalue, depreciate, originally to marry unequally, and thus by extension the
disgrace or dishonor involved in this, from des- away (see dis-) + parage rank, lineage (see peer
(n.)). Sense of belittle first recorded 1530s. Related: Disparaged; disparaging; disparagingly.
