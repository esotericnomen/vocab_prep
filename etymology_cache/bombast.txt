bombastic (adj.)

1704, inflated, from bombast + -ic. Meaning given to bombastic language is from 1727.


bombast (n.)

1560s, cotton padding, corrupted from earlier bombace (1550s), from Old French bombace cotton,
cotton wadding, from Late Latin bombacem, accusative of bombax cotton, 'linteorum aut aliae quaevis
quisquiliae,'  a corruption and transferred use of Latin bombyx silk, from Greek bombyx silk,
silkworm (which also came to mean cotton in Medieval Greek), from some oriental word, perhaps
related to Iranian pambak (modern panba) or Armenian bambok, perhaps ultimately from a PIE root
meaning to twist, wind. From stuffing and padding for clothes or upholstery, meaning extended to
pompous, empty speech (1580s).    Also from the same source are Swedish bomull, Danish bomuld
cotton, and, via Turkish forms, Modern Greek mpampaki, Rumanian bumbac, Serbo-Croatian pamuk. German
baumwolle cotton is probably from the Latin word but altered by folk-etymology to look like tree
wool. Polish bawe&#322;na, Lithuanian bovelna are partial translations from German.


rant (n.)

boisterous, empty declamation; fierce or high-sounding language without much meaning or dignity of
thought; bombast; a ranting speech, 1640s, from rant (v.).


bamboozle (v.)

1703, originally a slang or cant word, perhaps Scottish from bombaze perplex, related to bombast, or
French embabouiner to make a fool (literally 'baboon') of. Related: Bamboozled; bamboozling. As a
noun from 1703.


bombazine (n.)

(also bombasine, bambazine), 1550s, from French bombasin (14c.) cotton cloth, from Medieval Latin
bombacinium silk texture, from Late Latin bombycinium, neuter of bombycinius silken, from bombyx
silk, silkworm, from Greek bombyx. The post-classical transfer of the word from silk to cotton may
reflect the perceived silk-like nature of the fabric, or a waning of familiarity with genuine silk
in the European Dark Ages, but compare bombast.
