small piece, c.1200; related Old English bite act of biting, and bita piece bitten off, probably are
the source of the modern words meaning boring-piece of a drill (1590s), mouthpiece of a horse's
bridle (mid-14c.), and a piece bitten off, morsel (c.1000). All from Proto-Germanic *biton
(cognates: Old Saxon biti, Old Norse bit, Old Frisian bite, Middle Dutch bete, Old High German bizzo
biting, German Bissen a bite, morsel), from PIE root *bheid- to split (see <a
href=/index.php?term=fissure&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>fissure</a>).  <br /><br />
Meaning small piece, fragment is from c.1600. Sense of short space of time is 1650s. Theatrical bit
part is from 1909. Money sense in two bits, etc. is originally from Southern U.S. and West Indies,
in reference to silver wedges cut or stamped from Spanish dollars (later Mexican reals); transferred
to eighth of a dollar.
