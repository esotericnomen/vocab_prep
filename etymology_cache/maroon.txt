very dark reddish-brown color, 1791, from French couleur marron, the color of a marron chestnut, the
large sweet chestnut of southern Europe (maroon in that sense was used in English from 1590s), from
dialect of Lyons, ultimately from a word in a pre-Roman language, perhaps Ligurian; or from Greek
maraon sweet chestnut.
