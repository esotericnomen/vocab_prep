spelling of cauldron prefered by other dictionary editors.


chowder (n.)

1751, American English, apparently named for the pot it was cooked in: French chaudi&egrave;re a pot
(12c.), from Late Latin caldaria (see caldron). The word and the practice introduced in Newfoundland
by Breton fishermen, and spreading thence to New England.    CHOWDER. A favorite dish in New
England, made of fish, pork, onions, and biscuit stewed together. Cider and champagne are sometimes
added. Pic-nic parties to the sea-shore generally have a dish of chowder, prepared by themselves in
some grove near the beach, from fish caught at the same time. [John Russell Bartlett, Dictionary of
Americanisms, 1859]    The derogatory chowderhead (1819) is a corruption of cholter-head (16c.),
from jolthead, of unknown origin.
