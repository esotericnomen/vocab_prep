1620s, from French accolade (16c.), from Proven&ccedil;al acolada or Italian accollata, ultimately
from noun use of a fem. past participle from Vulgar Latin *accollare to embrace around the neck,
from Latin ad- to (see <a href=/index.php?term=ad-&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>ad-</a>) + collum neck (see <a
href=/index.php?term=collar&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>collar</a> (n.)).  <br /><br
/>  The original sense is of an embrace about the neck or the tapping of a sword on the shoulders to
confer knighthood. Extended meaning praise, award is from 1852. Also see <a
href=/index.php?term=-ade&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>-ade</a>. Earlier was accoll
(mid-14c.), from Old French acolee an embrace, kiss, especially that given to a new-made knight,
from verb acoler. The French noun in the 16c. was transformed to accolade, with the foreign suffix.
