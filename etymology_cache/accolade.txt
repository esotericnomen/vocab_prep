accolade (n.)

1620s, from French accolade (16c.), from Proven&ccedil;al acolada or Italian accollata, ultimately
from noun use of a fem. past participle from Vulgar Latin *accollare to embrace around the neck,
from Latin ad- to (see ad-) + collum neck (see collar (n.)).    The original sense is of an embrace
about the neck or the tapping of a sword on the shoulders to confer knighthood. Extended meaning
praise, award is from 1852. Also see -ade. Earlier was accoll (mid-14c.), from Old French acolee an
embrace, kiss, especially that given to a new-made knight, from verb acoler. The French noun in the
16c. was transformed to accolade, with the foreign suffix.
