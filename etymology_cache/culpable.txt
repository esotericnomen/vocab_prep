culpable (adj.)

late 13c., coupable, from Old French coupable (12c., Modern French coupable), from Latin culpabilis
worthy of blame, from culpare to blame, from culpa crime, fault, blame, guilt, error. English (and
for a time French) restored the first Latin -l- in later Middle Ages.


culprit (n.)

1670s, from Anglo-French cul prit, contraction of Culpable: prest (d'averrer nostre bille) guilty,
ready (to prove our case), words used by prosecutor in opening a trial. It seems the abbreviation
cul. prit was mistaken in English for an address to the defendant.


culpability (n.)

1670s, from Late Latin culpabilitas guilt, culpability, from Latin culpabilis (see culpable).


inculpate (v.)

1799, to accuse, bring charges against, from Medieval Latin inculpatus, past participle of inculpare
to reproach, blame, censure, from Latin in- in (see in- (2)) + culpare to blame, from culpa fault.
But inculpable (late 15c.) means not culpable, free from blame, from Latin in- not (see in- (1)) +
culpare.
