quay (n.)

1690s, variant of Middle English key, keye, caye wharf (c.1300; mid-13c. in place names), from Old
North French cai (Old French chai, 12c., Modern French quai) sand bank, from Gaulish caium (5c.),
from Old Celtic *kagio- to encompass, enclose (cognates: Welsh cae fence, hedge, Cornish ke hedge),
from PIE *kagh- to catch, seize; wickerwork, fence (see hedge (n.)). Spelling altered in English by
influence of French quai.
