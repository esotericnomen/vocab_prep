com-), + cedere to go, grant, give way (see cede). Related: Conceded; conceding.


concession (n.)

mid-15c., from Old French concession (14c.) or directly from Latin concessionem (nominative
concessio) an allowing, conceding, noun of action from past participle stem of concedere (see
concede). Meaning right or privilege granted by government is from 1650s. Refreshment stand sense is
from 1910.


admit (v.)

late 14c., let in, from Latin admittere to allow to enter, let in, let come, give access, from ad-
to (see ad-) + mittere let go, send (see mission). Sense of to concede as valid or true is first
recorded early 15c. Related: Admitted; Admitting.


allow (v.)

early 14c., allouen, to commend, praise; approve of, be pleased with; appreciate the value of; also,
take into account or give credit for, also, in law and philosophy, recognize, admit as valid (a
privilege, an excuse, a statement, etc.). From late 14c. as sanction or permit; condone; in business
use from early 15c.    The Middle English word is from Anglo-French alouer, Old French aloer,
alloiier (13c.) allot, apportion, bestow, assign, from Latin allocare (see allocate). This word in
Old French was confused and ultimately merged with aloer; alloer to praise, commend, from Latin
allaudare, adlaudare, compound of ad- to (see ad-) + laudare to praise (see laud). From the first
word came the sense preserved in allowance as money granted; from the second came its meaning
permission based on approval.    Between the two primary significations there naturally arose a
variety of uses blending them in the general idea of assign with approval, grant, concede a thing
claimed or urged, admit a thing offered, permit, etc., etc. [OED].    Related: Allowed; allowing.
