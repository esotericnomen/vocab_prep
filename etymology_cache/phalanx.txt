1550s, line of battle in close ranks, from Latin phalanx compact body of heavily armed men in battle
array, or directly from Greek phalanx (genitive phalangos) line of battle, battle array, also finger
or toe bone, originally round piece of wood, trunk, log, of unknown origin. Perhaps from PIE root
*bhelg- plank, beam (source of Old English balca balk; see <a
href=/index.php?term=balk&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>balk</a> (n.)). The Macedonian
phalanx consisted of 50 close files of 16 men each. In anatomy, originally the whole row of finger
joints, which fit together like infantry in close order. Figurative sense of number of persons
banded together in a common cause is attested from 1600 (compare Spanish Falangist, member of a
fascist organization founded in 1933).
