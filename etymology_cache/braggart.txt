1570s, from French bragard (16c.), with pejorative ending (see <a
href=/index.php?term=-ard&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>-ard</a>) + Middle French
braguer to flaunt, brag, perhaps originally to show off clothes, especially breeches, from brague
breeches (see <a href=/index.php?term=bracket&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>bracket</a>). There may be an element of codpiece-flaunting in all this.  <br
/><br />  The word in English has been at least influenced by <a
href=/index.php?term=brag&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>brag</a> (v.), even if, as
some claim, it is unrelated to it. Bragger arrogant or boastful person, agent noun from brag (v.),
attested in English from late 14c.
