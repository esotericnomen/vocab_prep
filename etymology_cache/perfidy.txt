perfidy (n.)

1590s, from Middle French perfidie (16c.), from Latin perfidia faithlessness, falsehood, treachery,
from perfidus faithless, from phrase per fidem decipere to deceive through trustingness, from per
through (see per) + fidem (nominative fides) faith (see faith).  <blockquote>  [C]ombinations of
wickedness would overwhelm the world by the advantage which licentious principles afford, did not
those who have long practiced perfidy grow faithless to each other. [Samuel Johnson, Life of Waller]
