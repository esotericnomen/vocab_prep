abolish (v.)

mid-15c., from Middle French aboliss-, present participle stem of abolir to abolish (15c.), from
Latin abolere destroy, cause to die out, retard the growth of, perhaps from ab- from (see ab-) +
adolere to grow, from PIE *ol-eye-, causative of root *al- to grow, nourish (see old), and perhaps
formed as an antonym to adolere. But the Latin word rather could be from a root in common with Greek
ollymi, apollymi destroy. Tucker writes that there has been a confusion of forms in Latin, based on
similar roots, one meaning to grow, the other to destroy. Application to persons and concrete
objects has long been obsolete. Related: Abolished; abolishing.
