mid-15c., from Middle French aboliss-, present participle stem of abolir to abolish (15c.), from
Latin abolere destroy, cause to die out, retard the growth of, perhaps from ab- from (see <a
href=/index.php?term=ab-&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>ab-</a>) + adolere to grow,
from PIE *ol-eye-, causative of root *al- to grow, nourish (see <a
href=/index.php?term=old&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>old</a>), and perhaps formed as
an antonym to adolere. But the Latin word rather could be from a root in common with Greek ollymi,
apollymi destroy. Tucker writes that there has been a confusion of forms in Latin, based on similar
roots, one meaning to grow, the other to destroy. Application to persons and concrete objects has
long been obsolete. Related: Abolished; abolishing.
