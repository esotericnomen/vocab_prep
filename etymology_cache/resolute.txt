early 15c., dissolved, of loose structure, also morally lax, from Latin resolutus, past participle
of resolvere untie, unfasten, loose, loosen (see <a
href=/index.php?term=resolution&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>resolution</a>). Meaning
determined, decided, absolute, final is from c.1500, especially in resolute answer, a phrase common
in 16th c. [OED]. From 1530s of persons. The notion is of breaking (something) into parts as the way
to arrive at the truth of it and thus make the final determination (compare <a
