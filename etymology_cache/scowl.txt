scowl (n.)

c.1500, from scowl (v.).


scowl (v.)

mid-14c., from a Scandinavian source (compare Norwegian skule look furtively, squint, look
embarrassed, Danish skule to scowl, cast down the eyes). Probably related to Old English sceolh wry,
oblique, Old High German scelah curved, German scheel squint-eyed; from PIE root *sqel- crooked,
curved, bent. Related: Scowled; scowling.


frown (v.)

late 14c., from Old French frognier to frown or scowl, snort, turn one's nose up, related to froigne
scowling look, probably from Gaulish *frogna nostril (compare Welsh ffroen nose), with a sense of
snort, or perhaps haughty grimace. Related: Frowned; frowning.


glower (v.)

mid-14c., to shine; c.1500, to stare with wide eyes, perhaps from a Scandinavian source (compare
Norwegian dialectal glora to glow), from Proto-Germanic base *glo- (see glow (v.)), root of Old
English glowan to glow, which influenced the spelling. Or perhaps related to Middle Dutch gluren to
leer. Meaning to look angrily, scowl is first recorded 1775. Related: Glowered; glowering. As a
noun, 1715, from the verb.
