perhaps in use from 1860, probably from mash (v.) on notion either of pressing one's attentions, or
of crushing someone else's emotions (compare <a href=/index.php?term=crush&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>crush</a>).  <blockquote>  He was, to use a Western expression, a 'regular
heart-smasher among the women; and it may not be improper to state, just here, that no one had a
more exalted opinion of his capabilities in that line than the aforesaid 'Jo' himself. [Harper's New
Monthly Magazine, March 1861]  <br /><br /> <hr /> <br />  He had a weakness to be considered a
regular masher of female hearts and a very wicked young man with the fair sex generally, but there
was not a well-authenticated instance of his ever having broken a heart in his life, nor likely to
be one. [Gilbert A. Pierce, Zachariah, The Congressman, Chicago, 1880]  </blockquote>  Also in use
late 19c were mash (n.) a romantic fixation, crush (1884); mash (v.) excite sentimental admiration
(1882); mash-note love letter (1890).
