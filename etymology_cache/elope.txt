elopement (n.)

1540s, from elope + -ment. (The word was in Anglo-French in 14c.).


elope (v.)

1590s, to run off, probably from Middle Dutch (ont)lopen run away, from ont- away from (from Proto-
Germanic *und- which also gave the first element in until) + lopen to run, from Proto-Germanic
*hlaupan (see leap (v.)). Sense of run from parents to marry secretly is 19c.     However there is
an Anglo-French aloper run away from a husband with one's lover (mid-14c.) which complicates this
etymology; perhaps it is a modification of the Middle Dutch word, with Old French es-, or it is a
compound of that and Middle English lepen run, leap (see leap (v.)).    The oldest Germanic word for
wedding is represented by Old English brydlop (cognates: Old High German bruthlauft, Old Norse
bru&eth;hlaup), literally bride run, the conducting of the woman to her new home. Related: Eloped;
eloping.
