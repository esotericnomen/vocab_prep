1620s, short for plaudite an actor's request for applause (1560s), from Latin plaudite! applaud!
second person plural imperative of plaudere to clap, strike, beat; applaud, approve, of unknown
origin (also in <a href=/index.php?term=applaud&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>applaud</a>, <a href=/index.php?term=explode&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>explode</a>). This was the customary appeal for applause that Roman actors made
at the end of a play. In English, the -e went silent then was dropped.
