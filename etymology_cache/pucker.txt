pucker (n.)

1726, literal; 1741, figurative; from pucker (v.).


pucker (v.)

1590s, prob. earlier in colloquial use [OED], possibly a frequentative form of pock, dialectal
variant of poke bag, sack (see poke (n.1)), which would give it the same notion as in purse (v.).
Verbs of this type often shorten or obscure the original vowel; compare clutter, flutter, putter,
etc. [Barnhart]. Related: Puckered; puckering.


flounce (n.)

wide ruffle, 1713, from Middle English frounce pleat, wrinkle, fold (late 14c.), from Old French
fronce line, wrinkle; pucker, crease, fold, from Frankish *hrunkjan to wrinkle, from Proto-Germanic
*hrunk-. Influenced in form by flounce (v.).
