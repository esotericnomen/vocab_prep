balk (v.)

late 14c., to leave an unplowed ridge when plowing, from balk (n.). Extended meaning to omit,
intentionally neglect is mid-15c. Most modern senses are figurative, from the notion of a balk in
the fields as a hindrance or obstruction: sense of stop short (as a horse confronted with an
obstacle) is late 15c.; that of to refuse is 1580s. Related: Balked; balking.
