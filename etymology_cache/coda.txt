coda (n.)

concluding passage in a musical composition, 1753, from Latin cauda tail of an animal.


queue (n.)

late 15c., band attached to a letter with seals dangling on the free end, from French queue a tail,
from Old French cue, coe tail (12c., also penis), from Latin coda (dialectal variant or alternative
form of cauda) tail, of unknown origin. Also in literal use in 16c. English, tail of a beast,
especially in heraldry. The Middle English metaphoric extension to line of dancers (c.1500) led to
extended sense of line of people, etc. (1837). Also used 18c. in sense of braid of hair hanging down
behind (first attested 1748).


coward (n.)

mid-13c., from Old French coart coward (no longer the usual word in French, which has now in this
sense poltron, from Italian, and l&acirc;che), from coe tail, from Latin coda, popular dialect
variant of cauda tail, of uncertain origin + -ard, an agent noun suffix denoting one that carries on
some action or possesses some quality, with derogatory connotation (see -ard).    The word probably
reflects an animal metaphoric sense still found in expressions like turning tail and tail between
legs. Coart was the name of the hare in Old French versions of Reynard the Fox. Italian codardo,
Spanish cobarde are from French.    The identification of coward &amp; bully has gone so far in the
popular consciousness that persons &amp; acts in which no trace of fear is to be found are often
called coward(ly) merely because advantage has been taken of superior strength or position ....
[Fowler]    As a surname (attested from 1255) it represents Old English cuhyrde cow-herd. Farmer has
coward's castle a pulpit, Because a clergyman may deliver himself therefrom without fear of
contradiction or argument.
