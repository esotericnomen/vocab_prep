crinkle (v.)

late 14c., from frequentative of Old English crincan, variant of cringan to bend, yield (see
cringe). Related: Crinkled; crinkling. As a noun from 1590s.


crank (n.)

handle for turning a revolving axis, Old English *cranc, implied in crancst&aelig;f a weaver's
instrument, crencestre female weaver, spinster, from Proto-Germanic base *krank-, and related to
crincan to bend, yield (see crinkle, cringe). English retains the literal sense of the ancient root,
while German and Dutch krank sick, formerly weak, small, is from a figurative use. The 1825
supplement to Jamieson's Scottish dictionary has crank infirm, weak, etc.    The sense of an
eccentric person, especially one who is irrationally fixated, is first recorded 1833, said to be
from the crank of a barrel organ, which makes it play the same tune over and over; but more likely a
back-formation from cranky (q.v.). Meaning methamphetamine attested by 1989.


higgledy-piggledy

confusedly, hurriedly, 1590s, a vocal gesture [OED] probably formed from pig and the animal's
suggestions of mess and disorder. Reduplications in the h-/p- pattern are common (as in hanky-panky,
hocus-pocus, hinch(y)-pinch(y), an obsolete children's game, attested from c.1600).    Edward Moor,
Suffolk Words and Phrases (London, 1823), quotes a list of reduplications from Ray's Collection of
English Words (1768), all said to signify any confusion or mixture; the list has higgledy-piggledy,
hurly-burly, hodge-podge, mingle-mangle, arsy-versy, kim-kam, hub-bub, crawly-mauly, and hab-nab. To
which he might have added, Moor writes, crincum-crankum, crinkle-crankle, flim-flam, fiddle-faddle,
gibble-gabble, harum-scarum, helter-skelter, hiccup-suickup, hocus-pocus, hotch-potch, hugger-
mugger, hum-drum, hum-strum, hurry-scurry, jibber-jabber, prittle-prattle, shilly-shally, tittle-
tattle, and topsy-turvy. Many of them seem to date to the 16th century.
