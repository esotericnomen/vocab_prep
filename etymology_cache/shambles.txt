shambles (n.)

early 15c., meat or fish market, from schamil table, stall for vending (c.1300), from Old English
scamol, scomul stool, footstool (also figurative); bench, table for vending, an early Proto-Germanic
borrowing (Old Saxon skamel stool, Middle Dutch schamel, Old High German scamel, German schemel,
Danish skammel footstool) from Latin scamillus low stool, a little bench, ultimately a diminutive of
scamnum stool, bench, from PIE root *skabh- to prop up, support. In English, sense evolved from
place where meat is sold to slaughterhouse (1540s), then figuratively place of butchery (1590s), and
generally confusion, mess (1901, usually in plural).


shambolic (adj.)

1961, apparently from shamble in the sense disorder (see shambles), perhaps on model of symbolic.


shamble (v.)

to walk with a shuffling gait, walk awkwardly and unsteadily, 1680s, from an adjective meaning
ungainly, awkward (c.1600), from shamble (n.) table, bench (see shambles), perhaps on the notion of
the splayed legs of bench, or the way a worker sits astride it. Compare French bancal bow-legged,
wobbly (of furniture), properly bench-legged, from banc bench. The noun meaning a shambling gait is
from 1828. Related: Shambled; shambling.
