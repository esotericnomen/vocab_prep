early 15c., meat or fish market, from schamil table, stall for vending (c.1300), from Old English
scamol, scomul stool, footstool (also figurative); bench, table for vending, an early Proto-Germanic
borrowing (Old Saxon skamel stool, Middle Dutch schamel, Old High German scamel, German schemel,
Danish skammel footstool) from Latin scamillus low stool, a little bench, ultimately a diminutive of
scamnum stool, bench, from PIE root *skabh- to prop up, support. In English, sense evolved from
place where meat is sold to slaughterhouse (1540s), then figuratively place of butchery (1590s), and
generally confusion, mess (1901, usually in plural).
