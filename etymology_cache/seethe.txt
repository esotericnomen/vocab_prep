Old English seo&thorn;an to boil, also figuratively, be troubled in mind, brood (class II strong
verb; past tense sea&thorn;, past participle soden), from Proto-Germanic *seuthan (cognates: Old
Norse sjo&eth;a, Old Frisian siatha, Dutch zieden, Old High German siodan, German sieden to seethe),
from PIE root *seut- to seethe, boil.  <br /><br />  Driven out of its literal meaning by <a
href=/index.php?term=boil&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>boil</a> (v.); it survives
largely in metaphoric extensions. Figurative use, of persons or populations, to be in a state of
inward agitation is recorded from 1580s (implied in seething). It had wider figurative uses in Old
English, such as to try by fire, to afflict with cares. Now conjugated as a weak verb, and past
participle <a href=/index.php?term=sodden&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>sodden</a>
(q.v.) is no longer felt as connected.
