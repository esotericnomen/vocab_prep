plumber (n.)

late 14c. (from c.1100 as a surname), a worker in any sort of lead (roofs, gutters, pipes), from Old
French plomier lead-smelter (Modern French plombier) and directly from Latin plumbarius worker in
lead, noun use of adjective meaning pertaining to lead, from plumbum lead (see plumb (n.)). Meaning
focused 19c. on workman who installs pipes and fittings as lead water pipes became the principal
concern of the trade. In U.S. Nixon administration (1969-74), the name of a special unit for
investigation of leaks of government secrets.


crap (v.)

defecate, 1846, from one of a cluster of words generally applied to things cast off or discarded
(such as weeds growing among corn (early 15c.), residue from renderings (late 15c.), underworld
slang for money (18c.), and in Shropshire, dregs of beer or ale), all probably from Middle English
crappe grain that was trodden underfoot in a barn, chaff (mid-15c.), from Middle French crape
siftings, from Old French crappe, from Medieval Latin crappa, crapinum chaff.  Related: Crapped;
crapping.    Despite folk etymology insistence, not from Thomas Crapper (1837-1910) who was,
however, a busy plumber and may have had some minor role in the development of modern toilets. The
name Crapper is a northern form of Cropper (attested from 1221), an occupational surname, obviously,
but the exact reference is unclear. Crap (v.) as a variant of crop (v.) was noted early 19c, as a
peculiarity of speech in Scotland and the U.S. Southwest (Arkansas, etc.).    Draw out yere sword,
thou vile South'ron!  Red wat wi' blude o' my kin!  That sword it crapped the bonniest flower  E'er
lifted its head to the sun!   [Allan Cunningham (1784-1842), The Young Maxwell]
