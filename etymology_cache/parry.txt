1630s, from French parez! (which commonly would have been heard in fencing lessons), imperative of
parer ward off, from Italian parare to ward or defend a blow (see para- (2)). Related: Parried;

spar (v)

late 14c., go quickly, rush, dart, spring; c.1400, to strike or thrust, perhaps from Middle French
esparer to kick (Modern French &#233;parer), from Italian sparare to fling, from Latin ex- (see ex-)
+ parare make ready, prepare, hence ward off, parry (see pare). Etymologists consider a connection
with spur unlikely. Used in 17c. in reference to preliminary actions in a cock fight; figurative
sense of to dispute, bandy with words is from 1690s. Extension to humans, in a literal sense, with
meaning to engage in or practice boxing is attested from 1755. Related: Sparred; sparring.


ward (v.)

Old English weardian to keep guard, watch, protect, preserve, from Proto-Germanic *wardon to guard
(cognates: Old Saxon wardon, Old Norse var&eth;a to guard, Old Frisian wardia, Middle Dutch waerden
to take care of, Old High German warten to guard, look out for, expect, German warten to wait, wait
on, nurse, tend), from PIE *war-o- (see ward (n.)). French garder, Italian guardare, Spanish guardar
are Germanic loan-words. Meaning to parry, to fend off (now usually with off) is recorded from
1570s. Related: Warded; warding.
