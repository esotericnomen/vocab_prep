eugenics (n.)

1883, coined (along with adjective eugenic) by English scientist Francis Galton (1822-1911) on
analogy of ethics, physics, etc. from Greek eugenes well-born, of good stock, of noble race, from
eu- good (see eu-) + genos birth (see genus).  The investigation of human eugenics, that is, of the
conditions under which men of a high type are produced. [Galton, Human Faculty, 1883]
