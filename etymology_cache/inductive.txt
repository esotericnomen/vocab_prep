inductive (adj.)

early 15c., from Old French inductif or directly from Late Latin inductivus, from induct-, past
participle stem of inducere (see induce). As a term in logic, from 1764.


physicist (n.)

1836, from physics + -ist. Coined by the Rev. William Whewell (1794-1866), English polymath, to
denote a cultivator of physics as opposed to a physician.    As we cannot use physician for a
cultivator of physics, I have called him a physicist. We need very much a name to describe a
cultivator of science in general. I should incline to call him a Scientist. Thus we might say, that
as an Artist is a Musician, Painter, or Poet, a Scientist is a Mathematician, Physicist, or
Naturalist. [William Whewell, The Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences, London, 1840]
