Old English h&aelig;fen haven, port, from Old Norse h&ouml;fn haven, harbor or directly from Proto-
Germanic *hafno- (cognates: Danish havn, Middle Low German havene, German Hafen), perhaps from PIE
*kap- to seize, hold contain (see <a href=/index.php?term=have&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>have</a>) on notion of place that holds ships, but compare Old Norse haf, Old
English h&aelig;f sea (see <a href=/index.php?term=haff&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>haff</a>). Figurative sense of refuge, now practically the only sense, is
c.1200.
