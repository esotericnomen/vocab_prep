haven (n.)

Old English h&aelig;fen haven, port, from Old Norse h&ouml;fn haven, harbor or directly from Proto-
Germanic *hafno- (cognates: Danish havn, Middle Low German havene, German Hafen), perhaps from PIE
*kap- to seize, hold contain (see have) on notion of place that holds ships, but compare Old Norse
haf, Old English h&aelig;f sea (see haff). Figurative sense of refuge, now practically the only
sense, is c.1200.
