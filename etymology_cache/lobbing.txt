lob (v.)

send up in a slow, high arc, 1824 (implied in lobbing), but the word existed 16c. in various senses
suggesting heavy, pendant, or floppy things, and  probably is ultimately from an unrecorded Old
English word; compare East Frisian lobbe hanging lump of flesh, Dutch lob hanging lip, ruffle,
hanging sleeve, Danish lobbes clown, bumpkin. Related: Lobbed; lobbing. The noun in this sense is
from 1875, from the verb.
