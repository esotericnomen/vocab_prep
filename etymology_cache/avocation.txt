1520s, a calling away from one's occupation, from Latin avocationem (nominative avocatio) a calling
away, distraction, diversion, noun of action from past participle stem of avocare, from ab- off,

Micawber (n.)

as a type of a childishly impractical man living in optimistic fantasy, from the character of
Wilkins Micawber in Dickens' David Copperfield (1850).    I am at present, my dear Copperfield,
engaged in the sale of corn upon commission. It is not an avocation of a remunerative description --
in other words it does not pay -- and some temporary embarrassments of a pecuniary nature have been
the consequence. I am however delighted to add that I have now an immediate prospect of something
turning up ....


hobby (n.)

late 13c., hobyn, small horse, pony, later mock horse used in the morris dance, and c.1550 child's
toy riding horse, which led to hobby-horse in a transferred sense of favorite pastime or avocation,
first recorded 1670s, shortened to hobby by 1816. The connecting notion being activity that doesn't
go anywhere. Probably originally a proper name for a horse (see dobbin), a diminutive of Robert or
Robin. The original hobbyhorse was a Tourney Horse, a wooden or basketwork frame worn around the
waist and held on with shoulder straps, with a fake tail and horse head attached, so the wearer
appears to be riding a horse. These were part of church and civic celebrations at Midsummer and New
Year's throughout England.
