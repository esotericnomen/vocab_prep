wolverine (n.)

carnivorous mammal, 1610s, alteration of wolvering (1570s), of uncertain origin, possibly from
wolv-, inflectional stem of wolf (n.); or perhaps from wolver one who behaves like a wolf (1590s).


to (prep.)

Old English to in the direction of, for the purpose of, furthermore, from West Germanic *to
(cognates: Old Saxon and Old Frisian to, Dutch too, Old High German zuo, German zu to), from PIE
pronomial base *do- to, toward, upward (cognates: Latin donec as long as, Old Church Slavonic do as
far as, to, Greek suffix -de to, toward, Old Irish do, Lithuanian da-), from demonstrative *de-.
Not found in Scandinavian, where the equivalent of till (prep.) is used. In Old English, the
preposition (go to town) leveled with the adverb (the door slammed to) except where the adverb
retained its stress (tired and hungry too); there it came to be written with -oo (see too).    The
nearly universal use of to with infinitives (to sleep, to dream, etc.) arose in Middle English out
of the Old English dative use of to, and it helped drive out the Old English inflectional endings
(though in this use to itself is a mere sign, without meaning).    Commonly used as a prefix in
Middle English (to-hear listen to, etc.), but few of these survive (to-do, together, and time
references such as today, tonight, tomorrow -- Chaucer also has to-yeere). To and fro side to side
is attested from mid-14c. Phrase what's it to you how does that concern you? (1819) is a modern form
of an old question:    Hu&aelig;d is &eth;ec &eth;&aelig;s?  [John xxi:22, in Lindisfarne Gospel,
c.950]
