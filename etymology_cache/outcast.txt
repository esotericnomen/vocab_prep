mid-14c., a person cast out or rejected, originally past participle of Middle English outcasten,
from <a href=/index.php?term=out&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>out</a> + casten to
cast (see <a href=/index.php?term=cast&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>cast</a> (v.)).
The adjective is attested from late 14c. In an Indian context, outcaste one who has been expelled
from his caste is from 1876; see <a href=/index.php?term=caste&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>caste</a>.
