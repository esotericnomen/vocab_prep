cant term for dupe, sucker, credulous person, 1590s, of uncertain origin. Perhaps from verb meaning
to dupe, cheat (1540s), earlier to swallow (1520s), ultimately from gull throat, gullet (early
15c.); see <a href=/index.php?term=gullet&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>gullet</a>. Or
it is perhaps from (or influenced by) the bird (see <a
href=/index.php?term=gull&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>gull</a> (n.1)); in either
case with a sense of someone who will swallow anything thrown at him. Another possibility is Middle
English dialectal gull newly hatched bird (late 14c.), which is perhaps from Old Norse golr yellow,
from the hue of its down.
