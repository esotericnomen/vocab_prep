entomology (n.)

1766, from French entomologie (1764), coined from Greek entomon insect + -logia study of (see
-logy). Entomon is neuter of entomos having a notch or cut (at the waist), from en in (see en- (2))
+ temnein to cut (see tome).    So called by Aristotle in reference to the segmented division of
insect bodies. Compare insect. Related: Entomological. Hybrid insectology (1766, from French
insectologie, 1744) is not much used.  I have given the name insectology to that part of natural
history which has insects for its object; that of entomology ... would undoubtedly have been more
suitable ... but its barbarous sound terryfy'd me. [Charles Bonnet's English translation of his
Contemplation de la nature, 1766]
