late 16c., alteration of heyda (1520s), exclamation of playfulness or surprise, something like
Modern English hurrah, apparently an extended form of Middle English interjection hey or hei (see <a
href=/index.php?term=hey&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>hey</a>). Modern sense of stage
of greatest vigor first recorded 1751, which altered the spelling on model of day, with which this
word apparently has no etymological connection.
