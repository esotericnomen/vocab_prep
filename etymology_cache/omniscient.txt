insoluble (adj.)

late 14c., unable to be loosened, from Latin insolubilis that cannot be loosened, from in- not (see
in- (1)) + solubilis (see soluble). Figurative use, of problems, etc., is from late 14c.It was a
tacit conviction of the learned during the Middle Ages that no such thing as an insoluble question
existed. There might be matters that presented serious difficulties, but if you could lay them
before the right man -- some Arab in Spain, for instance, omniscient by reason of studies into the
details of which it was better not to inquire -- he would give you a conclusive answer. The real
trouble was only to find your man. [Gertrude Bell, The Desert and the Sown, 1907]
