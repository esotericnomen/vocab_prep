psychic drive or energy, usually associated with sexual instinct, 1892, carried over untranslated in
English edition of Krafft-Ebing's Psychopathia Sexualis; and used in 1909 in A.A. Brill's
translation of Freud's Selected Papers on Hysteria (Freud's use of the term led to its popularity);
from Latin libido desire, lust, from libere to be pleasing, to please, ultimately cognate with Old
English lufu (see <a href=/index.php?term=love&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>love</a>
(n.)).
