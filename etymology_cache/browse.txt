browser (n.)

1845, animal which browses, agent noun from browse (v.). In the computer sense by 1982.    The first
browser was invented at PARC by Larry Tesler, now a designer at Apple Computer. Tesler's first
Smalltalk browser was a tree-structured device. It enabled programmers to hunt quickly for items in
a Smalltalk dictionary. [InfoWorld magazine, vol. v., no. 4, Jan. 24, 1983]


browse (v.)

mid-15c., feed on buds, from Middle French brouster, from Old French broster to sprout, bud, from
brost young shoot, twig, probably from Proto-Germanic *brust- bud, shoot, from PIE *bhreus- to
swell, sprout (see breast (n.)). Lost its final -t in English on the mistaken notion that the letter
was a past participle inflection. Figurative extension to peruse (books) is 1870s, American English.
