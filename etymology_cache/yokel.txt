Toby

familiar form of masc. proper name Tobias, in various colloquial usages, such as jug (1840),
drinking mug in the form of a stout old man; as a type of collar (1882) it refers to that worn by
the dog Toby in 19c. Punch and Judy shows. Also in Toby show (by 1942, American English) comedy act
based on the stock character of a boisterous, blundering yokel.


villain (n.)

c.1300 (late 12c. as a surname), base or low-born rustic, from Anglo-French and Old French vilain
peasant, farmer, commoner, churl, yokel (12c.), from Medieval Latin villanus farmhand, from Latin
villa country house, farm (see villa).  The most important phases of the sense development of this
word may be summed up as follows: 'inhabitant of a farm; peasant; churl, boor; clown; miser; knave,
scoundrel.' Today both Fr. vilain and Eng. villain are used only in a pejorative sense. [Klein]
Meaning character in a novel, play, etc. whose evil motives or actions help drive the plot is from
1822.
