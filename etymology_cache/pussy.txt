pussy (n.2)

slang for female pudenda, 1879, but probably older; perhaps from Old Norse puss pocket, pouch
(compare Low German puse vulva), but perhaps instead from the cat word (see pussy (n.1)) on notion
of soft, warm, furry thing; compare French le chat, which also has a double meaning, feline and
genital. Earlier uses are difficult to distinguish from pussy (n.1), as in:The word pussie is now
used of a woman [Philip Stubbes, The Anatomie of Abuses, 1583]But the absence of pussy in Grose and
other early slang works argues against the vaginal sense being generally known before late 19c., as
does its frequent use as a term of endearment in mainstream literature, as in:What do you think,
pussy? said her father to Eva. [Harriet Beecher Stowe, Uncle Tom's Cabin, 1852]Pussy-whipped first
attested 1956.
