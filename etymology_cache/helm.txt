mid-15c., perhaps a diminutive of Old English helm protection, covering; crown, helmet (see <a
href=/index.php?term=helm&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>helm</a> (n.2)). But Barnhart
says from Middle French helmet (Modern French heaume), diminutive of helme helmet, from the same
Germanic source as helm (n.2). Middle English Dictionary points to both without making a choice. Old
English helm never became an active term in the standard vocabulary of English. [Barnhart]
