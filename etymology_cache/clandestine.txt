clandestine (adj.)

1560s, from Latin clandestinus secret, hidden, from clam secretly, from adverbial derivative of base
of celare to hide (see cell), perhaps on model of intestinus internal. Related: Clandestinely. As a
noun form, there is awkward clandestinity (clandestineness apparently being a dictionary word).
