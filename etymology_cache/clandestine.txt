1560s, from Latin clandestinus secret, hidden, from clam secretly, from adverbial derivative of base
of celare to hide (see <a href=/index.php?term=cell&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>cell</a>), perhaps on model of intestinus internal. Related: Clandestinely. As
a noun form, there is awkward clandestinity (clandestineness apparently being a dictionary word).
