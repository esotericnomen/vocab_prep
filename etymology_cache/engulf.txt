drink (v.)

Old English drincan to drink, also to swallow up, engulf (class III strong verb; past tense dranc,
past participle druncen), from Proto-Germanic *drenkan (cognates: Old Saxon drinkan, Old Frisian
drinka, Dutch drinken, Old High German trinkan, German trinken, Old Norse drekka, Gothic drigkan to
drink), of uncertain origin or connections, perhaps from a root meaning to draw.    Most Indo-
European words for this trace to PIE *po(i)- (source of Greek pino, Latin biber, Irish ibim, Old
Church Slavonic piti, Russian pit'; see imbibe).    The noun meaning beverage, alcoholic beverage
was in late Old English.  The noun, AS. drinc, would normally have given southern drinch (cf.
drench), but has been influenced by the verb. [Weekley]    To drink like a fish is first recorded
1747.
