insinuation (n.)

1520s, from Latin insinuationem (nominative insinuatio) entrance through a narrow way; an
ingratiating oneself, noun of action from past participle stem of insinuare (see insinuate).


smarmy (adj.)

smooth and sleek (1909); ingratiating, unctuous, 1924, from smarm + -y (2). Related: Smarmily;
smarminess.


poodle (n.)

1808, from German Pudel, shortened form of Pudelhund water dog, from Low German Pudel puddle
(compare pudeln to splash; see puddle (n.)) + German Hund hound (see hound (n.)). Probably so called
because the dog was used to hunt water fowl. Figurative sense of lackey (chiefly British) is
attested from 1907. Poodle-faker, British army slang for ingratiating male, is from 1902, likely
euphemistic.


unctuous (adj.)

late 14c., oily, having a greasy or soapy feeling when touched, from Old French unctueus, from
Medieval Latin unctuosus greasy, from Latin unctus act of anointing, from past participle stem of
unguere to anoint (see unguent).    Figurative sense of blandly ingratiating is first recorded 1742,
perhaps in part with a literal sense, but in part a sarcastic usage from unction in the meaning deep
spiritual feeling (1690s), such as comes from having been anointed in the rite of unction. Related:
Unctuously; unctuousness.
