bar (n.1)

late 12c., stake or rod of iron used to fasten a door or gate, from Old French barre (12c.) beam,
bar, gate, barrier, from Vulgar Latin *barra bar, barrier, which some suggest is from Gaulish
*barros the bushy end [Gamillscheg], but OED regards this as discredited because it in no way suits
the sense. Of soap, by 1833; of candy, by 1906 (the process itself dates to the 1840s). Meaning bank
of sand across a harbor or river mouth is from 1580s, probably so called because it was an
obstruction to navigation. Bar graph is attested from 1925. Bar code first recorded 1963. Behind
bars in prison is attested by 1934, U.S.
