dyspeptic (adj.)

1690s, from Greek dyspeptos hard to digest, from dys- bad (see dys-) + peptos digested, from peptein
digest (see cook (n.)).


dyspepsia (n.)

1706, from Late Latin dyspepsia or a back-formation from dyspeptic (q.v.). Its opposite is eupepsia.


neocon (n.)

by 1987, abbreviation for neo-conservative in the U.S. political sense.  Neoconservatism is the
first variant of American conservatism in the past century that is in the 'American grain.' It is
hopeful, not lugubrious; forward-looking, not nostalgic; and its general tone is cheerful, not grim
or dyspeptic. Its 20th-century heroes tend to be TR, FDR, and Ronald Reagan. Such Republican and
conservative worthies as Calvin Coolidge, Herbert Hoover, Dwight Eisenhower, and Barry Goldwater are
politely overlooked. [Irving Kristol, The Neoconservative Persuasion, in The Weekly Standard, Aug.
25, 2003]
