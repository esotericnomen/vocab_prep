tarantula (n.)

1560s, wolf spider, (Lycos tarantula), from Medieval Latin tarantula, from Italian tarantola, from
Taranto Taranto, seaport city in southern Italy in the region where the spiders are frequently
found, from Latin Tarentum, from Greek Taras (genitive Tarantos; perhaps from Illyrian darandos
oak). Its bite is only slightly poisonous. Popularly applied to other great hairy spiders,
especially the genus Mygale, native to the warmer regions of the Americas (first so called in 1794).


tarantella (n.)

1782, peasant dance popular in Italy, originally hysterical malady characterized by extreme impulse
to dance (1630s), epidemic in Apulia and adjacent parts of southern Italy 15c.-17c., popularly
attributed to (or believed to be a cure for) the bite of the tarantula. This is likely folk-
etymology, however, and the names of the dance and the spider more probably share an origin in
Taranto, the name of a city in southern Italy (see tarantula). Used from 1833 to mean the style of
music that accompanies this dance, usually in 6/8 time, with whirling triplets and abrupt major-
minor modulations. Related: Tarantism.
