1560s, wolf spider, (Lycos tarantula), from Medieval Latin tarantula, from Italian tarantola, from
Taranto Taranto, seaport city in southern Italy in the region where the spiders are frequently
found, from Latin Tarentum, from Greek Taras (genitive Tarantos; perhaps from Illyrian darandos
oak). Its bite is only slightly poisonous. Popularly applied to other great hairy spiders,
especially the genus Mygale, native to the warmer regions of the Americas (first so called in 1794).
