virtue (n.)

c.1200, vertu, moral life and conduct; a particular moral excellence, from Anglo-French and Old
French vertu force, strength, vigor; moral strength; qualities, abilities (10c. in Old French), from
Latin virtutem (nominative virtus) moral strength, high character, goodness; manliness; valor,
bravery, courage (in war); excellence, worth, from vir man (see virile).  <blockquote>  For my part
I honour with the name of virtue the habit of acting in a way troublesome to oneself and useful to
others. [Stendhal de l'Amour, 1822]  </blockquote>  Especially (in women) chastity, sexual purity
from 1590s. Phrase by virtue of (early 13c.) preserves alternative Middle English sense of efficacy.
Wyclif Bible has virtue where KJV uses power. The seven cardinal virtues (early 14c.) were divided
into the natural (justice, prudence, temperance, fortitude) and the theological (hope, faith,
charity). To make a virtue of a necessity (late 14c.) translates Latin facere de necessitate
virtutem [Jerome].
