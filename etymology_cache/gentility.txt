snob (n.)

1781, a shoemaker, a shoemaker's apprentice, of unknown origin. It came to be used in Cambridge
University slang c.1796, often contemptuously, for townsman, local merchant, and passed then into
literary use, where by 1831 it was being used for person of the ordinary or lower classes. Meaning
person who vulgarly apes his social superiors is by 1843, popularized 1848 by William Thackeray's
Book of Snobs. The meaning later broadened to include those who insist on their gentility, in
addition to those who merely aspire to it, and by 1911 the word had its main modern sense of one who
despises those considered inferior in rank, attainment, or taste.
