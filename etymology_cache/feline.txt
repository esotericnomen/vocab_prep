feline (adj.)

1680s, from Late Latin felinus of or belonging to a cat, from Latin feles (genitive felis) cat, wild
cat, marten, of uncertain origin. As a noun, from 1861.


felicide (n.)

killing of a cat, 1832, from Latin feles cat (see feline) + -cide.


cougar (n.)

1774, from French couguar, Buffon's adaption (influenced by jaguar) of a word the Portuguese picked
up in Brazil as &ccedil;u&ccedil;uarana, perhaps from Tupi susuarana, from suasu deer + rana false.
Another proposed source is Guarani gua&ccedil;u ara. Evidently the cedillas dropped off the word
before Buffon got it. Slang sense of older woman (35-plus) who seeks younger males as sex partners
is attested by 2002; said in some sources to have originated in Canada, probably from some reference
to predatory feline nature.


pussy (n.2)

slang for female pudenda, 1879, but probably older; perhaps from Old Norse puss pocket, pouch
(compare Low German puse vulva), but perhaps instead from the cat word (see pussy (n.1)) on notion
of soft, warm, furry thing; compare French le chat, which also has a double meaning, feline and
genital. Earlier uses are difficult to distinguish from pussy (n.1), as in:The word pussie is now
used of a woman [Philip Stubbes, The Anatomie of Abuses, 1583]But the absence of pussy in Grose and
other early slang works argues against the vaginal sense being generally known before late 19c., as
does its frequent use as a term of endearment in mainstream literature, as in:What do you think,
pussy? said her father to Eva. [Harriet Beecher Stowe, Uncle Tom's Cabin, 1852]Pussy-whipped first
attested 1956.
