animosity (n.)

early 15c., vigor, from Middle French animosit&eacute; (14c.) or directly from Latin animositatem
(nominative animositas) boldness, vehemence, from animosus bold, spirited, from animus (see animus).
Sense of hostile feeling is first recorded c.1600, from a secondary sense in Latin (see animus).


odium (n.)

c.1600, fact of being hated, from Latin odium ill-will, hatred, grudge, animosity; offense,
offensive conduct, related to odi I hate (infinitive odisse), from PIE root *od- to hate (cognates:
Armenian ateam I hate, Old Norse atall, Old English atol dire, horrid, loathsome). Meaning hatred,
detestation is from 1650s. Often in an extended form, such as odium theologicum hatred which is
proverbially characteristic of theological disputes (1670s).


al Qaida

also Al-Qaeda; name of a loosely structured jihadist movement founded c.1989 by Osama bin Laden;
from Arabic, literally the base. A common Arabic term among Muslim radicals from the wider Islamic
world who came to Afghanistan in 1980s and fought alongside local rebels against the Soviets, and
who regarded themselves and their struggle not merely in Afghan terms but as the base or foundation
of a wider jihad and revival in Islam. Used by Bin Laden's mentor, Abdallah Azzam (1941-1989), who
referred to the vanguard which constitutes the strong foundation [al-qaida al-sulbah] for the
expected society. In U.S., the term first turns up in a CIA report in 1996.    Every Muslim, from
the moment they realise the distinction in their hearts, hates Americans, hates Jews, and hates
Christians. This is a part of our belief and our religion. For as long as I can remember, I have
felt tormented and at war, and have felt hatred and animosity for Americans. [Osama bin Laden,
interview aired on Al-Jazeera, December 1998]
