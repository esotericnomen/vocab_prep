brusque (adj.)

1650s, from French brusque lively, fierce, from Italian adjective brusco sharp, tart, rough, perhaps
from Vulgar Latin *bruscum butcher's broom plant.


brisk (adj.)

1550s, as Scottish bruisk, probably an alteration of French brusque (see brusque). Related: Briskly;
briskness.


terse (adj.)

1590s (implied in tersely), clean-cut, burnished, neat, from French ters clean, and directly from
Latin tersus wiped off, clean, neat, from past participle of tergere to rub, polish, wipe. Sense of
concise or pithy in style or language is from 1777, which led to a general sense of neatly concise.
The pejorative meaning brusque is a fairly recent development. Related: Terseness.
