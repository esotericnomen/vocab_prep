berserk (adj.)

1844, from berserk (n.) Norse warrior, by 1835, an alternative form of berserker (1822), a word
which was introduced by Sir Walter Scott, from Old Norse berserkr (n.) raging warrior of superhuman
strength; probably from *ber- bear + serkr shirt, thus literally a warrior clothed in bearskin. Thus
not from Old Norse berr bare, naked.    Thorkelin, in the essay on the Berserkir, appended to his
edition of the Krisini Saga, tells that an old name of the Berserk frenzy was hamremmi, i.e.,
strength acquired from another strange body, because it was anciently believed that the persons who
were liable to this frenzy were mysteriously endowed, during its accesses, with a strange body of
unearthly strength. If, however, the Berserk was called on by his own name, he lost his mysterious
form, and his ordinary strength alone remained. [Notes and Queries, Dec. 28, 1850]     The
adjectival use probably is from such phrases as berserk frenzy, or as a title (Arngrim the Berserk).


berserker (n.)

alternative form of berserk (q.v.), from Old Norse berserkr, accusative of berserk. This is the
oldest form of the word in its revival in Modern English (1822), and perhaps Scott, who introduced
it, mistook the -r for an agent-noun suffix. Further compicated because it has the form of the Old
Norse plural, and English berserker sometimes is plural.


sark (n.)

shirt, body garment of linen or cotton for either sex, late Old English serc shirt, corselet, coat
of mail, surviving as a Scottish and northern dialect word, from Old Norse serkr, cognate with Old
English serk (see berserk). But Gordon lists it as a loan-word from Latin sarcia; other sources are
silent on the point. Lithuanian sarkas shirt, Old Church Slavonic sraka tunic, Russian soro&#269;ka,
Finnish sarkki shirt perhaps are all from Germanic.
