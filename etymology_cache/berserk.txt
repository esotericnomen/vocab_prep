berserk (adj.)

1844, from berserk (n.) Norse warrior, by 1835, an alternative form of berserker (1822), a word
which was introduced by Sir Walter Scott, from Old Norse berserkr (n.) raging warrior of superhuman
strength; probably from *ber- bear + serkr shirt, thus literally a warrior clothed in bearskin. Thus
not from Old Norse berr bare, naked.  <blockquote>  Thorkelin, in the essay on the Berserkir,
appended to his edition of the Krisini Saga, tells that an old name of the Berserk frenzy was
hamremmi, i.e., strength acquired from another strange body, because it was anciently believed that
the persons who were liable to this frenzy were mysteriously endowed, during its accesses, with a
strange body of unearthly strength. If, however, the Berserk was called on by his own name, he lost
his mysterious form, and his ordinary strength alone remained. [Notes and Queries, Dec. 28, 1850]
</blockquote>  The adjectival use probably is from such phrases as berserk frenzy, or as a title
(Arngrim the Berserk).
