dapple (v.)

early 15c. (implied in past participle adjective dappled), perhaps from a Scandinavian source akin
to Old Norse depill spot, Norwegian dape puddle. Perhaps a back-formation from, or merger with,
Middle English adjective dapple-gray apple-gray (late 14c.), based on resemblance to the markings on
an apple (compare Old Norse apalgrar dapple-gray), or, as it was used of gray horses with round
blotches, perhaps via resemblance to apples themselves.
