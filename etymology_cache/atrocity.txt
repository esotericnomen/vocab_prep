atrocity (n.)

1530s, from Middle French atrocit&eacute; or directly from Latin atrocitatem (nominative atrocitas)
cruelty, fierceness, harshness, noun of quality from atrox fierce, cruel, frightful, from PIE *atro-
ek-, from root *ater- fire (see atrium) + *okw- see (see eye (n.)); thus of fiery or threatening
appearance. The meaning an atrocious deed is from 1793.


atrocious (adj.)

1660s, from stem of Latin atrox fierce, savage, cruel (see atrocity) + -ous. Colloquial sense very
bad is late 19c. Related: Atrociously; atrociousness.


enormity (n.)

late 15c., transgression, crime, irregularity, from Old French &eacute;normit&eacute; extravagance,
enormity, atrocity, heinous sin, from Latin enormitatem (nominative enormitas) hugeness, vastness,
irregularity, from enormis (see enormous). Meaning extreme wickedness in English attested from
1560s; sense of hugeness (1792) is etymological but probably best avoided to prevent
misunderstanding.


atrabilious (adj.)

1650s, from Latin atra bilis, translating Greek melankholia black bile (see melancholy; also compare
bile). Atra is fem. of ater black, dark, gloomy, perhaps related to root of atrocity. Related:
Atrabiliousness.


Gramophone (n.)

1887, trademark by German-born U.S. inventor Emil Berliner (1851-1929), an inversion of phonogram
(1884) the tracing made by a phonograph needle, coined from Greek phone voice, sound (see fame (n.))
+ gramma something written (see grammar).    Berliner's machine used a flat disc and succeeded with
the public. Edison's phonograph used a cylinder and did not. Despised by linguistic purists (Weekley
calls gramophone An atrocity formed by reversing phonogram) who tried to at least amend it to
grammophone, it was replaced by record player after mid-1950s.
