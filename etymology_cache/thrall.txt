late Old English &thorn;r&aelig;l bondman, serf, slave, from a Scandinavian source akin to Old Norse
&thorn;r&aelig;ll slave, servant, figuratively wretch, scoundrel, probably from Proto-Germanic
*thrakhilaz, literally runner, from root *threh- to run (cognates: Old High German dregil servant,
properly runner; Old English &thorn;r&aelig;gan, Gothic &thorn;ragjan to run). Meaning condition of
servitude is from early 14c.
