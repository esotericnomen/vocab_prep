endorse (v.)

put on (see en- (1)) + dos back, from Latin dossum, variant of dorsum.    Sense of confirm, approve
(by signing on the back) is recorded in English first in 1847. Assimilated 16c. in form to Medieval

papers, &amp;, metaphorically, a claim or argument, but to talk of endorsing material things other
than papers is a solecism. [Fowler]
