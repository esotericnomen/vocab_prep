inditement (n.)

1560s, action of writing prose or verse, from indite + -ment.


indite (v.)

late 14c., put down in writing, from Old French enditer, from Vulgar Latin *indictare, from Latin
in- in, into, on, upon (see in- (2)) + dictare â&euro;&oelig;to declareâ&euro;? (see dictate). The
same word as indict but retaining a French form. Related: Indited; inditing.


lynch (v.)

1835, from earlier Lynch law (1811), likely named after William Lynch (1742-1820) of Pittsylvania,
Virginia, who c.1780 led a vigilance committee to keep order there during the Revolution. Other
sources trace the name to Charles Lynch (1736-1796) a Virginia magistrate who fined and imprisoned
Tories in his district c.1782, but the connection to him is less likely. Originally any sort of
summary justice, especially by flogging; narrowing of focus to extralegal execution by hanging is
20c. Lynch mob is attested from 1838. The surname is perhaps from Irish Loingseach sailor. Compare
earlier Lydford law, from a place in Dartmoor, England, where was held a Stannaries Court of summary
jurisdiction [Weekley], hence:   Lydford law: is to hang men first, and indite them afterwards.
