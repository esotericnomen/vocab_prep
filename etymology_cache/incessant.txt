incessant (adj.)

mid-15c., from Old French incessant (mid-14c.), from Late Latin incessantem (nominative incessans)
unceasing, from Latin in- not (see in- (1)) + cessantem (nominative cessans), present participle of
cessare cease (see cease). Related: Incessantly (early 15c.).


incessancy (n.)

1610s; see incessant + -cy.


assiduous (adj.)

1530s, from Latin assiduus attending; continually present, incessant; busy; constant, from assidere
to sit down to, thus constantly occupied at one's work; from ad to (see ad-) + sedere to sit (see
sedentary). The word acquired a taint of servility in 18c. Related: Assiduously; assiduousness.


katydid (n.)

insect of the locust family (Microsentrum rhombifolium), 1784, American English (perhaps first used
by John Bartram), imitative of the stridulous sound the male makes when it rubs its front wings
together. The sound itself is more accurately transcribed from 1751 as catedidist.    [T]heir noise
is loud and incessant, one perpetually and regularly answering the other in notes exactly similar to
the words Katy did, or Katy Katy did, repeated by one, and another immediately bawls out Katy
didn't, or Katy Katy didn't. In this loud clamour they continue without ceasing until the fall of
the leaf, when they totally disappear. [J.F.D. Smyth, A Tour in the United States of America, 1784]
