blood-red, late 14c. (late 12c. as a surname), from Old French sanguin (fem. sanguine), from Latin
sanguineus of blood, also bloody, bloodthirsty, from sanguis (genitive sanguinis) blood (see <a
href=/index.php?term=sanguinary&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>sanguinary</a>). Meaning
cheerful, hopeful, confident first attested c.1500, because these qualities were thought in medieval
physiology to spring from an excess of blood as one of the four humors. Also in Middle English as a
noun, type of red cloth (early 14c.).
