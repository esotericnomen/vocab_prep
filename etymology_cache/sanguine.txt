sanguine (adj.)

blood-red, late 14c. (late 12c. as a surname), from Old French sanguin (fem. sanguine), from Latin
sanguineus of blood, also bloody, bloodthirsty, from sanguis (genitive sanguinis) blood (see
sanguinary). Meaning cheerful, hopeful, confident first attested c.1500, because these qualities
were thought in medieval physiology to spring from an excess of blood as one of the four humors.
Also in Middle English as a noun, type of red cloth (early 14c.).


sanguinity (n.)

late 15c., consanguinity; see sanguine + -ity. Meaning quality of being sanguine is from 1737.


temperament (n.)

late 14c., proportioned mixture of elements, from Latin temperamentum proper mixture, a mixing in
due proportion, from temperare to mix (see temper (v.)). In medieval theory, it meant a combination
of qualities (hot, cold, moist, dry) that determined the nature of an organism; thus also a
combination of the four humors (sanguine, choleric, phlegmatic, and melancholic) that made up a
person's characteristic disposition. General sense of habit of mind, natural disposition is from
1821.


consanguinity (n.)

c.1400, from Middle French consanguinit&eacute;, from Latin consanguinitatem (nominative
consanguinitas), from consanguineus consanguineous, of the same blood, from com- together (see com-)
+ sanguineus of blood (see sanguine).
