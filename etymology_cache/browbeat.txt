browbeat (v.)

to bully, originally to bear down with stern or arrogant looks, 1580s, from brow + beat (v.).
<blockquote>  [I]t appears from the earliest quotations ... that the brow in question was that of
the beater, not of the beaten party; but it is not evident whether the meaning was 'to beat with
one's (frowning) brows,' or 'to beat (?lower) one's brows at.' [OED]  </blockquote>  Related:
Browbeaten; browbeating.
