to bully, originally to bear down with stern or arrogant looks, 1580s, from <a
href=/index.php?term=brow&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>brow</a> + <a
href=/index.php?term=beat&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>beat</a> (v.).  <blockquote>
[I]t appears from the earliest quotations ... that the brow in question was that of the beater, not
of the beaten party; but it is not evident whether the meaning was 'to beat with one's (frowning)
brows,' or 'to beat (?lower) one's brows at.' [OED]  </blockquote>  Related: Browbeaten;
browbeating.
