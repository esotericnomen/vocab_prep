browbeat (v.)

to bully, originally to bear down with stern or arrogant looks, 1580s, from brow + beat (v.).
[I]t appears from the earliest quotations ... that the brow in question was that of the beater, not
of the beaten party; but it is not evident whether the meaning was 'to beat with one's (frowning)
brows,' or 'to beat (?lower) one's brows at.' [OED]    Related: Browbeaten; browbeating.


frumpy (adj.)

1746, cross-tempered, from frump (n.) bad temper (1660s) and an earlier verb meaning to mock,
browbeat (1550s), of obscure origin, perhaps imitative of a sneer or derisive snort. Sense of sour-
looking, unfashionable is from 1825, but this may be a shortening of frumple to wrinkle, crumple
(late 14c.), from Middle Dutch verrompelen, from ver- completely + rompelen to rumple. Related:
Frumps. See also frump.
