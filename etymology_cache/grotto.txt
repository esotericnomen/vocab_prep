grotto (n.)

1610s, from Italian grotta, ultimately from Latin crypta vault, cavern, from Greek krypte hidden
place (see crypt). Terminal -o may be from its being spelled that way in many translations of
Dante's Divine Comedy.


grot (n.)

short for grotto, c.1500; perhaps from or influenced by French grotte.


Lupercalia (n.)

Roman festival held Feb. 15, in honor of Lupercus, god (identified with Lycean Pan) who had a grotto
at the foot of the Palatine Hill, from Latin Lupercalia (plural), from Lupercalis pertaining to
Lupercus, whose name derives from lupus wolf (see wolf (n.)).


spelunk (n.)

a cave, cavern, a vault, c.1300, from Old French spelonque (13c.) or directly from Latin spelunca a
cave, cavern, grotto, from Greek spelynx (accusative spelynga, genitive spelyngos) a cave, cavern,
from spelos a cave. An adjective, speluncar of a cave is recorded from 1855.


grotesque (adj.)

c.1600s, originally a noun (1560s), from Middle French crotesque (16c., Modern French grotesque),
from Italian grottesco, literally of a cave, from grotta (see grotto). The usual explanation is that
the word first was used of paintings found on the walls of basements of Roman ruins (Italian pittura
grottesca), which OED finds intrinsically plausible. Originally fanciful, fantastic, sense became
pejorative after mid-18c. Related: Grotesquely; grotesqueness.


crypt (n.)

early 15c., grotto, cavern, from Latin crypta vault, cavern, from Greek krypte (short for krypte
kamara hidden vault), fem. of kryptos hidden, verbal adjective from kryptein to hide, from PIE
*krau- to conceal, hide (cognates: Old Church Slavonic kryjo, kryti to hide). Meaning underground
burial vault or chapel in a church first attested 1789.
