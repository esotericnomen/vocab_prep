carrion (n.)

early 13c., carione, from Anglo-French carogne (Old North French caroigne; Old French charogne,
12c., carrion, corpse, Modern French charogne), from Vulgar Latin *caronia carcass (source of
Italian carogna, Spanish carro&ntilde;a carrion), from Latin caro meat (see carnage).


crone (n.)

late 14c., from Anglo-French carogne, from Old North French carogne, term of abuse for a
cantankerous or withered woman, literally carrion, from Vulgar Latin *caronia (see carrion).


crow (v.)

Old English crawian make a loud noise like a crow  (see crow (n.)); sense of exult in triumph is
1520s, perhaps in part because the English crow is a carrion-eater. Related: Crowed; crowing.


carbine (n.)

short rifle, 1580s, from French carabine (Middle French carabin), used of light horsemen and also of
the weapon they carried, of uncertain origin, perhaps from Medieval Latin Calabrinus Calabrian
(i.e., rifle made in Calabria). A less-likely theory (Gamillscheg, etc.) connects it to Old French
escarrabin corpse-bearer during the plague, literally (probably) carrion beetle, said to have been
an epithet for archers from Flanders.
