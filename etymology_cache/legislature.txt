legislature (n.)

1670s; see legislator + -ure.


bourbon (n.)

type of American corn whiskey, 1846, from Bourbon County, Kentucky, where it first was made,
supposedly in 1789. Bourbon County was organized 1785, one of the nine established by the Virginia
legislature before Kentucky became a state. The name reflects the fondness felt in the United States
for the French royal family, and especially Louis XVI, in gratitude for the indispensable support he
had given to the rebel colonists. See Bourbon.


senate (n.)

c.1200, legal and administrative body of ancient Rome, from Old French senat or Latin senatus
highest council of the state in ancient Rome, literally council of elders, from senex (genitive
senis) old man, old (see senile). Attested from late 14c. in reference to governing bodies of free
cities in Europe; of national governing bodies from 1550s; specific sense of upper house of U.S.
legislature is recorded from 1775.


knothead (n.)

stupid person, by 1899, American English, from knot (n.) + head (n.). Joe Knothead is the name of a
character in an 1857 blackface satire publication. And a local history from Massachusetts published
in 1879 describes an old-time character known as knot-head because [d]uring the hottest days of
summer ... he worked bare-headed in the sun ....   Knothead also was used as a term in cattle and
sheep raising, defined in 1922 as a type of poorly bred, stunted northern cattle, about the size of
yearlings, but with heavy horns indicating that they are older. It turns up, however, in an 1849
petition to the Ohio Legislature, recommending a certain person for a court position, in part
because he is a knot-head, which the report of the petition notes is a term of praise for a judge
because they are asked to untangle knotty legal questions, but which phrase, it adds, is believed
not to be in use among gentlemen in the north part of the State. [Appendix to the Journal of the
Ohio House of Representatives, Session of 1848-9]
