due (adj.)

early 14c., customary, regular; mid-14c., owing, payable, from Old French deu, past participle of
devoir to owe, from Latin debere to owe (see debt).    In reference to points of the compass (as in
due east) it is attested from c.1600, originally nautical, from notion of fitting, rightful. As an
adverb from 1590s; as a noun from early 15c. Prepositional phrase due to (much maligned by
grammarians) is from 1897.


insolent (adj.)

late 14c., contemptuous, arrogant, haughty, from Latin insolentem (nominative insolens) arrogant,
immoderate, literally unusual, from in- not, opposite of (see in- (1)) + solentem, present
participle of solere be accustomed, which possibly is related to sodalis close companion, and to
suescere become used to. Meaning contemptuous of rightful authority is from 1670s. Related:
Insolently.


obnoxious (adj.)

1580s, subject to the authority of another, from Latin obnoxiosus hurtful, injurious, from obnoxius
subject, exposed to harm, from ob to, toward (see ob-) + noxa injury, hurt, damage entailing
liability (see noxious). Meaning subject to something harmful is 1590s; meaning offensive, hateful
is first recorded 1670s, influenced by noxious.Obnoxious has two very different senses, one of which
(exposed or open or liable to attack or injury) requires notice because its currency is now so
restricted that it is puzzling to the uninstructed. It is the word's rightful or de jure meaning,
and we may hope that scholarly writers will keep it alive. [Fowler]  Related: Obnoxiously;
obnoxiousness.
