tarnish (n.)

1713, from tarnish (v.).


tarnish (v.)

mid-15c. (transitive), from present participle stem of Middle French ternir dull the luster or
brightness of, make dim (15c.), probably from Old French terne (adj.) dull, dark, which according to
Diez is from a Germanic source cognate with Old High German tarnjan to conceal, hide, Old English
dyrnan to hide, darken, from Proto-Germanic *darnjaz (see dern), but there are difficulties of form,
sense, and date. Intransitive sense from 1670s. Figurative sense is from 1690s. Related: Tarnished;
tarnishing.


spot (v.)

mid-13c., to mark or stain with spots; late 14c. as to stain, sully, tarnish, from spot (n.).
Meaning to see and recognize, is from 1718, originally colloquial and applied to a criminal or
suspected person; the general sense is from 1860. Related: Spotted; spotting. Spotted dick suet
pudding with currants and raisins is attested from 1849.


stainless (adj.)

1580s, from stain (n.) + -less. Related: Stainlessly. Stainless steel is from 1917, a chromium-steel
alloy (usually 14% chromium) used for cutlery, etc., so called because it is highly resistant to
rust or tarnish.


dern (adj.)

secret, hidden (obsolete), from Old English derne concealed, secret, dark, from West Germanic
*darnjaz (cognates: Old Saxon derni, Old Frisian dern concealed, dark, Old High German tarni secret,
concealed, veiled).    As a verb, to conceal, from Old English diernan to hide. Compare Old High
German tarnjan to conceal, hide; German Tarnkappe, Tarnhelm magical cap or helmet which turns the
wearer invisible or allows him to assume any form. Related to dark (adj.). French ternir to tarnish,
to dull apparently is a Germanic loan-word.
