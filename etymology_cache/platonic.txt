1530s, of or pertaining to Greek philosopher Plato (429 B.C.E.-c.347 B.C.E.), from Latin Platonicus,
from Greek Platonikos. The name is Greek Platon, properly broad-shouldered (from platys broad; see
<a href=/index.php?term=plaice&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>plaice</a> (n.)). His
original name was Aristocles. The meaning love free of sensual desire (1630s), which the word
usually carries nowadays, is a Renaissance notion; it is based on Plato's writings in Symposium
about the kind of interest Socrates took in young men, which originally had no reference to women.
