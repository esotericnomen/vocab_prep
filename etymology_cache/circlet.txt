(cognates: Old Norse hringr, Old Frisian hring, Danish, Swedish, Dutch ring, Old High German hring,
German Ring), from PIE *(s)kregh- nasalized form of (s)kregh-, from root *(s)ker- (3) to turn, bend,
with wide-ranging derivative senses (cognates: Latin curvus bent, curved, crispus curly; Old Church
Slavonic kragu circle, and perhaps Greek kirkos ring, koronos curved).    Other Old English senses

(early 14c.) is from the space in a circle of bystanders in the midst of which such contests once
were held, ... a circle formed for boxers, wrestlers, and cudgel players, by a man styled Vinegar;
who, with his hat before his eyes, goes round the circle, striking at random with his whip to
prevent the populace from crowding in [Grose, 1785]. Meaning combination of interested persons is
from 1829. Of trees, from 1670s; fairy ring is from 1620s. Ring finger is Old English hringfingr, a
compound found in other Germanic languages. To run rings round (someone) be superior to is from
1891.    Nursery rhyme ring a ring a rosie is attested in an American form (with a different ending)
from c.1790. The belief that the rhyme originated with the Great Plague is now almost universal, but
has no evidence to support it and is almost certainly nonsense [Oxford Dictionary of English
Folklore]. This proposal of connection dates only to the late 1960s.
