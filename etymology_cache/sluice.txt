sluice (v.)

1590s, from sluice (n.). Related: Sluiced; sluicing.


sluice (n.)

c.1400, earlier scluse (mid-14c.), a shortening of Old French escluse sluice, floodgate (Modern
French &#233;cluse), from Late Latin exclusa barrier to shut out water (in aqua exclusa water shut
out, i.e. separated from the river), from fem. singular of Latin exclusus, past participle of
excludere to shut out (see exclude).


sewer (n.1)

c.1400, conduit, from Anglo-French sewere, Old North French sewiere sluice from a pond (13c.),
literally something that makes water flow, from shortened form of Gallo-Roman *exaquaria (source of
Middle French esseveur), from Latin ex- out (see ex-) + aquaria, fem. of aquarius pertaining to
water, from aqua water (see aqua-).    Specifically of underground channels for wastewater from
c.1600; figurative use of this is from 1640s.


lock (n.1)

means of fastening, Old English loc bolt, fastening; barrier, enclosure, from Proto-Germanic *lukan
(cognates: Old Norse lok fastening, lock, Gothic usluks opening, Old High German loh dungeon, German
Loch opening, hole, Dutch luik shutter, trapdoor). The great diversity of meaning in the Teut. words
seems to indicate two or more independent but formally identical substantival formations from the
root.    The Old English sense barrier, enclosure led to the specific meaning barrier on a river
(c.1300), and the more specific sense gate and sluice system on a water channel used as a means of
raising and lowering boats (1570s). Wrestling sense is from c.1600. Phrase under lock and key
attested from early 14c.
