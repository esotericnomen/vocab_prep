unilateralism (n.)

1926, from unilateral + -ism. Earliest usages seem to be in the sense of advocate of unilateral
disarmament. Meaning pursuit of a foreign policy without allies is attested by 1964.


unilateral (adj.)

1802, from Modern Latin unilateralis, from unum, neuter of unus one (see one) + latus (genitive
lateralis) side (see oblate (n.)). Jeremy Bentham (1748-1832) may have been the first to use it in
the legal sense of made or entered into by one party. Related: Unilaterally. Unilateral disarmament
is recorded from 1929.    It is useless for the sheep to pass resolutions in favor of vegetarianism,
while the wolf remains of a different opinion. [William Ralph Inge, Outspoken Essays, 1919]

also Moebius, 1904 in reference to the Mobius strip (earlier Moebius unilateral paper strip, 1899),
named for German mathematician August Ferdinand M&ouml;bius (1790-1868), professor at Leipzig, who
devised it and described it in 1865 (Ã¼ber die Bestimmung des Inhalts eines Polyeders, Nov. 27,
1865).
