c.1600, from Middle French carnage (16c.), from Old Italian carnaggio slaughter, murder, from
Medieval Latin carnaticum flesh, from Latin carnaticum slaughter of animals, from carnem (nominative
caro) flesh, originally a piece of flesh, from PIE root *(s)ker- (1) to cut (see <a
href=/index.php?term=shear&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>shear</a> (v.)). In English
always used more of slaughters of men than beasts. Southey (1795) tried to make a verb of it.
