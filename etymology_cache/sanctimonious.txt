sanctimonious (adj.)

c.1600 (in Measure for Measure, with the disparaging sense making a show of sanctity, affecting an
appearance of holiness), from sanctimony + -ous. The un-ironic, literal sense was used occasionally
in English from c.1600 to c.1800. Related: Sanctimoniously; sanctimoniousness.
