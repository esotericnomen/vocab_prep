somber (adj.)

1760 gloomy, shadowy (earlier sombrous, c.1730), from French sombre dark, gloomy, from Old French
sombre (14c.), from an adjective from Late Latin subumbrare to shadow, from sub under (see sub-) +
umbra shade, shadow, perhaps from a suffixed form of PIE *andho- blind, dark (see umbrage). Related:
Somberly; somberness.
