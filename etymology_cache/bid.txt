probably a merger of two old words: The sense in bid farewell is from Old English biddan to ask,
entreat, pray, beseech; order; beg (class V strong verb, past tense b&aelig;d, past participle
beden), from Proto-Germanic *bidjan to pray, entreat (source also of German bitten to ask, attested
from 8c.), which, according to Kluge and Watkins is from a PIE root *gwhedh- to ask, pray (see <a
href=/index.php?term=bead&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>bead</a> (n.)).  <br /><br />
To bid at an auction, meanwhile, is from Old English beodan offer, proclaim (class II strong verb;
past tense bead, past participle boden), from Proto-Germanic *beudan to stretch out, reach out,
offer, present, (source also of German bieten to offer), from PIE root *bheudh- to be aware, make
aware (cognates: Sanskrit bodhati is awake, is watchful, observes, buddhah awakened, enlightened;
Old Church Slavonic bljudo to observe; Lithuanian budeti to be awake; Old Irish buide contentment,
thanks). As a noun, 1788, from the verb.
