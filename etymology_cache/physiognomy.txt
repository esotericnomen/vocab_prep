physiognomy (n.)

late 14c., art of judging characters from facial features, from Old French phizonomie and directly
from Late Latin physiognomia, from Greek physiognomia the judging of a person's nature by his
features, from physio- (see physio-) + gnomon (genitive gnomonos) judge, indicator (see gnomon).
Meaning face, countenance, features is from c.1400. Related: Physiognomical.


phiz (n.)

1680s, jocular abbreviation of physiognomy; hence face, countenance, facial expression.


pyromania (n.)

1840, from pyro- fire + mania madness, frenzy. Used in German in the 1830s.    The propensity which
leads an insane person to accomplish his purpose by burning, has been considered to merit particular
notice, and to constitute a variety of monomania. Dr. Marc, of France, has published a memoir on the
subject; he gives the name of pyromania to it, and considers that, like other insane propensities,
it may be the result of instinct, or it may be the result of delusion--reasoning upon erroneous
principles. [Alexander Morrison, M.D., The Physiognomy of Mental Diseases, London, 1840]    An older
word for it was incendiarism.
