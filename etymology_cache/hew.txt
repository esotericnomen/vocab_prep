Old English heawan to chop, hack, gash (class VII strong verb; past tense heow, past participle
heawen), earlier geheawan, from Proto-Germanic *hawwan (cognates: Old Norse hoggva, Old Frisian
hawa, Old Saxon hauwan, Middle Dutch hauwen, Dutch houwen, Old High German houwan, German hauen to
cut, strike, hew), from PIE root *kau- to hew, strike (cognates: Old Church Slavonic kovo,
Lithuanian kauju to beat, forge; Latin cudere to strike, beat; Middle Irish cuad beat, fight).  <br
/><br />  Weak past participle hewede appeared 14c., but hasn't displaced <a

contradictory sense of hold fast, stick to (in phrase hew to) developed from hew to the line stick
to a course, literally cut evenly with an axe or saw, first recorded 1891. Related: Hewed; hewing.
