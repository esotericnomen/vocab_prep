hew (v.)

Old English heawan to chop, hack, gash (class VII strong verb; past tense heow, past participle
heawen), earlier geheawan, from Proto-Germanic *hawwan (cognates: Old Norse hoggva, Old Frisian
hawa, Old Saxon hauwan, Middle Dutch hauwen, Dutch houwen, Old High German houwan, German hauen to
cut, strike, hew), from PIE root *kau- to hew, strike (cognates: Old Church Slavonic kovo,
Lithuanian kauju to beat, forge; Latin cudere to strike, beat; Middle Irish cuad beat, fight).
Weak past participle hewede appeared 14c., but hasn't displaced hewn. Seemingly contradictory sense
of hold fast, stick to (in phrase hew to) developed from hew to the line stick to a course,
literally cut evenly with an axe or saw, first recorded 1891. Related: Hewed; hewing.
