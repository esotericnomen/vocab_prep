stanch (v.)

to stop the flow of (especially of blood), early 14c., from Old French estanchier cause to cease
flowing (of blood), stop, hinder; extinguish (of fire); tire, exhaust, drain (Modern French
&#233;tancher), from Vulgar Latin *stancare, perhaps contracted from *stagnicare, from Latin stagnum
pond, pool (see stagnate). But Barnhart says it probably is from Latin stantio, present participle
of stare to stand.
