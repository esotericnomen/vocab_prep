sandwich (n.)

1762, said to be a reference to John Montagu (1718-1792), Fourth Earl Sandwich, who was said to be
an inveterate gambler who ate slices of cold meat between bread at the gaming table during marathon
sessions rather than get up for a proper meal (this account dates to 1770). It was in his honor that
Cook named the Hawaiian islands (1778) when Montagu was first lord of the Admiralty. The family name
is from the place in Kent, Old English Sandwic&aelig;, literally sandy harbor (or trading center).
For pronunciation, see cabbage. Sandwich board, one carried before and one behind, is from 1864.
