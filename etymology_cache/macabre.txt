early 15c., originally in reference to a kind of morality show or allegorical representation of
death and his victims, from Old French (danse) Macabr&eacute; (dance) of Death (1376), of uncertain
origin, probably a translation of Medieval Latin (Chorea) Machab&aelig;orum, literally dance of the
Maccabees (leaders of the Jewish revolt against Syro-Hellenes; see <a
href=/index.php?term=Maccabees&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>Maccabees</a>). The
association with the dance of death seems to be from vivid descriptions of the martyrdom of the
Maccabees in the Apocryphal books. The abstracted sense of gruesome is first attested 1842 in
French, 1889 in English.  <blockquote>  The typical form which the allegory takes is that of a
series of pictures, sculptured or painted, in which Death appears, either as a dancing skeleton or
as a shrunken corpse wrapped in grave-clothes to persons representing every age and condition of
life, and leads them all in a dance to the grave. [Encyclopaedia Britannica, 11th ed., 1911]
