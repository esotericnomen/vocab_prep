slag (v.)

denigrate, by 1971, from slag (n.) in a secondary sense of worthless person (1788). Related:

slag (n.)

refuse from smelting, 1550s, from Middle Low German slagge (German Schlacke) splinter flying off
when metal is struck, related to Old High German slahan to strike, slay (see slay (v.)).


slack (n.2)

coal dust, mid-15c., sleck, of uncertain origin, probably related to Middle Dutch slacke, Middle Low
German slecke slag, small pieces left after coal is screened, perhaps related to slagge splinter
flying off metal when it is struck (see slag (n.)).


cinder (n.)

Old English sinder dross of iron, slag, from Proto-Germanic *sendra- slag (cognates: Old Saxon
sinder slag, dross, Old Norse sindr, Middle Low German and Middle Dutch sinder, Dutch sintel, Old
High German sintar, German Sinter), from PIE root *sendhro- coagulating fluid (cognates: Old Church
Slavonic sedra cinder).    Initial s- changed to c- under influence of unrelated French cendre
ashes, from Latin cinerem (nominative cinis) ashes, from or related to Greek konis dust (see
incinerate). The French word also apparently shifted the sense of the English one to small piece of
burnt coal (16c.). Volcanic cinder cone is recorded from 1849.


clinker (n.)

mass of slag, 1769, from klincard (1640s), a type of paving brick made in Holland, from Dutch

hence clinker-built (1769). The meaning stupid mistake is first recorded 1950 in American English;
originally (1942) a wrong note in music.


schlock (n.)

trash, 1915, from American Yiddish shlak, from German Schlacke dregs, scum, dross (see slag (n.)).
Alternative etymology [OED] is from Yiddish shlogn to strike (cognate with German schlagen; see
slay). Derived form schlockmeister purveyor of cheap merchandise is from 1965. Adjectival form
schlocky is attested from 1968; schlock was used as an adjective from 1916.
