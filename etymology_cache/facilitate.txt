skid (n.)

c.1600, beam or plank on which something rests, especially on which something heavy can be rolled
from place to place (1782), of uncertain origin, probably from a Scandinavian source akin to Old
Norse ski&eth; stick of wood (see ski (n.)). As a sliding along from 1890; specifically of motor
vehicles from 1903. Skid-mark is from 1914.    In the timber regions of the American West, skids
laid down one after another to form a road were a poor thing for pleasure walks, but admirably
adapted for hauling logs on the ground with a minimum of friction [Out West magazine, October 1903].
A skid as something used to facilitate downhill motion led to figurative phrases such as hit the
skids go into rapid decline (1909), and see skid row.
