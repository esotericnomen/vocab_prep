anathema (n.)

1520s, an accursed thing, from Latin anathema an excommunicated person; the curse of
excommunication, from Greek anathema a thing accursed, originally a thing devoted, literally a thing
set up (to the gods), from ana- up (see ana-) + tithenai to put, place (see theme).    Originally
simply a votive offering, by the time it reached Latin the meaning had progressed through thing
devoted to evil, to thing accursed or damned. Later applied to persons and the Divine Curse. Meaning
formal act or formula of consigning to damnation is from 1610s.   Anathema maranatha, taken as an
intensified form, is a misreading of the Syriac maran etha the Lord hath come, which follows
anathema in I Cor. xvi:22, but is not connected with it (see Maranatha).
