1520s, an accursed thing, from Latin anathema an excommunicated person; the curse of
excommunication, from Greek anathema a thing accursed, originally a thing devoted, literally a thing
set up (to the gods), from ana- up (see <a href=/index.php?term=ana-&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>ana-</a>) + tithenai to put, place (see <a
href=/index.php?term=theme&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>theme</a>).  <br /><br />
Originally simply a votive offering, by the time it reached Latin the meaning had progressed through
thing devoted to evil, to thing accursed or damned. Later applied to persons and the Divine Curse.
Meaning formal act or formula of consigning to damnation is from 1610s.  <br /><br /> Anathema
maranatha, taken as an intensified form, is a misreading of the Syriac maran etha the Lord hath
come, which follows anathema in I Cor. xvi:22, but is not connected with it (see <a
