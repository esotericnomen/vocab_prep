anathema (n.)

1520s, an accursed thing, from Latin anathema an excommunicated person; the curse of
excommunication, from Greek anathema a thing accursed, originally a thing devoted, literally a thing
set up (to the gods), from ana- up (see ana-) + tithenai to put, place (see theme).    Originally
simply a votive offering, by the time it reached Latin the meaning had progressed through thing
devoted to evil, to thing accursed or damned. Later applied to persons and the Divine Curse. Meaning
formal act or formula of consigning to damnation is from 1610s.   Anathema maranatha, taken as an
intensified form, is a misreading of the Syriac maran etha the Lord hath come, which follows
anathema in I Cor. xvi:22, but is not connected with it (see Maranatha).


anathematize (v.)

to pronounce an anathema against, 1560s, from French anath&eacute;matiser (Old French anatemer),
from Latin anathematizare, from Greek anathematizein to devote (to evil), from stem of anathema.
Alternative anathemize (1670s) is less correct and more rare. Related: Anathematized;
anathematizing.


Maranatha

late 14c., a Bible word, from Greek maranatha, untranslated Semitic word in I Cor. xvi:22, where it
follows Greek anathema, and therefore has been taken as part of a phrase and used as a curse.
Usually assumed to be from Aramaic maran atha Our Lord has come, which would make the common usage
erroneous (see OED entry), but possibly it is a false transliteration of Hebrew mohoram atta you are
put under the ban, which would make more sense in the context. [Klein]
