cunning, deceitful, unscrupulous, 1570s, from Niccolo Machiavelli (1469-1527), Florentine statesman
and author of Del Principe, a work advising rulers to place advantage above morality. A word of
abuse in English well before his works were translated (The Discourses 1636, The Prince 1640), in
part because his books were Indexed by the Church, in part because of French attacks on him (such as
Gentillet's, translated into English 1602).
