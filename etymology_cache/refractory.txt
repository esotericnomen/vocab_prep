refractory (adj.)

stubborn, obstinate, perverse, 1610s (earlier refractorious, 1550s, refractary, c.1600), from Latin
refractarius obstinate, stubborn, from past participle stem of refringere (see refraction). Related:
Refractorily; refractoriness.


frog march

also frog-march, 1871, a term that originated among London police and referred to their method of
moving a drunken or refractory prisoner by carrying him face-down between four people, each holding
a limb; the connection with frog (n.1) perhaps being the notion of going along belly-down. By the
1930s, the verb was used in reference to the much more efficient (but less frog-like) method of
getting someone in an arm-behind-the-back hold and hustling him or her along like that.
