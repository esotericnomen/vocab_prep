skirmish (n.)

late 14c., from Old French escarmouche skirmish, from Italian scaramuccia, earlier schermugio,
probably from a Germanic source (compare Old High German skirmen to protect, defend), with a
diminutive or depreciatory suffix, from Proto-Germanic *skerm-, from PIE *(s)ker- (1) to cut (see
shear (v.)).    Influenced in Middle English by a separate verb skirmysshen to brandish a weapon,
from Old French eskirmiss-, stem of eskirmir to fence, from Frankish *skirmjan, from the same
Germanic source. Compare scrimmage. Other modern Germanic forms have an additional diminutive affix:
German scharm&#252;tzel, Dutch schermutseling, Danish skj&#230;rmydsel. Skirmish-line attested by
1864.
