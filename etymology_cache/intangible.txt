intangible (adj.)

ragtime (n.)

also rag-time, syncopated, jazzy piano music, 1897, perhaps from rag dance ball (1895, American
English dialect), or a shortening of ragged, in reference to the syncopated melody. Rag (n.) ragtime
dance tune is from 1899.    If rag-time was called tempo di raga or rague-temps it might win honor
more speedily. ... What the derivation of the word is[,] I have not the faintest idea. The negroes
call their clog-dancing ragging and the dance a rag. [Rupert Hughes, Boston Musical Record, April
1900]   <hr />   Conceive the futility of trying to reduce the intangible ragness to a strict system
of misbegotten grace notes and untimely rests! In attempting to perfect, and simplify, art is
destroying the unhampered spirit in which consists the whole beauty of rag-time music. The very
essence of rag-time is that it shall lack all art, depending for the spirit to be infused more upon
the performer than upon the composer himself. [Yale Literary Magazine, June, 1899]   <hr />   Her
first rag-time was The Bully, in which she made great sport by bringing a little coloured boy on the
stage with her. Miss [May] Irwin says the way to learn to sing rag-time is to catch a negro and
study him. [Lewis C. Strang, Famous Actresses of the Day in America, Boston, 1899]
