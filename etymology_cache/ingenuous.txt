frank, upright, candid, originally native, freeborn, from in- in (see in- (2)) + gen-, root of

ingenuity (n.)

1590s, honor, nobility, from Middle French ing&eacute;nuit&eacute; and directly from Latin
ingenuitatem (nominative ingenuitas) condition of a free-born man, figuratively generosity, noble-
mindedness, from ingenuus (see ingenuous). Etymologically, this word belongs to ingenuous, but in
17c. ingenious and ingenuous so often were confused (even by Shakespeare) that ingenuity has
acquired the meaning capacity for invention or construction (first attested 1640s).


ingenue (n.)

1848, from French ing&eacute;nue artless girl, especially on the stage, fem. of ing&eacute;nu

is recorded from 1660s.


unmerited (adj.)

1640s, from un- (1) not + past participle of merit (v.).    An ingenuous mind feels in unmerited
praise the bitterest reproof. If you reject it you are unhappy, if you accept it you are undone.
[Walter Savage Landor, Imaginary Conversations]


artless (adj.)

1580s, unskillful, from art (n.) + -less. Later also uncultured (1590s); then unartificial, natural
(1670s) and guileless, ingenuous (1714). Related: Artlessly; artlessness.
