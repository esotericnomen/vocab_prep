oblivious (adj.)

mid-15c., from Latin obliviosus forgetful, that easily forgets; producing forgetfulness, from
oblivion (see oblivion). Meaning unaware, unconscious (of something) is from 1862, formerly regarded
as erroneous, this is now the general meaning and the word has lost its original sense of no longer
aware or mindful. Properly should be used with to, not of. Related: Obliviously; obliviousness.
