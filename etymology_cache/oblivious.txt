mid-15c., from Latin obliviosus forgetful, that easily forgets; producing forgetfulness, from
oblivion (see <a href=/index.php?term=oblivion&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>oblivion</a>). Meaning unaware, unconscious (of something) is from 1862,
formerly regarded as erroneous, this is now the general meaning and the word has lost its original
sense of no longer aware or mindful. Properly should be used with to, not of. Related: Obliviously;
obliviousness.
