one of the most etymologically complex of English place names, it illustrates the changes wrought in
Old English words by Anglo-French scribes who could not pronounce them. Recorded 1016 as
Scrobbesbyrig, it originally may have meant the fortified place in (a district called) The Scrub.
The initial consonant cluster was impossible for the scribes, who simplified it to sr-, then added a
vowel (sar-) to make it easier still.  <br /><br />  The name was also changed by Anglo-French loss
or metathesis of liquids in words containing -l-, -n-, or -r- (also evident in the derivatives of
Old French Berengier bear-spear -- Old High German Beringar -- name of one of the paladins in the
Charlemagne romances and a common given name in England 12c. and 13c., which has come down in
surnames as Berringer, Bellanger, Benger, etc.). Thus Sarop- became Salop- and in the 12c. and 13c.
the overwhelming spelling in government records was Salopesberie, which accounts for the
abbreviation Salop for the modern county.  <br /><br />  During all this, the Anglo-Saxon
inhabitants (as opposed to the French scribes) still pronounced it properly, and regular sound
evolutions probably produced a pronunciation something like Shrobesbury (which turns up on a 1327
patent roll). After a predictable -b- to -v- (a vowel in the Middle Ages) to -u- shift, the modern
spelling begins to emerge 14c. and is fully established 15c.  <br /><br /> Shrewsbury clock, for
some reason, became proverbial for exactness, and thus, naturally, proverbial as indicating
exaggeration of accuracy (1590s).
