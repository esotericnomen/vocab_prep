peer (n.)

c.1300, an equal in rank or status (early 13c. in Anglo-Latin), from Anglo-French peir, Old French
per (10c.), from Latin par equal (see par (n.)). Sense of a noble (late 14c.) is from Charlemagne's
Twelve Peers in the old romances, who, like the Arthurian knights of the Round Table, originally
were so called because all were equal. Sociological sense of one of the same age group or social set
is from 1944. Peer review attested by 1970. Peer pressure is first recorded 1971.
