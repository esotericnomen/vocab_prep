philistine (n.)

person deficient in liberal culture, 1827, originally in Carlyle, popularized by him and Matthew
Arnold, from German Philister enemy of God's word, literally Philistine, inhabitants of a Biblical
land, neighbors (and enemies) of Israel (see Philistine). Popularized in German student slang
(supposedly first in Jena, late 17c.) as a contemptuous term for townies, and hence, by extension,
any uncultured person. Philistine had been used in a humorous figurative sense of the enemy in
English from c.1600.
