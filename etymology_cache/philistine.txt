philistine (n.)

person deficient in liberal culture, 1827, originally in Carlyle, popularized by him and Matthew
Arnold, from German Philister enemy of God's word, literally Philistine, inhabitants of a Biblical
land, neighbors (and enemies) of Israel (see Philistine). Popularized in German student slang
(supposedly first in Jena, late 17c.) as a contemptuous term for townies, and hence, by extension,
any uncultured person. Philistine had been used in a humorous figurative sense of the enemy in
English from c.1600.

Beelzebub

Old English Belzebub, Philistine god worshipped at Ekron (2 Kings i:2), from Latin, used in Vulgate
for New Testament Greek beelzeboub, from Hebrew ba'al-z'bub lord of the flies, from ba'al lord (see
Baal) + z'bhubh fly. By later Christian writers often taken as another name for Satan, though Milton
made him one of the fallen angels. Baal being originally a title, it was applied by the Hebrews to
neighboring divinities based on their attributes; other examples include Baal-berith the covenant
lord, god of the Shechemites; Baal-peor lord of the opening, a god of Moab and Midian.
