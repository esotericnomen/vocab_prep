Uranus

first planet discovered that was not known in ancient times, named for the god of Heaven, husband of
Gaia, the Earth, from Latin Uranus, from Greek Ouranos literally heaven, the sky; in Greek
cosmology, the god who personifies the heavens, father of the titans.    The planet was discovered
and identified as such in 1781 by Sir William Herschel (it had been observed before, but mistaken
for a star; in 1690 John Flamsteed cataloged it as 34 Tauri); Herschel proposed calling it Georgium
Sidus, literally George's Star, in honour of his patron, King George III of England.  I cannot but
wish to take this opportunity of expressing my sense of gratitude, by giving the name of Georgium
Sidus ... to a star which (with respect to us) first began to shine under His auspicious reign. [Sir
William Herschel, 1783]  The planet was known in English in 1780s as the Georgian Planet; French
astronomers began calling Herschel, and ultimately German astronomer Johann Bode proposed Uranus as
in conformity with other planet names. However, the name didn't come into common usage until c.1850.
