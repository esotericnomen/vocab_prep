phobia (n.)

irrational fear, horror, aversion, 1786, perhaps on model of similar use in French, abstracted from
compounds in -phobia, from Greek -phobia, from phobos fear, panic fear, terror, outward show of
fear; object of fear or terror, originally flight (still the only sense in Homer), but it became the
common word for fear via the notion of panic, fright (compare phobein put to flight, frighten), from
PIE root *bhegw- to run (cognates: Lithuanian begu to flee; Old Church Slavonic begu flight, bezati
to flee, run; Old Norse bekkr a stream). Psychological sense attested by 1895.
