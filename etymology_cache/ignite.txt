cap (n.)

late Old English c&aelig;ppe hood, head-covering, cape, from Late Latin cappa a cape, hooded cloak

transferred to hood of a cloak, then to cloak itself, though the various senses co-existed. Old
English took in two forms of the Late Latin word, one meaning head-covering, the other
ecclesiastical dress (see cape (n.1)). In most Romance languages, a diminutive of Late Latin cappa
has become the usual word for head-covering (such as French chapeau).
