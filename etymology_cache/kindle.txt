kindle (v.)

c.1200, cundel, to set fire to, to start on fire, probably from a Scandinavian source akin to Old
Norse kynda to kindle, to light a fire, Swedish quindla kindle, of uncertain origin, + frequentative
suffix -le. Figurative use from c.1300. Intransitive sense to begin to burn, to catch fire is from
c.1400. Related: Kindled; kindling.    Influenced in form, and sometimes in Middle English in sense,
with kindel to give birth (of animals), bring forth, produce (c.1200), from kindel (n.) offspring of
an animal, young one, from Old English gecynd (see kind (n.)) + -el.
