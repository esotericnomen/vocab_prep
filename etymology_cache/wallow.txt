wallow (v.)

Old English wealwian to roll, from West Germanic *walwon, from PIE root *wel- (3) to roll (see
volvox). Figurative sense of to plunge and remain in some state or condition is attested from early
13c. Related: Wallowed; wallowing. The noun is recorded from 1590s as act of rolling; 1841 as place
where an animal wallows.


soil (v.)

early 13c., to defile or pollute with sin, from Old French soillier to splatter with mud, to foul or
make dirty, originally to wallow (12c., Modern French souillier), from souil tub, wild boar's
wallow, pigsty, which is from either Latin solium tub for bathing; seat, or Latin suculus little
pig, from sus pig. Literal meaning to make dirty, begrime is attested from c.1300 in English.
Related: Soiled; soiling.


bask (v.)

late 14c., basken to wallow (in blood), with loss of middle syllable, from Old Norse ba&eth;ask to
bathe oneself, reflexive of ba&eth;a bathe (see bathe). Modern meaning soak up a flood of warmth is
apparently due to Shakespeare's use of the word in reference to sunshine in As You Like It (1600).
Related: Basked; basking.
