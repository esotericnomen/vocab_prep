limbo (n.1)

region supposed to exist on the border of Hell reserved for pre-Christian saints (Limbus patrum) and
unbaptized infants (Limbus infantum); c.1300, from Latin limbo, ablative of limbus edge, border (see
limb (2)). It emerged from Latin in the ablative form from frequent use in phrases such as in limbo
(patrum), etc. Figurative sense of condition of neglect or oblivion is from 1640s.
