limbo (n.1)

region supposed to exist on the border of Hell reserved for pre-Christian saints (Limbus patrum) and
unbaptized infants (Limbus infantum); c.1300, from Latin limbo, ablative of limbus edge, border (see
limb (2)). It emerged from Latin in the ablative form from frequent use in phrases such as in limbo
(patrum), etc. Figurative sense of condition of neglect or oblivion is from 1640s.


limbo (n.2)

dance in which the dancer bends backward and passes under a bar, 1956, of W.Indian origin, probably
an alteration of limber.


limbus (n.)

Latin, literally edge, border (see limb (n.2)). In Medieval Latin, region on the border of Hell, and
thus sometimes used in English for limbo (n.1).


demi-monde (n.)

1855, also demimonde, from French demi-monde so-so society, literally half-world, from demi- half +
monde, from Latin mundus world (see mundane).    Popularized by use as title of a comedy by
Alexandre Dumas fils (1824-1895). Dumas' Demi-Monde is the link between good and bad society ... the
world of compromised women, a social limbo, the inmates of which ... are perpetually struggling to
emerge into the paradise of honest and respectable ladies [Fraser's Magazine, 1855]. Not properly
used of courtesans. Compare 18th-century English demi-rep (1749, the second element short for
reputation), defined as a woman that intrigues with every man she likes, under the name and
appearance of virtue ... in short, whom every body knows to be what no body calls her [Fielding].
