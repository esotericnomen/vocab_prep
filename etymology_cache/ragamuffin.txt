ragamuffin (n.)

mid-14c., demon, also in surnames (Isabella Ragamuffyn, 1344), from Middle English raggi ragged

Ragamoffyn, name of a demon in a mystery play. Sense of dirty, disreputable boy is from 1580s.
Compare in the same sense ragabash (c.1600).

1897, from German Lumpenproletariat (1850), from Karl Marx, who coined it to mean rabble, poorest of

average is that it is from German dialectal (Bavarian) Huddellump ragamuffin [Barnhart].    What the
