mid-14c., demon, also in surnames (Isabella Ragamuffyn, 1344), from Middle English raggi ragged
(rag-y?) + fanciful ending (or else second element is Middle Dutch muffe mitten). Or, as Johnson has

class=crossreference>Ragged</a> was used of the devil from c.1300 in reference to shaggy appearance.
Raggeman was used by Langland as the name of a demon, and compare Old French Ragamoffyn, name of a
demon in a mystery play. Sense of dirty, disreputable boy is from 1580s. Compare in the same sense
ragabash (c.1600).
