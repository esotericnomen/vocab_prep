ragamuffin (n.)

mid-14c., demon, also in surnames (Isabella Ragamuffyn, 1344), from Middle English raggi ragged
(rag-y?) + fanciful ending (or else second element is Middle Dutch muffe mitten). Or, as Johnson has
it, From rag and I know not what else. Ragged was used of the devil from c.1300 in reference to
shaggy appearance. Raggeman was used by Langland as the name of a demon, and compare Old French
Ragamoffyn, name of a demon in a mystery play. Sense of dirty, disreputable boy is from 1580s.
Compare in the same sense ragabash (c.1600).
