proviso (n.)

mid-15c., from Medieval Latin proviso (quod) provided (that), phrase at the beginning of clauses in
legal documents (mid-14c.), from Latin proviso it being provided, ablative neuter of provisus, past
participle of providere (see provide). Related: Provisory.


clause (n.)

c.1200, a sentence, a brief statement, a short passage, from Old French clause stipulation (in a
legal document), 12c., from Medieval Latin clausa conclusion, used in the sense of classical Latin
clausula the end, a closing, termination, also end of a sentence or a legal argument, from clausa,
fem. noun from past participle of claudere to close, to shut, to conclude (see close (v.)).
Grammatical sense is from c.1300. Legal meaning distinct condition, stipulation, or proviso is
recorded from late 14c. in English. The sense of ending seems to have fallen from the word between
Latin and French.
