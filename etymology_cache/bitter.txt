In lexicons of sea language going back to 1759, the bitter end is the part of a cable which is round
about the bits (two great timbers used to belay cables) when the ship is at anchor.  <blockquote>
Bitter end of the Cable, the End which is wound about the Bitts. [The News-Readers Pocket-Book: Or,
a Military Dictionary, London, 1759]  </blockquote>  See <a

is played out to the bitter end, there is no more left to play. The term began to be used c.1835 in
non-nautical use and with probable influence of <a
