Old English forst, frost a freezing, becoming frozen, extreme cold, from Proto-Germanic *frusta-
(cognates: Old Saxon, Old Frisian, Old High German frost, Middle Dutch and Dutch vorst), related to
freosan to freeze, from PIE *preus- to freeze; burn (see <a
href=/index.php?term=freeze&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>freeze</a> (v.)). Both forms
of the word were common in English till late 15c.; the triumph of frost may be due to its similarity
to the forms in other Germanic languages.
