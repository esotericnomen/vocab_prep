frost (n.)

Old English forst, frost a freezing, becoming frozen, extreme cold, from Proto-Germanic *frusta-
(cognates: Old Saxon, Old Frisian, Old High German frost, Middle Dutch and Dutch vorst), related to
freosan to freeze, from PIE *preus- to freeze; burn (see freeze (v.)). Both forms of the word were
common in English till late 15c.; the triumph of frost may be due to its similarity to the forms in
other Germanic languages.
