simpering (adj.)

1580s, present participle adjective from simper (v.). Related: Simperingly.


simper (v.)

1560s, to smile in an affected and silly way, perhaps from a Scandinavian source (such as dialectal
Danish semper affected, coy, prudish) or Middle Dutch zimperlijk affected, coy, prim, of unknown
origin. Related: Simpered; simpering. As a noun, 1590s, from the verb.


simmer (v.)

1650s, alteration of simperen to simmer (late 15c.), possibly imitative; not thought to be connected
to simper (v.). OED says the change is probably due to a feeling of phonetic appropriateness.
Figurative sense, of feelings, to be agitated is from 1764. Opposite sense, in simmer down, first
recorded 1871, probably from the notion of moving from a full boil to a mere simmer.    I must and
will keep shady and quiet till Bret Harte simmers down a little. [Mark Twain, letter, 1871]
Related: Simmered; simmering. The noun meaning a condition of simmering is from 1809.


smile (v.)

c.1300, perhaps from Middle Low German *smilen or a Scandinavian source (such as Danish smile smile,
Swedish smila smile, smirk, simper, fawn), from Proto-Germanic *smil-, extended form of PIE root
*smei- to laugh, smile (cognates: Old English smerian to laugh at, scorn, Old High German smieron to
smile, Latin mirus wonderful, mirari to wonder). Related: Smiled; smiling.     Gradually pushed the
usual Old English word, smearcian (modern smirk), into a specific, unpleasant sense. Of the eyes,
from 1759. Figuratively, as indicating favor or encouragement, from c.1400. Romance, Celtic, and
Slavic languages tend to use a diminutive of the word for laugh to mean smile (such as Latin ridere
laugh; subridere smile), perhaps literally small laugh or low laugh.
