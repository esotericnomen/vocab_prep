abhorrent (adj.)

1610s, in a position or condition to recoil, usually with from; from Latin abhorentem (nominative
abhorrens), present participle of abhorrere; see abhor. Meaning repugnant is from 1650s. Earlier was
abhorrable (late 15c.).


abhor (v.)

mid-15c., from Latin abhorrere shrink back from, have an aversion for, shudder at, from ab- away
(see ab-) + horrere tremble at, shudder, literally to bristle, be shaggy, from PIE *ghers- start
out, stand out, rise to a point, bristle (see horror). Related: Abhorred; abhorring.


orotund (adj.)

1792, from Latin ore rotundo in well-rounded phrases, literally with round mouth (see ore rotundo).
The odd thing about the word is that its only currency, at least in its non-technical sense, is
among those who should most abhor it, the people of sufficient education to realize its bad
formation; it is at once a monstrosity in its form &amp; a pedantry in its use. [Fowler]


shun (v.)

Old English scunian to shun, avoid; abhor; desist, abstain; to hide, seek safety by concealment, of
uncertain origin; not found in any other language. Perhaps ultimately from PIE root *skeu- to cover,
to hide. Related: Shunned; shunning. A shun-pike (American English, 1911) was a road constructed to
avoid tolls.


detest (v.)

early 15c., to curse, to call God to witness and abhor, from Middle French d&eacute;tester, from
Latin detestari to curse, execrate, abominate, express abhorrence for, literally denounce with one's
testimony, from de- from, down (see de-) + testari be a witness, from testis witness (see
testament). Related: Detested; detesting.


execrate (v.)

1560s, from Latin execratus/exsecratus, past participle of execrari/exsecrari to curse, utter a
curse; hate, abhor, from ex- (see ex-) + sacrare to devote to (see sacred). Hence, to devote off or
away; to curse. Related: Execrated; execrating.
