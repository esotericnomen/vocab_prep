reek (n.)

Old English rec (Anglian), riec (West Saxon), smoke from burning material, probably from a
Scandinavian source such as Old Norse reykr, Danish r&#511;g, Swedish r&#246;k smoke, steam,  from
Proto-Germanic *raukiz (cognates: Old Frisian rek, Middle Dutch rooc, Old High German rouh, German
Rauch smoke, steam), from PIE *reug- to vomit, belch; also smoke, cloud. Sense of stench is attested
1650s, via the notion of that which rises (compare reek (v.)).
