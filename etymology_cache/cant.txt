insincere talk, 1709, earlier it was slang for whining of beggars (1640s), from the verb in this
sense (1560s), from Old North French canter (Old French chanter) to sing, chant, from Latin cantare,
frequentative of canere to sing (see <a href=/index.php?term=chant&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>chant</a> (v.)). Sense in English developed after 1680 to mean the jargon of
criminals and vagabonds, thence applied contemptuously by any sect or school to the phraseology of
its rival.  <blockquote>  ... Slang is universal, whilst Cant is restricted in usage to certain
classes of the community: thieves, vagrom men, and -- well, their associates. ... Slang boasts a
quasi-respectability denied to Cant, though Cant is frequently more enduring, its use continuing
without variation of meaning for many generations. [John S. Farmer, Forewords to Musa Pedestris,
1896]  </blockquote>
