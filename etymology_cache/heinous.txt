heinous (adj.)

late 14c., from Old French hainos inconvenient, awkward; hateful, unpleasant; odious (Modern French
haineux), from haine hatred, from hair to hate, from Frankish, from Proto-Germanic *hatjan, related
to *haton (see hate (v.)). Related: Heinously; heinousness.


nefandous (adj.)

not to be spoken of, 1630s, from Latin nefandous unmentionable, impious, heinous, from ne-, negative
particle, + fandus to be spoken, gerundive of fari (see fame (n.)).


enormity (n.)

late 15c., transgression, crime, irregularity, from Old French &eacute;normit&eacute; extravagance,
enormity, atrocity, heinous sin, from Latin enormitatem (nominative enormitas) hugeness, vastness,
irregularity, from enormis (see enormous). Meaning extreme wickedness in English attested from
1560s; sense of hugeness (1792) is etymological but probably best avoided to prevent
misunderstanding.


murder (n.)

c.1300, murdre, from Old English mor&eth;or (plural mor&thorn;ras) secret killing of a person,
unlawful killing, also mortal sin, crime; punishment, torment, misery, from Proto-Germanic *murthra-
(cognates: Goth maur&thorn;r, and, from a variant form of the same root, Old Saxon morth, Old
Frisian morth, Old Norse mor&eth;, Middle Dutch moort, Dutch moord, German Mord murder), from PIE
*mrtro-, from root *mer- to die (see mortal (adj.)). The spelling with -d- probably reflects
influence of Anglo-French murdre, from Old French mordre, from Medieval Latin murdrum, from the
Germanic root.    Viking custom, typical of Germanic, distinguished mor&eth; (Old Norse) secret
slaughter, from vig (Old Norse) slaying. The former involved concealment, or slaying a man by night
or when asleep, and was a heinous crime. The latter was not a disgrace, if the killer acknowledged
his deed, but he was subject to vengeance or demand for compensation.Mordre wol out that se we day
by day. [Chaucer, Nun's Priest's Tale, c.1386]Weakened sense of very unpleasant situation is from
1878.
