mammoth (n.)

1706, from Russian mammot', probably from Ostyak, a Finno-Ugric language of northern Russia (compare
Finnish maa earth). Because the remains were dug from the earth, the animal was believed to root
like a mole. As an adjective, gigantic, from 1802; in this sense the word appears to be originally
American [Thornton, American Glossary], and its first uses are in derogatory accounts to the cheese
wheel, more than 4 feet in diameter, sent to President Jefferson by the ladies of the Baptist
congregation in Cheshire, Mass., as a present, engraved with the motto Rebellion to tyrants is
obedience to God. Federalist editors mocked the affair, and called up the word mammoth (known from
Peale's exhibition) to characterize it.
