serendipity (n.)

1754 (but rare before 20c.), coined by Horace Walpole (1717-92) in a letter to Horace Mann (dated
Jan. 28); he said he formed it from the Persian fairy tale The Three Princes of Serendip, whose
heroes were always making discoveries, by accidents and sagacity, of things they were not in quest
of. The name is from Serendip, an old name for Ceylon (modern Sri Lanka), from Arabic Sarandib, from
Sanskrit Simhaladvipa Dwelling-Place-of-Lions Island.
