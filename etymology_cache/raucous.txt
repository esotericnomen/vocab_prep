raucous (adj.)

1769, from Latin raucus hoarse (also source of French rauque, Spanish ronco, Italian rauco), related
to ravus hoarse, from PIE echoic base *reu- make hoarse cries (cognates: Sanskrit rayati barks,
ravati roars; Greek oryesthai to howl, roar; Latin racco a roar; Old Church Slavonic rjevo I roar;
Lithuanian rekti roar; Old English rarian to wail, bellow). Middle English had rauc in the same
sense, from the same source.


rook (n.1)

European crow, Old English hroc, from Proto-Germanic *khrokaz (cognates: Old Norse hrokr, Middle
Dutch roec, Dutch roek, Middle Swedish roka, Old High German hruoh crow), possibly imitative of its
raucous voice (compare Gaelic roc croak, Sanskrit kruc to cry out). Used as a disparaging term for
persons since at least c.1500, and extended by 1570s to mean a cheat, especially at cards or dice.


cantankerous (adj.)

1772, said to be a Wiltshire word, probably from an alteration (influenced by raucous) of Middle
English contakour troublemaker (c.1300), from Anglo-French contec discord, strife, from Old French
contechier (Old North French contekier), from con- with + teche, related to atachier hold fast (see
attach). With -ous. Related: Cantankerously; cantankerousness.
