doze (v.)

1640s, probably from a Scandinavian source (compare Old Norse dusa to doze, Danish d&oslash;se to
make dull, Swedish dialectal dusa to sleep); related to Old English dysig foolish (see dizzy). May
have existed in dialect earlier than attested date. Related: Dozed; dozing. As a noun, from 1731.
