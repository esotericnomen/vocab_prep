late 14c., flow of rhythm in verse or music, from Middle French cadence, from Old Italian cadenza
conclusion of a movement in music, literally a falling, from Vulgar Latin *cadentia, from neuter
plural of Latin cadens, present participle of cadere to fall (see <a
href=/index.php?term=case&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>case</a> (n.1)). In 16c.,
sometimes used literally for an act of falling. A doublet of <a
