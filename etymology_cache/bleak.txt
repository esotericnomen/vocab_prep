c.1300, pale, from Old Norse bleikr pale, whitish, blond, from Proto-Germanic *blaika- shining,
white, from PIE root *bhel- (1) to shine, flash, burn (see <a
href=/index.php?term=bleach&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>bleach</a> (v.)). Later
bare, windswept (1530s). Sense of cheerless is c.1719 figurative extension. The same Germanic root
produced Old English blac pale, but this died out, probably from confusion with bl&aelig;c black;
however bleak persisted, with a sense of bare as well as pale.
