bleak (adj.)

c.1300, pale, from Old Norse bleikr pale, whitish, blond, from Proto-Germanic *blaika- shining,
white, from PIE root *bhel- (1) to shine, flash, burn (see bleach (v.)). Later bare, windswept
(1530s). Sense of cheerless is c.1719 figurative extension. The same Germanic root produced Old
English blac pale, but this died out, probably from confusion with bl&aelig;c black; however bleak
persisted, with a sense of bare as well as pale.
