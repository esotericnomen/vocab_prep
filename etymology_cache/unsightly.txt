unsightly (adj.)

1540s, displeasing to the eye, from un- (1) not + sight (n.) + -ly (1). Similar formation in Middle
Dutch onsichtlijc invisible; ugly, Middle High German unsihtlih invisible. Related: Unsightliness.
Middle English sightlie is attested from mid-15c. but only in the sense visible; unsightly is
attested in Middle English only as an adverb meaning invisibly (late 15c.). Sightly as pleasing to
the eye is from 1560s. Middle English also had unsighty difficult or displeasing to look at (early
15c., from sighty attractive, late 14c.), also unsightily in the same sense (c.1400).


indecorous (adj.)

1670s, from Latin indecorus unbecoming, unseemly, unsightly, from in- not, opposite of, without (see
in- (1)) + decorus becoming, fitting, seemly, proper (see decorous). Related: Indecorously;
indecorousness.


turpitude (n.)

depravity, infamy, late 15c., from Middle French turpitude (early 15c.), from Latin turpitudinem
(nominative turpitudo) baseness, from turpis vile, physically ugly, base, unsightly, figuratively
morally ugly, scandalous, shameful, of unknown origin. Klein suggests perhaps originally what one
turns away from (compare Latin trepit he turns).


bent (n.2)

stiff grass, Old English beonet, from West Germanic *binut- rush, marsh grass (cognates: Old Saxon
binet, Old High German binuz, German Binse rush, reed), of unknown origin. An obsolete word, but
surviving in place names (such as Bentley, from Old English Beonet-leah; Bentham).    The verdure of
the plain lies buried deep  Beneath the dazzling deluge; and the bents,  And coarser grass,
upspearing o'er the rest,  Of late unsightly and unseen, now shine  Conspicuous, and, in bright
apparel clad  And fledg'd with icy feathers, nod superb.    [Cowper, The Winter-Morning Walk, from
The Task]
