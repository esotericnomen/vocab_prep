unsightly (adj.)

1540s, displeasing to the eye, from un- (1) not + sight (n.) + -ly (1). Similar formation in Middle
Dutch onsichtlijc invisible; ugly, Middle High German unsihtlih invisible. Related: Unsightliness.
Middle English sightlie is attested from mid-15c. but only in the sense visible; unsightly is
attested in Middle English only as an adverb meaning invisibly (late 15c.). Sightly as pleasing to
the eye is from 1560s. Middle English also had unsighty difficult or displeasing to look at (early
15c., from sighty attractive, late 14c.), also unsightily in the same sense (c.1400).
