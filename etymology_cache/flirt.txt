1550s, originally to turn up one's nose, sneer at, then to rap or flick, as with the fingers
(1560s). The noun is first attested 1540s, from the verb, with the meaning stroke of wit. It's
possible that the original word was imitative, along the lines of <a

to be some influence from <a href=/index.php?term=flit&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>flit</a>, such as in the flirt sense of to move in short, quick flights,
attested from 1580s.  <br /><br />  Meanwhile flirt (n.) had come to mean a pert young hussey
[Johnson] by 1560s, and Shakespeare has flirt-gill (i.e. Jill) a woman of light or loose behavior,
while flirtgig was a 17c. Yorkshire dialect word for a giddy, flighty girl. All or any of these
could have fed into the main modern verbal sense of play at courtship (1777), which also could have
grown naturally from the earlier meaning to flit inconstantly from object to object (1570s), perhaps
influenced by Old French fleureter talk sweet nonsense, also to touch a thing in passing, diminutive
of fleur flower and metaphoric of bees skimming from flower to flower.  <br /><br />  The noun
meaning person who flirts is from 1732. The English word also is possibly related to East Frisian
flirt a flick or light blow, and flirtje a giddy girl. French flirter to flirt is a 19c. borrowing
from English. Related: Flirted; flirting.
