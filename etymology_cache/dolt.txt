Middle English dullen to dull, make or become dazed or stupid (see dull (adj.)). Related: Doltish;
doltishly; doltishness.

U.S., black person, from 1856.


dummy (n.)

1590s, mute person, from dumb (adj.) + -y (3). Extended by 1845 to figure representing a person.

student slang, dolt, idiot, nerd, by 1960s. Dictionary of American Slang says probably related to

asinine (adj.)

c.1600, obstinate, stupid, from Latin asininus stupid, literally like an ass, from asinus ass, also
dolt, blockhead (see ass (n.1)). The literal sense in English is recorded from 1620s.

bambino (n.)

little child, 1761, from Italian bambino, baby, a diminutive of bambo simple (compare Latin bambalio
dolt, Greek bambainein to stammer). In U.S. baseball lore, a nickname of George Herman Babe Ruth Jr.
(1895-1948).


chubby (adj.)

1610s, literally resembling a chub, from chub, the short, thick type of fish + -y (2). Perhaps
influenced by Old Norse kumba log, kumben stumpy.    ME chubbe ... was also used of a lazy,
spiritless fellow; a rustic, simpleton; dolt, fool (1558), whilst Bailey has Chub, a Jolt-head, a
great-headed, full-cheeked Fellow, a description reminiscent of that of the chevin, another name for
the chub ... Thus the nickname may have meant either short and thick, dumpy like a chub, or of the
nature of a chub, dull and clownish. [Dictionary of English Surnames]


cull (n.)

dupe, saphead, rogues' slang from late 16c., perhaps a shortening of cullion base fellow, originally
testicle (from French couillon, from Old French coillon testicle; worthless fellow, dolt, from Latin
coleus, literally strainer bag; see cojones), though another theory traces it to Romany (Gypsy)
chulai man. Also sometimes cully, though some authorities assert cully was the canting term for dupe
and cull was generic man, fellow, without implication of gullibility. Compare also gullible.
