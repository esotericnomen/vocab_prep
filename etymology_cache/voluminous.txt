voluminous (adj.)

1610s, forming a large mass, also full of turnings and windings, from Late Latin voluminosus, from
Latin volumen (genitive voluminis) volume (see volume). Related: Voluminously; voluminousness.


loaf (v.)

1835, American English, back-formation from loafer (1830). Related: Loafed; loafing.    The term
loafing is, of course, very vague. Its meaning, like that of its opposite, work, depends largely on
the user. The highly successful quarterback with an E in Greek is a loafer in his professor's eyes,
while the idea of the professor's working, in spite of his voluminous researches on Mycenean Table
Manners, would excite hoots of derision from the laborer that lays the drains before his study
window. [Yale Literary Magazine, May 1908]
