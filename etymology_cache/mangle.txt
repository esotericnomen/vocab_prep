mangle (v.)

to mutilate, c.1400, from Anglo-French mangler, frequentative of Old French mangoner cut to pieces,

maim). Meaning to mispronounce (words), garble is from 1530s. Related: Mangled; mangling.


mangrove (n.)

1610s, mangrow, probably from Spanish mangle, mangue (1530s), which is perhaps from Carib or
Arawakan. Modern spelling in English (1690s) is from influence of grove. A Malay origin also has
been proposed, but it is difficult to explain how it came to be used for an American plant.

club, heavy hammer (see maul (n.). The meaning damage seriously, mangle is first recorded 1690s.

higgledy-piggledy

confusedly, hurriedly, 1590s, a vocal gesture [OED] probably formed from pig and the animal's
suggestions of mess and disorder. Reduplications in the h-/p- pattern are common (as in hanky-panky,
hocus-pocus, hinch(y)-pinch(y), an obsolete children's game, attested from c.1600).    Edward Moor,
Suffolk Words and Phrases (London, 1823), quotes a list of reduplications from Ray's Collection of
English Words (1768), all said to signify any confusion or mixture; the list has higgledy-piggledy,
hurly-burly, hodge-podge, mingle-mangle, arsy-versy, kim-kam, hub-bub, crawly-mauly, and hab-nab. To
which he might have added, Moor writes, crincum-crankum, crinkle-crankle, flim-flam, fiddle-faddle,
gibble-gabble, harum-scarum, helter-skelter, hiccup-suickup, hocus-pocus, hotch-potch, hugger-
mugger, hum-drum, hum-strum, hurry-scurry, jibber-jabber, prittle-prattle, shilly-shally, tittle-
tattle, and topsy-turvy. Many of them seem to date to the 16th century.
