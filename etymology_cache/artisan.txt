artisan (n.)

1530s, from Italian artesano, from Vulgar Latin artitianus, from Latin artitus, past participle of
artire to instruct in the arts, from ars (genitive artis) art (see art (n.)). Barnhart reports
Middle French artisan, often listed as the direct source of the English word, is attested too late
to be so.


banausic (adj.)

merely mechanical, coined 1845 from Greek banausikos pertaining to mechanics, from banausos artisan,
mere mechanical, hence (to the Greeks) base, ignoble; perhaps literally working by fire, from baunos
furnace, forge (but Klein dismisses this as folk etymology and calls it of uncertain origin).


fabric (n.)

late 15c., building, thing made, from Middle French fabrique (14c.), from Latin fabrica workshop,
also an art, trade; a skillful production, structure, fabric, from faber artisan who works in hard
materials, from PIE *dhabh- to fit together. Sense in English evolved via manufactured material
(1753) to textile (1791).


mechanic (n.)

manual laborer, late 14c., from Latin mechanicus, from Greek mekhanikos an engineer, noun use of
adjective meaning full of resources, inventive, ingenious (see mechanic (adj.)). Sense of one who is
employed in manual labor, a handicraft worker, an artisan (chief sense through early 19c.) is
attested from 1560s. Sense of skilled workman who is concerned with making or repair of machinery is
from 1660s, but not the main sense until the rise of the automobile.
