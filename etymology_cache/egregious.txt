1530s, distinguished, eminent, excellent, from Latin egregius distinguished, excellent,
extraordinary, from the phrase ex grege rising above the flock, from ex out of (see <a
href=/index.php?term=ex-&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>ex-</a>) + grege, ablative of
grex herd, flock (see <a href=/index.php?term=gregarious&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>gregarious</a>).  <br /><br />  Disapproving sense, now predominant, arose late
16c., originally ironic and is not in the Latin word, which etymologically means simply exceptional.
