by 1950, sometimes also cloud seven (1956, perhaps by confusion with seventh heaven), American
English, of uncertain origin or significance. Some connect the phrase with the 1895 International
Cloud-Atlas (Hildebrandsson, Riggenbach and Teisserenc de Bort), long the basic source for cloud
shapes, in which, of the ten cloud types, cloud No. 9, cumulonimbus, was the biggest, puffiest, most
comfortable-looking. Shipley suggests the sense in this and other expressions might be because, As
the largest one-figure integer, nine is sometimes used for emphasis. The phrase might appear in the
1935 aviation-based play Ceiling Zero by Frank Wilbur Wead.
