1660s, from Italian blando delicate, or Old French bland flattering, complimentary, both from Latin
blandus smooth-talking, flattering, alluring, perhaps from PIE *mlad-, nasalized variant of *meld-,
extended form of root *mel- (see <a href=/index.php?term=melt&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>melt</a>). Related: Blandly; blandness. Latin also had blandiloquentulus
flattering in speech, which might have yielded a useful English *blandiloquent.
