bland (adj.)

1660s, from Italian blando delicate, or Old French bland flattering, complimentary, both from Latin
blandus smooth-talking, flattering, alluring, perhaps from PIE *mlad-, nasalized variant of *meld-,
extended form of root *mel- (see melt). Related: Blandly; blandness. Latin also had
blandiloquentulus flattering in speech, which might have yielded a useful English *blandiloquent.
