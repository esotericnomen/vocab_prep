bland (adj.)

1660s, from Italian blando delicate, or Old French bland flattering, complimentary, both from Latin
blandus smooth-talking, flattering, alluring, perhaps from PIE *mlad-, nasalized variant of *meld-,
extended form of root *mel- (see melt). Related: Blandly; blandness. Latin also had
blandiloquentulus flattering in speech, which might have yielded a useful English *blandiloquent.


blandish (v.)

c.1300, from Old French blandiss-, present participle stem of blandir to flatter, caress, from Latin
blandiri flatter, soothe, caress, coax, from blandus (see bland). OED reports it rare in 17c., 18c.
Related: Blandished; blandishing.


blah (n.)

idle, meaningless talk, 1918, probably echoic; the adjective meaning bland, dull is from 1919,
perhaps influenced by French blas&eacute; bored, indifferent. The blahs depression is attested by
1966.


pabulum (n.)

food for anything, 1670s, from Latin pabulum fodder, food, nourishment, from PIE root *pa- to
protect, feed (see food) + instrumentive suffix *-dhlom.   Pablum (1932), derived from this, is a
trademark (Mead Johnson &amp; Co.) for a soft, bland cereal used as a food for infants and weak and
invalid people, hence figurative use (attested from 1970, first by U.S. Vice President Spiro Agnew)
in reference to mushy political prose.
