1610s, state of celibacy (especially as mandated to clergy in the Catholic church) from French
c&eacute;libat (16c.), from Latin caelibatus (see <a
href=/index.php?term=celibacy&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>celibacy</a>). This was
the only sense until early 19c. The adjective meaning unmarried, sworn to remain single is recorded
from 1825. As a noun, one who is sworn to such a condition, from 1838.
