trepidation (n.)

c.1600, from Middle French trepidation (15c.) and directly from Latin trepidationem (nominative
trepidatio) agitation, alarm, trembling, noun of action from past participle stem of trepidare to
tremble, hurry, from trepidus alarmed, scared, from PIE *trep- (1) to shake, tremble (cognates:
Sanskrit trprah hasty, Old Church Slavonic trepetati to tremble), related to *trem- (see tremble
(v.)).


trepid (adj.)

trembling from fear or terror, 1640s, from Latin trepidus scared (see trepidation). Related:
Trepidly; trepidness.


intrepid (adj.)

intrepidus unshaken, undaunted, from in- not (see in- (1)) + trepidus alarmed (see trepidation).

atmosphere (n.)

1630s, atmosphaera (modern form from 1670s), from Modern Latin atmosphaera, from atmo-, comb. form
of Greek atmos vapor, steam + spharia sphere (see sphere). Greek atmos is from PIE *awet-mo-, from
root *wet- (1) to blow (also to inspire, spiritually arouse; see wood (adj.)). First used in English
in connection with the Moon, which, as it turns out, practically doesn't have one.  It is observed
in the solary eclipses, that there is sometimes a great trepidation about the body of the moon, from
which we may likewise argue an atmosphaera, since we cannot well conceive what so probable a cause
there should be of such an appearance as this, Quod radii solares a vaporibus lunam ambitntibus
fuerint intercisi, that the sun-beams were broken and refracted by the vapours that encompassed the
moon. [Rev. John Wilkins, Discovery of New World or Discourse tending to prove that it probable
there may be another World in the Moon,  1638]     Figurative sense of surrounding influence, mental
or moral environment is c.1800.
