cozen (v.)

1560s, of uncertain origin; perhaps from French cousiner cheat on pretext of being a cousin; or from
Middle English cosyn fraud, trickery (mid-15c.), which is perhaps related to Old French co&ccedil;on
dealer, merchant, trader, from Latin cocionem horse dealer. Related: Cozened; cozening; cozenage.
