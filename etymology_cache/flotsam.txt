c.1600, from Anglo-French floteson, from Old French flotaison a floating, from floter to float (of
Germanic origin; see <a href=/index.php?term=float&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>float</a>) + -aison, from Latin -ation(em). Spelled flotsen till mid-19c. when
it altered, perhaps under influence of many English words in -some.  <br /><br />  In British law,
flotsam are goods found floating on the sea as a consequence of a shipwreck or action of wind or
waves; jetsam are things cast out of a ship in danger of being wrecked, and afterward washed ashore,
or things cast ashore by the sailors. Whatever sinks is lagan. Figurative use for odds and ends
attested by 1861.
