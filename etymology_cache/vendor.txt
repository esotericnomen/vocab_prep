vendor (n.)

1590s, from late Anglo-French vendor, from vendre to vend, from Latin vendere to sell (see vend).
More common in legal use than vender.


milliner (n.)

mid-15c., vendor of fancy wares, especially those made in Milan, Italian city, famous for straw
works, fancy goods, ribbons, bonnets, and cutlery. Meaning one who sells women's hats may be from
1520s, certainly by 18c. (it is difficult in early references to know whether the word means a type
of merchant or a resident of Milan who is selling certain wares).


hawk (v.1)

to sell in the open, peddle, late 15c., back-formation from hawker itinerant vendor (c.1400), from
Middle Low German h&ouml;ken to peddle, carry on the back, squat, from Proto-Germanic *huk-.
Related: Hawked; hawking. Despite the etymological connection with stooping under a burden on one's
back, a hawker is technically distinguished from a peddler by use of a horse and cart or a van.


teach (v.)

Old English t&aelig;can (past tense t&aelig;hte, past participle t&aelig;ht) to show, point out,
declare, demonstrate, also to give instruction, train, assign, direct; warn; persuade, from Proto-
Germanic *taikijan to show (cognates: Old High German zihan, German zeihen to accuse, Gothic ga-
teihan to announce), from PIE *deik- to show, point out (see diction). Related to Old English tacen,
tacn sign, mark (see token). Related: Taught; teaching.    enraged Lemonade Vendor [Edgar Kennedy]:
I'll teach you to kick me!   Chico: you don't have to teach me, I know how. [kicks him]    The usual
sense of Old English t&aelig;can was show, declare, warn, persuade (compare German zeigen to show,
from the same root); while the Old English word for to teach, instruct, guide was more commonly
l&aelig;ran, source of modern learn and lore.
