leader, the state of people without a government (in Athens, used of the Year of Thirty Tyrants, 404
B.C., when there was no archon), noun of state from anarkhos rulerless, from an- without (see <a

<blockquote>  Either the State for ever, crushing individual and local life, taking over in all
fields of human activity, bringing with it its wars and its domestic struggles for power, its palace
revolutions which only replace one tyrant by another, and inevitably at the end of this development
there is ... death! Or the destruction of States, and new life starting again in thousands of
centers on the principle of the lively initiative of the individual and groups and that of free
agreement. The choice lies with you! [Prince Peter Kropotkin (1842-1921)]  </blockquote>
