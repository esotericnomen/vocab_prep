anarchy (n.)

1530s, from French anarchie or directly from Medieval Latin anarchia, from Greek anarkhia lack of a
leader, the state of people without a government (in Athens, used of the Year of Thirty Tyrants, 404
B.C., when there was no archon), noun of state from anarkhos rulerless, from an- without (see an-
(1)) + arkhos leader (see archon).    Either the State for ever, crushing individual and local life,
taking over in all fields of human activity, bringing with it its wars and its domestic struggles
for power, its palace revolutions which only replace one tyrant by another, and inevitably at the
end of this development there is ... death! Or the destruction of States, and new life starting
again in thousands of centers on the principle of the lively initiative of the individual and groups
and that of free agreement. The choice lies with you! [Prince Peter Kropotkin (1842-1921)]
