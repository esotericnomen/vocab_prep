late 14c., hommen make a murmuring sound to cover embarrassment, later hummen to buzz, drone (early
15c.), probably of imitative origin. Sense of sing with closed lips is first attested late 15c.;
that of be busy and active is 1884, perhaps on analogy of a beehive. Related: Hummed; humming.
Humming-bird (1630s) so called from sound made by the rapid vibration of its wings.<blockquote>There
is a curious bird to see to, called a humming bird, no bigger then a great Beetle. [Thomas Morton,
New English Canaan, 1637]</blockquote>
