1620s, from Latin effetus (usually in fem. effeta) exhausted, unproductive, worn out (with bearing
offspring), past bearing, literally that has given birth, from a lost verb, *efferi, from ex- out
(see <a href=/index.php?term=ex-&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>ex-</a>) + fetus
childbearing, offspring (see <a href=/index.php?term=fetus&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>fetus</a>). Figurative use is earliest in English; literal use is rare. Sense
of exhausted is 1660s; that of intellectually or morally exhausted (1790) led to decadent (19c.).
