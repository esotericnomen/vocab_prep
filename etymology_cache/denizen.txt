denizen (n.)

early 15c., from Anglo-French deinzein, from deinz within, inside, from Late Latin deintus, from de-
from + intus within (see ento-). Historically, an alien admitted to certain rights of citizenship; a
naturalized citizen.


peak (n.)

pointed top, 1520s, variant of pike (n.4) sharp point. Meaning top of a mountain first recorded
1630s, though pike was used in this sense c.1400. Figurative sense is 1784. Meaning point formed by
hair on the forehead is from 1833. According to OED, The Peak in Derbyshire is older than the word
for mountaintop; compare Old English Peaclond, for the district, Pecsaetan, for the people who
settled there, Peaces &#230;rs for Peak Cavern; sometimes said to be a reference to an elf-denizen
Peac Puck.


citizen (n.)

early 14c., inhabitant of a city, from Anglo-French citezein (spelling subsequently altered,
probably by influence of denizen), from Old French citeien city-dweller, town-dweller, citizen
(12c., Modern French citoyen), from cite (see city) + -ain (see -ian). Replaced Old English
burhsittend and ceasterware. Sense of inhabitant of a country is late 14c. Citizen's arrest recorded
from 1941; citizen's band (radio) from 1947. Citizen of the world (late 15c.) translates Greek
kosmopolites.
