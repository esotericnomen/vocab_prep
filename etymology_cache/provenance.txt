provenance (n.)

1785, from French provenance origin, production, from provenant, present participle of Middle French
provenir come forth, arise, originate, from Latin provenire come forth, originate, appear, arise,
from pro- forth (see pro-) + venire come (see venue).


provenience (n.)

1881, a Latinization of provenance, or else from Latin provenientem (nominative proveniens), present
participle of provenire come forth (see provenance). Preferred to PROVENANCE by those who object to
the French form of the latter [OED].


fig (n.)

early 13c., from Old French figue (12c.), from Old Proven&ccedil;al figa, from Vulgar Latin *fica,
from Latin ficus fig tree, fig, which, with Greek sykon, Armenian t'uz is prob. fr. a common
Mediterranean source [Buck], possibly a Semitic one (compare Phoenician pagh half-ripe fig). A
reborrowing of a word that had been taken directly from Latin as Old English fic.    The insulting
sense of the word in Shakespeare, etc. (A fig for ...) is 1570s, in part from fig as small,
valueless thing, but also from Greek and Italian use of their versions of the word as slang for
vulva, apparently because of how a ripe fig looks when split open [Rawson, Weekley]. Giving the fig
(French faire la figue, Spanish dar la higa) was an indecent gesture of ancient provenance, made by
putting the thumb between two fingers or into the mouth, with the intended effect of the modern
gesture of flipping the bird (see bird (n.3)). Also compare sycophant. Use of fig leaf in figurative
sense of flimsy disguise (1550s) is from Gen. iii:7.
