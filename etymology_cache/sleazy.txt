sleazy (adj.)

1640s, downy, fuzzy, later flimsy, unsubstantial (1660s), of unknown origin; one theory is that it
is a corruption of Silesia, the German region, where thin linen or cotton fabric was made for
export. Silesia in reference to cloth is attested in English from 1670s; and sleazy as an
abbreviated form is attested from 1670), but OED is against this. Sense of sordid is from 1941.
Related: Sleazily; sleaziness.    A day is a more magnificent cloth than any muslin, the mechanism
that makes it is infinitely cunninger, and you shall not conceal the sleazy, fraudulent, rotten
hours you have slipped into the piece, nor fear that any honest thread, or straighter steel, or more
inflexible shaft, will not testify in the web. [Emerson, The Conduct of Life, 1860]


sleaze (n.)

condition of squalor, by 1967, back-formation from sleazy. Meaning person of low moral standards,
and the adjectival use, are attested from 1976.
