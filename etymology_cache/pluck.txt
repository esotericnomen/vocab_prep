pluck (n.)

c.1400, act of plucking, from pluck (v.). Meaning courage, boldness (1785), originally in pugilism
slang, is a figurative use from earlier meaning heart, viscera (1610s) as that which is plucked from
slaughtered livestock. Perhaps influenced by figurative use of the verb in pluck up (one's courage,
etc.), attested from c.1300.
