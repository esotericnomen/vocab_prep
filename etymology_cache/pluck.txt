c.1400, act of plucking, from <a href=/index.php?term=pluck&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>pluck</a> (v.). Meaning courage, boldness (1785), originally in pugilism slang,
is a figurative use from earlier meaning heart, viscera (1610s) as that which is plucked from
slaughtered livestock. Perhaps influenced by figurative use of the verb in pluck up (one's courage,
etc.), attested from c.1300.
