of Scotland, 1590s, contraction of <a href=/index.php?term=Scottish&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>Scottish</a>. Disdained by the Scottish because of the many insulting and
pejorative formations made from it by the English (such as Scotch greys lice; Scotch attorney, a
Jamaica term from 1864 for strangler vines).  <br /><br /> Scotch-Irish is from 1744 (adj.); 1789
(n.); more properly Scots-Irish (1966), from Scots (mid-14c.), the older adjective, which is from
Scottis, the northern variant of Scottish. Scots (adj.) was used in Scottish until 18c., then Scotch
became vernacular, but in mid-19c. there was a reaction against it. Scotch Tape was said to be so
called because at first it had adhesive only on the edges (to make it easier to remove as a masking
tape in car paint jobs), which was interpreted as a sign of cheapness on the part of the
manufacturers.
