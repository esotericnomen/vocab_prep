Scotch (adj.)

of Scotland, 1590s, contraction of Scottish. Disdained by the Scottish because of the many insulting
and pejorative formations made from it by the English (such as Scotch greys lice; Scotch attorney, a
Jamaica term from 1864 for strangler vines).   Scotch-Irish is from 1744 (adj.); 1789 (n.); more
properly Scots-Irish (1966), from Scots (mid-14c.), the older adjective, which is from Scottis, the
northern variant of Scottish. Scots (adj.) was used in Scottish until 18c., then Scotch became
vernacular, but in mid-19c. there was a reaction against it. Scotch Tape was said to be so called
because at first it had adhesive only on the edges (to make it easier to remove as a masking tape in
car paint jobs), which was interpreted as a sign of cheapness on the part of the manufacturers.
