dupe, saphead, rogues' slang from late 16c., perhaps a shortening of cullion base fellow, originally
testicle (from French couillon, from Old French coillon testicle; worthless fellow, dolt, from Latin
coleus, literally strainer bag; see <a href=/index.php?term=cojones&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>cojones</a>), though another theory traces it to Romany (Gypsy) chulai man.
Also sometimes cully, though some authorities assert cully was the canting term for dupe and cull
was generic man, fellow, without implication of gullibility. Compare also <a
