crux (n.)

1814, cross, from Latin crux cross (see cross (n.)). Figurative use for a central difficulty, is
older, from 1718; perhaps from Latin crux interpretum a point in a text that is impossible to
interpret, in which the literal sense is something like crossroads of interpreters. Extended sense
of central point is from 1888.
