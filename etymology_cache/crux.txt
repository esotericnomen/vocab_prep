1814, cross, from Latin crux cross (see <a href=/index.php?term=cross&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>cross</a> (n.)). Figurative use for a central difficulty, is older, from 1718;
perhaps from Latin crux interpretum a point in a text that is impossible to interpret, in which the
literal sense is something like crossroads of interpreters. Extended sense of central point is from
1888.
