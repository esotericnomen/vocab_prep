1530s gloomy, from Latin morosus morose, peevish, hypercritical, fastidious, from mos (genitive
moris) habit, custom (see <a href=/index.php?term=moral&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>moral</a> (adj.)). In English, manners by itself means (good) manners, but here
the implication in Latin is (bad) manners. Related: Morosity.
