pun (n.)

1660s (first attested in Dryden), of uncertain origin, perhaps from pundigron, which is perhaps a
humorous alteration of Italian puntiglio equivocation, trivial objection, diminutive of Latin
punctum point. This is pure speculation. The verb also is attested from 1660s. Related: Punned;
punning.  <blockquote> Pun was prob. one of the clipped words, such as cit, mob, nob, snob, which
came into fashionable slang at or after the Restoration. [OED]  </blockquote>
