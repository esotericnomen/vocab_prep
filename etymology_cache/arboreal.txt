arboreal (adj.)

1660s, from Latin arboreus pertaining to trees, from arbor tree, of unknown origin, + -al (1).


indri (n.)

1839, European name for the babakoto, a lemur-like arboreal primate of Madagascar (Indris
Lichanotus); the common story since late 19c. is that the name was given in error by French
naturalist Pierre Sonnerat (1748-1814), c.1780, from mistaken use of Malagasy indry! look! See!
Evidently this was what his native guides said when they spotted the creature and called his
attention to it.    However, as Hacking (1981) pointed out, Sonnerat was far too familiar with
indris -- he described and figured them in detail, and apparently kept at least one in captivity --
for this story to be plausible. Furthermore, endrina is actually recorded as a native name for the
indri (Cousins, 1885), and indri could easily be a variant of this name. Although the word endrina
is first recorded in Malagasy only in 1835, there is no evidence that it could be a back-formation
from the French indri (Hacking, 1981), and it seems implausible that the Malagasy would adopt an
erroneous French name for an animal they were them selves familiar with. [Dunkel, Alexander R., et
