laconic (adj.)

concise, abrupt, 1580s, probably via Latin Laconicus, from Greek Lakonikos, from Lakon person from
Lakonia, the district around Sparta in southern Greece in ancient times, whose inhabitants were
famously proud of their brevity of speech. When Philip of Macedon threatened them with, If I enter
Laconia, I will raze Sparta to the ground, the Spartans' reply was, If. An earlier form was
laconical (1570s). Related: Laconically.
