celadon (n.)

pale grayish-green, 1768, from French C&eacute;ladon, name of a character in the romance of
l'Astr&eacute;e by Honor&eacute; d'Urf&eacute; (1610); an insipidly sentimental lover who wore
bright green clothes, he is named in turn after Greek Keladon, a character in Ovid's Metamorphoses,
whose name is said to mean sounding with din or clamor. The mineral celadonite (1868) is so called
for its color.


rumor (n.)

late 14c., from Old French rumor commotion, widespread noise or report (Modern French rumeur), from
Latin rumorem (nominative rumor) noise, clamor, common talk, hearsay, popular opinion, related to
ravus hoarse, from PIE *reu- to bellow. Related: Rumorous. Rumor mill is from 1887. Dutch rumoer,
German Rumor are from French.


noise (n.)

early 13c., loud outcry, clamor, shouting, from Old French noise din, disturbance, uproar, brawl
(11c., in modern French only in phrase chercher noise to pick a quarrel), also rumor, report, news,
apparently from Latin nausea disgust, annoyance, discomfort, literally seasickness (see nausea).
Another theory traces the Old French word to Latin noxia hurting, injury, damage. OED considers that
the sense of the word is against both suggestions, but nausea could have developed a sense in Vulgar
Latin of unpleasant situation, noise, quarrel (compare Old Proven&ccedil;al nauza noise, quarrel).
Meaning loud or unpleasant sound is from c.1300. Replaced native gedyn (see din).
