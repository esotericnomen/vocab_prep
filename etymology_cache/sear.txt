sear (v.)

Old English searian (intransitive) dry up, to wither, from Proto-Germanic *saurajan (cognates:
Middle Dutch soor dry, Old High German soren become dry), from root of sear dried up, withered (see
sere). Meaning cause to wither is from early 15c. Meaning to brand, to burn by hot iron is recorded
from c.1400, originally especially of cauterizing wounds; figurative use is from 1580s. Related:
Seared; searing.


sere (adj.)

Old English sear dried up, withered, barren, from Proto-Germanic *sauzas (cognates: Middle Low
German sor, Dutch zoor), from PIE root *saus- dry (cognates: Sanskrit susyati dries, withers; Old
Persian u&#353;ka- dry (adj.), land (n.); Avestan hu&#353;ka- dry; Latin sudus dry). A good word now
relegated to bad poetry. Related to sear. Sere month was an old name for August.


sorrel (adj.)

reddish brown, especially of horses, mid-14c., from Old French sorel, from sor yellowish-brown,
probably from Frankish *saur dry, or some other Germanic source, from Proto-Germanic *sauza-
(cognates: Middle Dutch soor dry, Old High German soren to become dry, Old English sear withered,
barren; see sere). Perhaps a diminutive form in French.


scathe (v.)

c.1200, from Old Norse ska&eth;a to hurt, harm, damage, injure, from Proto-Germanic *skath-
(cognates: Old English scea&thorn;ian to hurt, injure, Old Saxon skathon, Old Frisian skethia,
Middle Dutch scaden, Dutch schaden, Old High German scadon, German schaden, Gothic sca&thorn;jan to
injure, damage), from PIE root *sket- to injure. Only cognate outside Germanic seems to be in Greek
a-skethes unharmed, unscathed.    It survives mostly in its negative form, unscathed, and in
figurative meaning sear with invective or satire (1852, usually as scathing) which developed from
the sense of scar, scorch used by Milton in Paradise Lost i.613 (1667).
