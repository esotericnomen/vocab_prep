heist (v.)

1927 (in heister shoplifter, thief), American English slang, probably a dialectal alteration of
hoist lift, in sense of shoplift, also in older British slang to lift another on one's shoulders to
help him break in. As a noun, from 1936.


rile (v.)

1825, American English spelling alteration to reflect a dialectal pronunciation of roil (q.v.);
compare heist from hoist and in the same era spile for spoil (v.). Bartlett writes that in both
England and America roil is now commonly pronounced and written rile [Dictionary of Americanisms,
1848]. Related: Riled; riling.
