1610s, closely attentive, perhaps from obsolete wistly intently (c.1500), of uncertain origin.
Perhaps formed on the model of wishful. Middle English wistful meant bountiful, well-supplied, from
Old English wist provisions. The meaning of longingly pensive, musing is by 1714. Related:
Wistfully; wistfulness.
