censure (v.)

1580s, from censure (n.) or else  from French censurer, from censure (n.). Related: Censured;
censuring.  <blockquote>  Such men are so watchful to censure, that the have seldom much care to
look for favourable interpretations of ambiguities, to set the general tenor of life against single
failures, or to know how soon any slip of inadvertency has been expiated by sorrow and retractation;
but let fly their fulminations, without mercy or prudence, against slight offences or casual
temerities, against crimes never committed, or immediately repented. [Johnson, Life of Sir Thomas
Browne, 1756]  </blockquote>
