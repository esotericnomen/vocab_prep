antiseptic (adj.)

1750, coined from anti- against + septic. Figurative use by 1820. As a noun meaning an antiseptic
substance by 1803.


Listerine (n.)

1879, American English, formulated by Dr. Joseph Lawrence and Jordan Wheat Lambert as a multi-
purpose disinfectant and anti-septic for surgery. In 1895, after it was discovered to kill germs
commonly found in the mouth, the Lambert Company started marketing it as an oral antiseptic. Named
for Joseph Lord Lister (1827-1912), F.R.S., O.M., English surgeon, who revolutionized modern surgery
by applying Pasteur's discoveries and performing the first ever antiseptic surgery in 1865. Lister
objected in vain to the use of his name on the product. Lister (attested from 1286, an Anglian
surname) is from Middle English lit(t)e to dye (see litmus) + fem. suffix -ster, hence, a dyer.


phenol (n.)

carbolic acid, 1844, from pheno- + -ol. Discovered in coal tar in 1834; used as an antiseptic from
1867. Related: Phenolic.


creosote (n.)

1835, from German Kreosot, coined 1832 by its discoverer, German-born natural philosopher Carl
Ludwig, Baron Reichenbach (1788-1869), from Greek kreo-, comb. form of kreas flesh (see raw) + soter
preserver, from soizein save, preserve. So called because it was used as an antiseptic.
