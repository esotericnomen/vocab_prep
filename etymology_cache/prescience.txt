sixth (adj.)

1520s, replacing Middle English sixte (c.1200), from Old English syxte, from siex (see six). Compare
Old Frisian sexta, Middle Dutch seste, Old High German sehsto, German sechste, Gothic saihsta. With
ending conformed to -th (1). Related: Sixthly. The noun meaning a sixth part is from 1550s. As a
music tone, from 1590s. Sixth sense supernatural perception of objects is attested from 1712;
earlier it meant titillation, the sense that apprehends sexual pleasure (1690s, from Scaliger).
Then said Peter, That is false; for there is a sixth Sense, that of Prescience : for the other five
Senses are capable only of Knowledg ; but the Sixth of Foreknowledg ; which Sense the Prophets had.
