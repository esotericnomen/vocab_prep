commensurate (adj.)

1640s, from Late Latin commensuratus, from Latin com- with (see com-) + Late Latin mensuratus, past
participle of mensurare to measure, from mensura (see measure (v.)).


incommensurate (adj.)

1640s, from in- (1) not, opposite of + commensurate.


meet (adj.)

proper, fitting, Old English gem&aelig;te, Anglian *gemete, suitable, having the same dimensions,
from Proto-Germanic *ga-m&aelig;tijaz (cognates: Old Norse m&aelig;tr, Old High German gimagi,
German gem&auml;&szlig; suitable), from collective prefix *ga- + PIE *med- to measure (see medical
(adj.)). The basic formation is thus the same as that of commensurate.
