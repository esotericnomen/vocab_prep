rebus (n.)

c.1600, from Latin rebus by means of objects, ablative plural of res thing, object. According to
French sources, principally from the phrase de rebus qu&aelig; geruntur of things which are going
on, in reference to the satirical pieces composed by Picardy clerks at carnivals, subtle satires of
current events using pictures to suggest words, phrases or things. Or it may be from the
representations being non verbis sed rebus not by words, but by things. In either case from Latin
res thing.
