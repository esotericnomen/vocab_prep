bulwark (n.)

early 15c., from Middle Dutch bulwerke or Middle High German bolwerc, probably from bole plank, tree
trunk (from Proto-Germanic *bul-, from PIE root *bhel- (2) to blow, swell; see bole) + werc work
(see work (n.)). Figurative sense is from 1570s.


boulevard (n.)

1769, from French boulevard (15c.), originally top surface of a military rampart, from a garbled
attempt to adopt Middle Dutch bolwerc wall of a fortification (see bulwark) into French, which at
that time lacked a -w- in its alphabet. The notion is of a promenade laid out atop demolished city
walls, a way which would be much wider than urban streets. Originally in English with conscious
echoes of Paris; since 1929, in U.S., used of multi-lane limited-access urban highways. Early French
attempts to digest the Dutch word also include boloart, boulever, boloirque, bollvercq.
