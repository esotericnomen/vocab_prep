lounge (n.)

comfortable drawing room, 1881, from lounge (v.); in the sense of couch on which one can lie at full
length, it is attested from 1830. Lounge lizard is by 1917, perhaps from 1912, a term of contempt,
originally in reference to men who hung around in tea rooms to flirt.


lounge (v.)

to loll idly, c.1500, Scottish, of uncertain origin, perhaps [Barnhart] from French s'allonger
(paresseusement) to lounge about, lie at full length, from Old French alongier lengthen, from Latin
longus long (see long (adj.)). Another etymology traces it through obsolete lungis (n.) slow, lazy
person (c.1560), from Middle French longis, a generic application of Longinus, supposed to be the
name of the centurion who pierced Christ's side with a spear in John xix:34. Popular etymology
associated the name directly with long (adj.). Related: Lounged; lounging.


chaise (n.)

1701, pleasure carriage, from French chaise chair (15c.), dialectal variant of chaire (see chair
(n.)) due to 15c.-16c. Parisian accent swapping of -r- and -s-, a habit often satirized by French
writers. French chair and chaise then took respectively the senses of high seat, throne, pulpit and
chair, seat. Chaise lounge (1800) is corruption of French chaise longue long chair, the second word
confused in English with lounge.


loll (v.)

mid-14c., lollen to lounge idly, hang loosely, perhaps related to Middle Dutch lollen to doze,
mumble, or somehow imitative of rocking or swinging. Specifically of the tongue from 1610s. Related:
Lolled; lolling. As a noun, from 1709. Grose [Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue, 1785] has lollpoop A
lazy, idle drone.
