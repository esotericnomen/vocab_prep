fem. of ambrosios, probably literally of the immortals, from a- not (see a- (3)) + mbrotos, related
to mortos mortal, from PIE *mer- to die (see mortal (adj.)). Applied to certain herbs by Pliny and
Dioscorides; used of various foods for mortals since 1680s (originally of fruit drinks); used

Ambrose

masc. proper name, from Latin Ambrosius, from Greek ambrosios immortal, belonging to the immortals

ambrotype (n.)

1855, American English, apparently from Greek ambrotos immortal, imperishable (see ambrosia), with
second element from daguerreotype. A type of photograph on glass with lights given by silver and
shades by a dark background showing through.    This invention consists in an improved process of
taking photographic pictures upon glass, and also of beautifying and preserving the same, which
process I have styled ambrotype. My improved process has reference to the art of taking pictures
photographically on a film of collodion upon the surface of a sheet of glass, the collodion being
suitably prepared for the purpose. By the use of the said process, the beauty and permanency of such
pictures are greatly increased, and I have on this account styled the process ambrotype, from the
Greek word ambrotos, immortal. [Specification of the Patent granted to James A. Cutting, of Boston,
in the United States of America, Photographer, for an Improved Process of taking Photographic
Pictures upon Glass and also of Beautifying and Preserving the same. Dated London, July 26, 1854,
printed in Journal of the Franklin Institute, September 1855]
