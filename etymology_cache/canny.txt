1630s, Scottish and northern English formation from <a
href=/index.php?term=can&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>can</a> (v.1) in its sense of
know how to, + <a href=/index.php?term=-y&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>-y</a> (2).
Knowing, hence, careful. A doublet of cunning that flowed into distinct senses. Often used
superciliously of Scots by their southern neighbors (and their American cousins).  <blockquote>  The
Canny Scot is so well known as scarcely to require description. He carries caution, cunning, and
selfishness to excess. Deceitful when a purpose is to be accomplished, he is not habitually
deceitful. One thing he never loses sight of--his own interest. But of his own interest he is not
the most enlightened judge. [The Natural History of Scotsmen, in The Argosy, December 1865]
