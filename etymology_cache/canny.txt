canny (adj.)

1630s, Scottish and northern English formation from can (v.1) in its sense of know how to, + -y (2).
Knowing, hence, careful. A doublet of cunning that flowed into distinct senses. Often used
superciliously of Scots by their southern neighbors (and their American cousins).    The Canny Scot
is so well known as scarcely to require description. He carries caution, cunning, and selfishness to
excess. Deceitful when a purpose is to be accomplished, he is not habitually deceitful. One thing he
never loses sight of--his own interest. But of his own interest he is not the most enlightened
judge. [The Natural History of Scotsmen, in The Argosy, December 1865]    Related: Cannily;
canniness.


uncanny (adj.)

1590s, mischievous; 1773 in the sense of associated with the supernatural, originally Scottish and
northern English, from un- (1) not + canny.
