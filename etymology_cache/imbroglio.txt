imbroglio (n.)

1750, from Italian imbroglio, from imbrogliare confuse, tangle, from assimilated form of in- into,
in, on, upon (see in- (2)) + brogliare embroil, probably from Middle French brouiller confuse (see
broil (v.2); also see embroil).


broil (v.2)

early 15c., to quarrel, brawl, also mix up, present in disorder, from Anglo-French broiller mix up,
confuse, Old French brooillier to mix, mingle, figuratively to have sexual intercourse (13c., Modern
French brouiller), perhaps from breu, bro stock, broth, brew, from Frankish or another Germanic
source (compare Old High German brod broth) akin to broth (see brew (v.)); also compare imbroglio.
