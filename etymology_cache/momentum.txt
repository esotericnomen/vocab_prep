Psychological moment was in vogue from 1871, from French moment psychologique moment of immediate
expectation of something about to happen.    The original German phrase, misinterpreted by the
French &amp; imported together with its false sense into English, meant the psychic factor, the
mental effect, the influence exerted by a state of mind, &amp; not a point of time at all, das
Moment in German corresponding to our momentum, not our moment. [Fowler]


moment (n.)

mid-14c., very brief portion of time, instant, in moment of time, from Old French moment (12c.)
moment, minute; importance, weight, value or directly from Latin momentum movement, motion; moving
power; alteration, change; also short time, instant (also source of Spanish, Italian momento),
contraction of *movimentum, from movere to move (see move (v.)). Some (but not OED) explain the
sense evolution of the Latin word by notion of a particle so small it would just move the pointer of
a scale, which led to the transferred sense of minute time division. Sense of importance, 'weight'
is attested in English from 1520s.    Phrase never a dull moment first recorded 1889 in Jerome K.
Jerome's Three Men in a Boat. Phrase moment of truth first recorded 1932 in Hemingway's Death in the
Afternoon, from Spanish el momento de la verdad, the final sword-thrust in a bull-fight.
