transcend (v.)

mid-14c., escape inclusion in; lie beyond the scope of, from Old French transcendre transcend,
surpass, and directly from Latin transcendere climb over or beyond, surmount, overstep, from trans-
beyond (see trans-) + scandere to climb (see scan (v.)). Meanings be surpassing, outdo, excel;
surmount, move beyond are from early 15c. Related: Transcended; transcending.


transcendent (adj.)

mid-15c., from Latin transcendentem (nominative transcendens) surmounting, rising above, present
participle of transcendere (see transcend). Related: Transcendently.


pre-eminent (adj.)

also preeminent, mid-15c., from Medieval Latin preeminentem, from Latin praeeminentem (nominative
praeeminens), present participle of praeeminare to transcend, excel, literally to project forward,
rise above (see pre-eminence). Related: Pre-eminently; preeminently.


pre-eminence (n.)

also pre-eminence, c.1200, from Late Latin praeeminentia distinction, superiority, from Latin
praeeminentem (nominative praeeminens), present participle of praeeminere transcend, excel,
literally project forward, rise above, from prae before (see pre-) + eminere stand out, project (see
eminent).


orthopraxy (n.)

1840, from ortho- + Greek praxis a doing, action, performance (see praxis).   Errata -- Page 263,
line 9 from bottom, for 'orthodoxy' read orthopraxy. This is a new coin from the mint of Dr.
[Andrew] Wylie [of Bloomington College, Indiana], at least I have not before noticed it. Its
etymology places it in a just contrast with orthodoxy: for if that consecrated word indicates
thinking right, orthopraxy will legitimately import doing right, and hence, as Mr. Wylie says,
orthopraxy in the last dread day will pass the divine ordeal incomparably better than orthodoxy. O!
that a zeal for orthopraxy would transcend the zeal for orthodoxy! [The Millennial Harbinger, vol.
IV, no. VIII, Bethany, Va., August 1840]
