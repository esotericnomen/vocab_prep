dapper (adj.)

mid-15c., elegant, from Middle Dutch or Middle Low German dapper bold, strong, sturdy, later quick,
nimble, from Proto-Germanic *dapraz, perhaps with ironical shift of meaning (cognates: Old High
German tapfar heavy, German tapfer brave), from PIE root *dheb- dense, firm, compressed.


spruce (adj.)

neat, smart in dress and appearance, dapper, brisk, 1580s, from spruce leather (mid-15c.; see spruce
(n.)), a type of leather imported from Prussia in the 1400s and 1500s which was used in England to
make a popular style of jerkin that was considered smart-looking.


dap (n.)

fist-bump greeting, with various theories as to origin and name meaning. In U.S. popular black
culture by 1972 and controversial during the Vietnam War when used by U.S. soldiers, as it often was
regarded by whites as a ritual act of black solidarity. Probably imitative (dap was used in 19c. for
the bounce of a ball or the skip of a stone on water). Dap, meanwhile, is listed in the DAS as black
slang c.1950 for aware, up to date, also stylish, well-dressed, in the latter case at least a
shortening of dapper.
