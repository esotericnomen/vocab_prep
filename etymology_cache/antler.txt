late 14c., from Anglo-French auntiler, Old French antoillier (14c., Modern French andouiller)
antler, perhaps from Gallo-Roman cornu *antoculare horn in front of the eyes, from Latin ante before
(see <a href=/index.php?term=ante&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>ante</a>) + ocularis
of the eyes (see <a href=/index.php?term=ocular&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>ocular</a>). This etymology is doubted by some because no similar word exists
in any other Romance language, but compare German Augensprossen antlers, literally eye-sprouts, for
a similar formation.
