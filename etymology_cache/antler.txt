antler (n.)

late 14c., from Anglo-French auntiler, Old French antoillier (14c., Modern French andouiller)
antler, perhaps from Gallo-Roman cornu *antoculare horn in front of the eyes, from Latin ante before
(see ante) + ocularis of the eyes (see ocular). This etymology is doubted by some because no similar
word exists in any other Romance language, but compare German Augensprossen antlers, literally eye-
sprouts, for a similar formation.
