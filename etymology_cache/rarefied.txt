learned Latinized reformation of earlier sotil (12c.), source of subtle (q.v.). Still used in some
Bible translations in Gen. iii:1, and it survived after 17c. as a parallel formation to subtle in
some material senses (fine, delicate, thin).


rarefy (v.)

late 14c., from Old French rarefier (14c.) and directly from Medieval Latin rarificare, from Latin
rarefacere make rare, from rarus rare, thin (see rare (adj.1)) + facere to make (see factitious).
