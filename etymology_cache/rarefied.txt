subtile (adj.)

late 14c., clever, dexterous, crafty; not dense, thin, rarefied, from Old French subtil (14c.), a
learned Latinized reformation of earlier sotil (12c.), source of subtle (q.v.). Still used in some
Bible translations in Gen. iii:1, and it survived after 17c. as a parallel formation to subtle in
some material senses (fine, delicate, thin).
