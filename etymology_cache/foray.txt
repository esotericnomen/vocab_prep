late 14c., Scottish, from the verb (14c.), perhaps a back-formation of Middle English forreyer
raider, forager (mid-14c.), from Old French forrier, from forrer to forage (see <a
href=/index.php?term=forage&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>forage</a> (n.)). Disused by
18c.; revived by Scott.
