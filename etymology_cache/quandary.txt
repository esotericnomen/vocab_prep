quandary (n.)

state of perplexity, 1570s, of unknown origin, perhaps a quasi-Latinism based on Latin quando when?
at what time?; at the time that, inasmuch, pronomial adverb of time, related to qui who (see who).
Originally accented on the second syllable.


cue (n.1)

stage direction, 1550s, from Q, which was used 16c., 17c. in stage plays to indicate actors'
entrances, probably as an abbreviation of Latin quando when (see quandary) or a similar Latin
adverb. Shakespeare has it as both Q and cue.
