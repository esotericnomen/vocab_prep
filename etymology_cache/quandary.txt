state of perplexity, 1570s, of unknown origin, perhaps a quasi-Latinism based on Latin quando when?
at what time?; at the time that, inasmuch, pronomial adverb of time, related to qui who (see <a
href=/index.php?term=who&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>who</a>). Originally accented
on the second syllable.
