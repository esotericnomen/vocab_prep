ideologue (n.)

1815, in reference to the French Revolutionaries, from French ideologue, from Greek idea (see idea)
+ -logos (see -logue). Earlier form was ideologist (1798).


-logue

word-forming element meaning one who is immersed in or driven by, mostly from French-derived words,
ultimately from Greek -logos, -logon. Now mostly superseded by -loger, -logist except in ideologue
and a few others. As a combining element meaning kind of discourse, it is from French -logue, from
Greek -logos.
