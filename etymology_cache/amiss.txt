mid-13c., amis off the mark, also out of order, literally on the miss, from a in, on (see <a
href=/index.php?term=a-&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>a-</a> (1)) + missen fail to hit
(see <a href=/index.php?term=miss&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>miss</a> (v.)). To
take (something) amiss originally (late 14c.) was to miss the meaning of (see <a
href=/index.php?term=mistake&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>mistake</a>). Now it means
to misinterpret in a bad sense.
