caliber (n.)

1560s, degree of merit or importance, a figurative use from Middle French calibre (late 15c.),
apparently ultimately from Arabic qalib a mold for casting. Arabic also used the word in the sense
mold for casting bullets, which is the oldest literal meaning in English. Meaning inside diameter of
a gun barrel is attested from 1580s. Barnhart remarks that Spanish calibre, Italian calibro appear
too late to act as intermediate forms between the Arabic word and the French.
