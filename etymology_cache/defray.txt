defray (v.)

1540s, from Middle French defraier (15c.), from de- out (see de-) + fraier spend, from Old French
frais costs, damages caused by breakage, from Latin fractum, neuter past participle of frangere to
break (see fraction). Alternative etymology traces second element to Old High German fridu peace,
via Vulgar Latin *fredum fine, cost.
