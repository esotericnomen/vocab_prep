by (prep.)

Old English be- (unstressed) or bi (stressed) near, in, by, during, about, from Proto-Germanic *bi
around, about (cognates: Old Saxon and Old Frisian bi by near, Middle Dutch bie, Dutch bij, German
bei by, at, near, Gothic bi about), from *umbi (cognate with second element in PIE *ambhi around;
see ambi-).    Originally an adverbial particle of place, in which sense it is retained in place
names (Whitby, Grimsby, etc.). Elliptical use for secondary course (opposed to main, as in byway,
also compare by-blow illegitimate child, 1590s) was in Old English. This also is the sense of the
second by in the phrase by the by (1610s). By the way literally means in passing by (mid-14c.); used
figuratively to introduce a tangential observation by 1540s.    Phrase by and by (early 14c.)
originally meant one by one, modern sense is from 1520s. By and large (1660s) originally was
nautical, sailing to the wind and off it, hence in one direction then another.
