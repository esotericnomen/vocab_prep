scurvy (n.)

1560s, noun use of adjective scurvy covered with scabs, diseased, scorbutic (early 15c.), variant of
scurfy. It took on the narrower meaning of Dutch scheurbuik, French scorbut scurvy, in reference to
the disease characterized by swollen and bleeding gums, prostration, etc., perhaps from Old Norse
skyrbjugr, which is perhaps literally a swelling (bjugr) from drinking sour milk (skyr) on long sea
voyages; but OED has alternative etymology of Middle Dutch or Middle Low German origin, as disease
that lacerates the belly, from schoren to lacerate + Middle Low German buk, Dutch buik belly.
