1560s, noun use of adjective scurvy covered with scabs, diseased, scorbutic (early 15c.), variant of
<a href=/index.php?term=scurfy&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>scurfy</a>. It took on
the narrower meaning of Dutch scheurbuik, French scorbut scurvy, in reference to the disease
characterized by swollen and bleeding gums, prostration, etc., perhaps from Old Norse skyrbjugr,
which is perhaps literally a swelling (bjugr) from drinking sour milk (skyr) on long sea voyages;
but OED has alternative etymology of Middle Dutch or Middle Low German origin, as disease that
lacerates the belly, from schoren to lacerate + Middle Low German buk, Dutch buik belly.
