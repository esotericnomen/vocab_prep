c.1500, from Italian arcipelago the Aegean Sea (13c.), from Greek arkhipelagos, from arkhi- chief
(see <a href=/index.php?term=archon&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>archon</a>) +
pelagos sea (see <a href=/index.php?term=pelagic&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>pelagic</a>). The Aegean Sea being full of island chains, the meaning was
extended in Italian to any sea studded with islands. Klein, noting the absence of arkhipelagos in
ancient or Medieval Greek (the modern word in Greek is borrowed from Italian) believe it is an
Italian mistake for Aigaion pelagos Aegean Sea (Medieval Latin Egeopelagus), or influenced by that
name.
