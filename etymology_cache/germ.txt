germ (n.)

mid-15c., bud, sprout; 1640s, rudiment of a new organism in an existing one, from Middle French
germe germ (of egg); bud, seed, fruit; offering, from Latin germen (genitive germinis) sprout, bud,
perhaps from PIE root *gen- to beget, bear (see genus). The older sense is preserved in wheat germ
and germ of an idea; sense of seed of a disease first recorded 1796 in English; that of harmful
microorganism dates from 1871. Germ warfare recorded from 1920.
