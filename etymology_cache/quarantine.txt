quarantine (n.)

1520s, period of 40 days in which a widow has the right to remain in her dead husband's house.
Earlier quarentyne (15c.), desert in which Christ fasted for 40 days, from Latin quadraginta forty,
related to quattuor four (see four).    Sense of period a ship suspected of carrying disease is kept
in isolation is 1660s, from Italian quarantina giorni, literally space of forty days, from quaranta
forty, from Latin quadraginta. So called from the Venetian custom of keeping ships from plague-
stricken countries waiting off its port for 40 days (first enforced 1377) to assure that no latent
cases were aboard. The extended sense of any period of forced isolation is from 1670s.


lazaretto (n.)

house for reception of lepers and diseased poor persons, 1540s, from Italian lazareto place set
aside for performance of quarantine (especially that of Venice, which received many ships from
plague-infested districts in the East), from the Biblical proper name Lazarus. Meaning building set
apart for quarantine is c.1600 in English. The word in Italian was perhaps influenced by the name of
another hospital in Venice, that associated with the church of Santa Maria di Nazaret.
