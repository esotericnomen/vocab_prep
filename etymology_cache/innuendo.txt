innuendo (n.)

1670s, oblique hint, indiscreet suggestion, usually a deprecatory one, from Latin innuendo by
meaning, pointing to, literally giving a nod to, ablative of gerund of innuere to mean, signify,
literally to nod to, from in- at + nuere to nod (see numinous). Originally a legal phrase (1560s)
from Medieval Latin, with the sense of to wit. It often introduced the derogatory meaning alleged in
libel cases, which influenced its broader meaning. As a verb, from 1706.
