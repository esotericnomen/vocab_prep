indenture (n.)

contract for services, late 14c., from Anglo-French endenture, Old French endenteure indentation,
from endenter (see indent). Such contracts (especially between master craftsmen and apprentices)
were written in full identical versions on a sheet of parchment, which was then cut apart in a

be proved by juxtaposition with its counterpart. As a verb, 1650s, from the noun.

from Medieval Latin indentare to furnish with teeth, from in- into, in, on, upon (see in- (2)) +
