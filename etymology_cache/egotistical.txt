class=crossreference>ego</a> + <a href=/index.php?term=-ist&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>-ist</a>. Addison credits the term to Port-Royalists who used it in reference
to obtrusive use of first person singular pronoun in writing, hence talking too much about oneself.
Meaning self-conceit, selfishness is 1800. The -t- is abnornmal, perhaps by influence of <a
