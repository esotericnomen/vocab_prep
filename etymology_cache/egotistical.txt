egotist (n.)

1714, first used by Joseph Addison; see ego + -ist. Addison credits the term to Port-Royalists who
used it in reference to obtrusive use of first person singular pronoun in writing, hence talking too
much about oneself. Meaning self-conceit, selfishness is 1800. The -t- is abnornmal, perhaps by
influence of dogmatism. Related: Egotistic; egotistical.
