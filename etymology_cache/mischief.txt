mischief (n.)

c.1300, evil condition, misfortune, need, want, from Old French meschief misfortune, harm, trouble;
annoyance, vexation (12c., Modern French m&eacute;chef), verbal noun from meschever come or bring to
grief, be unfortunate (opposite of achieve), from mes- badly (see mis- (2)) + chever happen, come to
a head, from Vulgar Latin *capare head, from Latin caput head (see capitulum). Meaning harm or evil
considered as the work of some agent or due to some cause is from late 15c. Sense of playful malice
first recorded 1784.   Mischief Night in 19c. England was the eve of May Day and of Nov. 5, both
major holidays, and perhaps the original point was pilfering for the next day's celebration and
bonfire; but in Yorkshire, Scotland, and Ireland the night was Halloween. The useful Middle English
verb mischieve (early 14c.) has, for some reason, fallen from currency.
