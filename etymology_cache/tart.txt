1887, prostitute, immoral woman, from earlier use as a term of endearment to a girl or woman (1864),
sometimes said to be a shortening of <a href=/index.php?term=sweetheart&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>sweetheart</a>. But another theory traces it to jam-tart (see <a
href=/index.php?term=tart&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>tart</a> (n.1)), which was
British slang early 19c. for attractive woman. Diminutive tartlet attested from 1890. To tart
(something) up is from 1938. Related: Tarted.
