tart (n.2)

1887, prostitute, immoral woman, from earlier use as a term of endearment to a girl or woman (1864),
sometimes said to be a shortening of sweetheart. But another theory traces it to jam-tart (see tart
(n.1)), which was British slang early 19c. for attractive woman. Diminutive tartlet attested from
1890. To tart (something) up is from 1938. Related: Tarted.
