extemporaneous (adj.)

1650s (earlier extemporal, 1560s), from Medieval Latin extemporaneus, from Latin ex tempore (see
extempore). Related: Extemporaneously.


sketch (n.)

rough drawing intended to serve as the basis for a finished picture, 1660s, from Dutch schets or Low
German skizze, both apparently 17c. artists' borrowings from Italian schizzo sketch, drawing, which
is commonly said to be from Latin *schedius (OED compares schedia raft, schedium an extemporaneous
poem), from or related to Greek skhedios temporary, extemporaneous, done or made off-hand, related
to skhema form, shape, appearance (see scheme (n.)). But according to Barnhart Italian schizzo is a
special use of schizzo a splash, squirt, from schizzare to splash or squirt, of uncertain origin.
Extended sense of brief account is from 1660s; meaning short play or performance, usually comic is
from 1789. Sketch-book recorded from 1820. German Skizze, French esquisse, Spanish esquicio are
likewise from Italian schizzo.


fantasia (n.)

musical composition that sounds extemporaneous, 1724, from Italian fantasia, from Latin phantasia
(see fantasy).


toast (v.2)

to propose or drink a toast, 1700, from toast (n.1). This probably is the source of the Jamaican and
U.S. black word meaning extemporaneous narrative poem or rap (1962). Related: Toasted; toasting.
