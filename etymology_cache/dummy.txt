dummy (n.)

1590s, mute person, from dumb (adj.) + -y (3). Extended by 1845 to figure representing a person.
Used in card games (originally whist) since 1736. Meaning dolt, blockhead is from 1796.


baloney (n.)

1894, variant of bologna sausage (q.v.). As slang for nonsense, 1922, American English (popularized
1930s by N.Y. Gov. Alfred E. Smith; in this sense sometimes said to have been one of the coinages of
legendary Variety staffer Jack Conway), from earlier sense of idiot (by 1915), perhaps influenced by
blarney, but usually regarded as being from the sausage, as a type traditionally made from odds and
ends. It also was ring slang early 20c. for an inferior fighter.    The aristocratic Kid's first
brawl for sugar was had in Sandusky, Odryo, with a boloney entitled Young Du Fresne. He gave the
green and nervous Kid a proper pastin' for six rounds and the disgusted Dummy sold me his find for a
hundred bucks, leavin' the clubhouse just in time to miss seein' the boy get stung, get mad, and win
by a knockout. [H.C. Witwer, The Leather Pushers, Colliers, Oct. 16, 1920]
