acme (n.)

highest point, 1560s, from Greek akme (highest) point, edge; peak of anything, from PIE root *ak-
sharp (see acrid). Written in Greek letters until c.1620. The U.S. grocery store chain was founded
1891 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.


acne (n.)

1813, from Modern Latin, from aknas, a 6c. Latin clerical misreading of Greek akmas, accusative
plural of akme point (see acme). The pointed pimples are the source of the medical use.


fine (adj.)

mid-13c., unblemished, refined, pure; of superior quality, from Old French fin perfected, of highest
quality (12c.), from Latin finis end, limit (see finish (v.)); hence acme, peak, height, as in finis
boni the highest good.    In French, the main meaning remains delicate, intricately skillful; in
English since mid-15c. fine is also a general expression of admiration or approval, the equivalent
of French beau (as in fine arts, 1767, translating French beaux-arts). Finer; finest. Fine print is
from 1861 as type small and close-set; by 1934 as qualifications and limitations of a deal.


hammer (n.)

Old English hamor hammer, from Proto-Germanic *hamaraz (cognates: Old Saxon hamur, Middle Dutch,
Dutch hamer, Old High German hamar, German Hammer. The Old Norse cognate hamarr meant stone, crag
(it's common in English place names), and suggests an original sense of tool with a stone head, from
PIE *akmen stone, sharp stone used as a tool (cognates: Old Church Slavonic kamy, Russian kameni
stone), from root *ak- sharp (see acme). Hammer and sickle as an emblem of Soviet communism attested
from 1921, symbolizing industrial and agricultural labor.
