distraught (adj.)

late 14c., alteration (Englishing) of earlier distract (perhaps by association with other past

derange the intellect of, drive mad (see distract).


Alastor

in Greek tradition, son of Neleus, brother of Nestor, slain by Herakles. The name is perhaps
literally not to forget, from privative prefix a- not + root of lathein to forget (see Lethe), hence
its use figuratively in sense of an avenging spirit. Or else it might be connected with alaomai to
wander, roam, figuratively to be distraught.


virginity (n.)

c.1300, from Anglo-French and Old French virginite (state of) virginity; innocence (10c. in Old
French), from Latin virginitatem (nominative virginitas) maidenhood, virginity, from virgo (see
virgin).   Distraught pretty girl: I've lost my virginity!  Benny Hill: Do you still have the box it
came in?


hallucinate (v.)

c.1600, deceive, from Latin alucinatus, later hallucinatus, past participle of alucinari wander (in
the mind), dream; talk unreasonably, ramble in thought, probably from Greek alyein, Attic halyein be
distraught, probably related to alaomai wander about [Barnhart, Klein]. The Latin ending probably
was influenced by vaticinari to prophecy, also to rave. Sense of to have illusions is from 1650s.
Occasionally used 19c. in transitive senses, to cause hallucination. Related: Hallucinated;
hallucinating.
