flail (n.)

implement for threshing grain, c.1100, perhaps from an unrecorded Old English *flegel, which
probably represents West Germanic *flagil (cognates: Middle Dutch and Low German vlegel, Old High
German flegel, German flegel), a borrowing of Late Latin flagellum winnowing tool, flail, from Latin
flagellum whip (see flagellum).


thrash (v.)

1580s, to separate grains from wheat, etc., by beating, dialectal variant of threshen (see thresh).
Sense of beat (someone) with (or as if with) a flail is first recorded 1620s. Meaning to make wild
movements like those of a flail or whip is attested from 1846. Related: Thrashed; thrashing. As a
noun from 1660s, threshing tool; 1840s as a beating; 1982 as the name for a type of fast heavy metal
music.


besom (n.)

Old English besma bundle of twigs (used as a broom or a flail), from West Germanic *besmon
(cognates: Old Frisian besma, Old Saxon besmo, Old High German besmo, German Besen, Dutch bezem), of
unknown origin. Perhaps something bound or twisted, from PIE *bheidh-.


thresh (v.)

Old English &thorn;rescan, &thorn;erscan, to beat, sift grain by trampling or beating, from Proto-
Germanic *threskan to thresh, originally to tread, to stamp noisily (cognates: Middle Dutch
derschen, Dutch dorschen, Old High German dreskan, German dreschen, Old Norse &thorn;reskja, Swedish
tr&#246;ska, Gothic &thorn;riskan), from PIE root *tere- (1) to rub, turn (see throw (v.)).    The
basic notion is of men or oxen treading out wheat; later, with the advent of the flail, the word
acquired its modern extended sense of to knock, beat, strike. The original Germanic sense is
suggested by the use of the word in Romanic languages that borrowed it, such as Italian trescare to
prance, Old French treschier to dance, Spanish triscar to stamp the feet.
