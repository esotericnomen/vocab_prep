filibuster (v.)

1853 in both the freebooting and the legislative senses, from filibuster (n.). Related:
Filibustered; filibustering.


filibuster (n.)

1580s, flibutor pirate, probably ultimately from Dutch vrijbuiter freebooter, a word which used of
pirates in the West Indies in Spanish (filibustero) and French (flibustier) forms, either or both of
which gave the word to American English (see freebooter).    Used 1850s and '60s of lawless
adventurers from the U.S. who tried to overthrow Central American governments. The legislative sense
is not in Bartlett (1859) and seems not to have been in use in U.S. legislative writing before 1865.
Probably the extension in sense is because obstructionist legislators pirated debate or overthrew
the usual order of authority. Not technically restricted to U.S. Senate, but that's where the
strategy works best.


freebooter (n.)

1560s, loan-translation of Dutch vrijbuiter plunderer, robber, from vrijbuiten to rob, plunder, from
vrijbuit plunder, literally free booty, from vrij free + buit booty, from buiten to exchange or
plunder, from Middle Dutch buten, related to Middle Low German bute exchange (see booty). See
filibuster. The back-formed verb freeboot is recorded from 1590s.
