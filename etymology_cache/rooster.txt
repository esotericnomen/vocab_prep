rooster (n.)

1772, agent noun from roost (v.); earlier roost cock, c.1600, in sense of the roosting bird. Favored
in the U.S. originally as a puritan alternative to cock (n.) after it had acquired the secondary
sense penis (and compare roach).


roster (n.)

1727, from Dutch rooster table, list, originally gridiron, from Middle Dutch roosten to roast (see
roast (v.)). So called from the grid of lines drawn on a paper to make a list.


roustabout (n.)

deck hand, wharf worker, 1868, perhaps from roust + about. But another theory connects it to British
dialect rousing rough, shaggy, a word associated perhaps with rooster. With extended senses in U.S.,
including circus hand (1931); manual laborer on an oil rig (1948).


fowl (n.)

Old English fugel bird, representing the general Germanic word for them, from Proto-Germanic *foglaz
(cognates: Old Frisian fugel, Old Norse fugl, Middle Dutch voghel, Dutch vogel, German vogel, Gothic
fugls), probably by dissimilation from *flug-la-, literally flyer, from the same root as Old English
fleogan, modern fly (v.1).    Originally bird; narrower sense of domestic hen or rooster (the main
modern meaning) is first recorded 1570s; in U.S. also extended to ducks and geese. As a verb, Old
English fuglian to catch birds. Related: Fowled; fowling.
