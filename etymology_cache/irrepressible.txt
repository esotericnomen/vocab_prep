Increase of population, which is filling the States out to their very borders, together with a new
and extended network of railroads and other avenues, and an internal commerce which daily becomes
more intimate, is rapidly bringing the States into a higher and more perfect social unity or
consolidation. Thus, these antagonistic systems are continually coming into closer contact, and
collision results.   <br /><br />  Shall I tell you what this collision means? They who think that
it is accidental, unnecessary, the work of interested or fanatical agitators, and therefor
ephemeral, mistake the case altogether. It is an irrepressible conflict between opposing and
enduring forces, and it means that the United States must and will, sooner or later, become either
entirely a slaveholding nation, or entirely a free-labor nation. [William H. Seward, speech at
Rochester, N.Y., Oct. 2, 1858]  </blockquote>  Related: Irrepressibly.
