scruple (v.)

to have or make scruples, 1620s, from scruple (n.). Related: Scrupled; scrupling.


scruple (n.)

moral misgiving, pang of conscience, late 14c., from Old French scrupule (14c.), from Latin
scrupulus uneasiness, anxiety, pricking of conscience, literally small sharp stone, diminutive of
scrupus sharp stone or pebble, used figuratively by Cicero for a cause of uneasiness or anxiety,
probably from the notion of having a pebble in one's shoe. The word in the more literal Latin sense
of small unit of weight or measurement is attested in English from late 14c.


scrupulous (adj.)

mid-15c., from Anglo-French scrupulus, Middle French scrupuleux, or directly from Latin scrupulosus,
from scrupulus (see scruple). Related: Scrupulously; scrupulousness.


qualm (n.)

Old English cwealm (West Saxon) death, murder, slaughter; disaster; plague; torment, utcualm
(Anglian) utter destruction, probably related to cwellan to kill, murder, execute, cwelan to die
(see quell). Sense softened to feeling of faintness 1520s; figurative meaning uneasiness, doubt is
from 1550s; that of scruple of conscience is 1640s.    Evidence of a direct path from the Old
English to the modern senses is wanting, but it is plausible, via the notion of fit of sickness. The
other suggested etymology, less satisfying, is to take the fit of uneasiness sense from Dutch kwalm
steam, vapor, mist (cognate with German Qualm smoke, vapor, stupor), which also might be ultimately
from the same Germanic root as quell.
