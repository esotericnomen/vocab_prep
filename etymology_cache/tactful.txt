tactful (adj.)

1844, from tact + -ful. Related: Tactfully; tactfulness.


diplomatic (adj.)

1711, pertaining to documents, texts, charters, from Medieval Latin diplomaticus, from diplomat-,
stem of diploma (see diploma).    Meaning pertaining to international relations is recorded from
1787, apparently a sense evolved in 18c. from the use of diplomaticus in Modern Latin titles of
collections of international treaties, etc., in which the word referred to the texts but came to be
felt as meaning pertaining to international relations. In the general sense of tactful and adroit,
it dates from 1826. Related: Diplomatically.
