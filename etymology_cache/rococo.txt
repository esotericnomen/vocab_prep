1836, old-fashioned, from French rococo (19c.), apparently a humorous alteration of rocaille
shellwork, pebble-work from Middle French roche rock, from Vulgar Latin *rocca stone. Specifically
of furniture or architecture of the time of Louis Quatorze and Louis Quinze, from 1841. If this is
correct, the reference is to the excessive use of shell designs in this lavish style. For
differentiation, see <a href=/index.php?term=baroque&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>baroque</a>. The general sense of tastelessly florid or ornate is from 1844.
<blockquote>  Much of the painting, engraving, porcelain-work, etc., of the time has ... a real
decorative charm, though not of a very high order in art. Hence rococo is used attributively in
contempt to note anything feebly pretentious and tasteless in art or literature. [Century
Dictionary, 1902]</blockquote>
