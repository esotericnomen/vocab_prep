1520s, mystical interpretation of the Old Testament, later society, small group meeting privately
(1660s), from French cabal, in both senses, from Medieval Latin cabbala (see <a
href=/index.php?term=cabbala&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>cabbala</a>). Popularized
in English 1673 as an acronym for five intriguing ministers of Charles II (Clifford, Arlington,
Buckingham, Ashley, and Lauderdale), which gave the word its sinister connotations.
