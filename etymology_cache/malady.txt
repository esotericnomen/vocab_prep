malady (n.)

late 13c., from Old French maladie sickness, illness, disease (13c.), from malade ill (12c.), from
Latin male habitus doing poorly, feeling sick, literally ill-conditioned, from male badly (see mal-)
+ habitus, past participle of habere have, hold (see habit (n.)). Related: Maladies.


noso-

word-forming element meaning disease, from comb. form of Greek nosos disease, sickness, malady, of
unknown origin.


tarantella (n.)

1782, peasant dance popular in Italy, originally hysterical malady characterized by extreme impulse
to dance (1630s), epidemic in Apulia and adjacent parts of southern Italy 15c.-17c., popularly
attributed to (or believed to be a cure for) the bite of the tarantula. This is likely folk-
etymology, however, and the names of the dance and the spider more probably share an origin in
Taranto, the name of a city in southern Italy (see tarantula). Used from 1833 to mean the style of
music that accompanies this dance, usually in 6/8 time, with whirling triplets and abrupt major-
minor modulations. Related: Tarantism.
