lexicographer (n.)

1650s, from French lexicographe lexicographer, from Greek lexikographos, from lexikon wordbook (see
lexicon) + -graphos writer, from graphein to write (see -graphy).


rasher (n.)

thin slice of bacon or ham, 1590s, of unknown origin. Perhaps from Middle English rash to cut,
variant of rase to rub, scrape out, erase. However, early lexicographer John Minsheu explained it in
1627 as a piece rashly or hastily roasted.


tanner (n.2)

sixpence, slang word first recorded 1811, of unknown origin. J.C. Hotten, lexicographer of Victorian
slang, thinks it may be from tanner and skin, rhyming slang for thin, presumably in reference to the
smallness of the coin. Not to be confused with tenner, slang for ten-pound note, which dates from
1861.


bloviate (v.)

1857, American English, a Midwestern word for to talk aimlessly and boastingly; to indulge in 'high
falutin', according to Farmer (1890), who seems to have been the only British lexicographer to
notice it. He says it was based on blow (v.) on the model of deviate, etc.    It seems to have been
felt as outdated slang already by late 19c. (It was a leasure for him to hear the Doctor talk, or,
as it was inelegantly expressed in the phrase of the period, 'bloviate' .... [Overland Monthly, San
Francisco, 1872, describing a scene from 1860]), but it enjoyed a revival early 1920s during the
presidency of Warren G. Harding, who wrote a notoriously ornate and incomprehensible prose (e.e.
cummings eulogized him as The only man, woman or child who wrote a simple declarative sentence with
seven grammatical errors) at which time the word took on its connection with political speech; it
faded again thereafter, but, with its derivative, bloviation, it enjoyed a revival in the 2000 U.S.
election season that continued through the era of blogging.
