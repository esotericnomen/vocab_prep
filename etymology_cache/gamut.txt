gamut (n.)

1520s, originally, lowest note in the medieval musical scale, in the system of notation devised by
Guido d'Arezzo, contraction of Medieval Latin gamma ut, from gamma, the Greek letter, indicating a
note below A, + ut, the low note on the six-note musical scale that took names from corresponding
syllables in a Latin hymn for St. John the Baptist's Day:<b>Ut</b> queant laxis <b>re</b>sonare
fibris  <b>Mi</b>ra gestorum <b>fa</b>muli tuorum  <b>Sol</b>ve polluti <b>la</b>bii reatum,etc.
Gamut came to be used for the whole musical scale; the figurative sense of entire scale or range of
anything is first recorded 1620s. When the modern octave scale was set early 16c., si was added,
changed to ti in Britain and U.S. to keep the syllables as different from each other as possible. Ut
later was replaced by more sonorous do (n.). See also solmisation.


fa

fourth note in Guidonian scale; see gamut.


la

musical note (sixth note of the diatonic scale), early 14c., see gamut. It represents the initial
syllable of Latin labii of the lips.


ti

do (n.)

first (and last) note of the diatonic scale, by 1754, from do, used as a substitution for ut (see
gamut) for sonority's sake, first in Italy and Germany. U.S. slang do-re-mi money is from 1920s,
probably a pun on dough in its slang sense of cash.
