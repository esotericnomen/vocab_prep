gamut (n.)

1520s, originally, lowest note in the medieval musical scale, in the system of notation devised by
Guido d'Arezzo, contraction of Medieval Latin gamma ut, from gamma, the Greek letter, indicating a
note below A, + ut, the low note on the six-note musical scale that took names from corresponding
syllables in a Latin hymn for St. John the Baptist's Day:<blockquote><b>Ut</b> queant laxis
<b>re</b>sonare fibris  <b>Mi</b>ra gestorum <b>fa</b>muli tuorum  <b>Sol</b>ve polluti <b>la</b>bii
reatum,</blockquote>etc. Gamut came to be used for the whole musical scale; the figurative sense of
entire scale or range of anything is first recorded 1620s. When the modern octave scale was set
early 16c., si was added, changed to ti in Britain and U.S. to keep the syllables as different from
each other as possible. Ut later was replaced by more sonorous do (n.). See also solmisation.
