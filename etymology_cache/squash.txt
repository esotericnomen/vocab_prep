it was the name of the soft rubber ball used in it.

squash (n.1)

gourd fruit, 1640s, shortened borrowing from Narraganset (Algonquian) askutasquash, literally the
things that may be eaten raw, from askut green, raw, uncooked + asquash eaten, in which the -ash is
a plural affix (compare succotash).


squash (v.)

to crush, squeeze, early 14c., squachen, from Old French esquasser, escasser to crush, shatter,
destroy, break, from Vulgar Latin *exquassare, from Latin ex- out (see ex-) + quassare to shatter
(see quash to crush). Related: Squashed; squashing.


zucchini (n.)

1915 in English cookery books, 1910 in travel books about Italy as an Italian word (defined as an
odd kind of little squash, very tender and palatable), from Italian, plural of zucchino, diminutive
of zucca gourd, squash, perhaps from Late Latin cucutia, which is of unknown origin.


squish (v.)

1640s, probably a variant of squash (v.), perhaps by influence of obsolete squiss to squeeze or
crush (1550s). Related: Squished; squishing.


off (adv.)

by c.1200 as an emphatic form of Old English of (see of), employed in the adverbial use of that
word. The prepositional meaning away from and the adjectival sense of farther were not firmly fixed
in this variant until 17c., but once they were they left the original of with the transferred and
weakened senses of the word. Meaning not working is from 1861. Off the cuff (1938) is from the
notion of speaking from notes written in haste on one's shirt cuffs. Off the rack (adj.) is from
1963; off the record is from 1933; off the wall crazy is 1968, probably from the notion of a lunatic
bouncing off the walls or else in reference to carom shots in squash, handball, etc.
