chronique), from Latin chronica (neuter plural mistaken for fem. singular), from Greek ta khronika
(biblia) the (books of) annals, chronology, neuter plural of khronikos of time, concerning time,
from khronos time (see <a href=/index.php?term=chrono-&amp;allowed_in_frame=0

Old English had cranic chronicle, cranicwritere chronicler. The classical -h- was restored in
English from 16c.
