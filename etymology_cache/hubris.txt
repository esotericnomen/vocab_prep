also hybris, 1884, a back-formation from hubristic or else from Greek hybris wanton violence,

hybrid (n.)

c.1600, from Latin hybrida, variant of ibrida mongrel, specifically offspring of a tame sow and a

kriegspiel (n.)

war games played with pieces on maps, 1811 as a German word in English, from German Kriegsspiel,
literally war game, from Krieg war, from Middle High German kriec, combat, mostly exertion, effort;

perhaps from PIE *gwere- (2) heavy (see grave (adj.)) or cognate with Greek hybris violence (see

in British army.
