1580s, from Latin compendium a shortening, saving, literally that which is weighed together, from
compendere to weigh together, from com- together (see <a
href=/index.php?term=com-&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>com-</a>) + pendere to weigh
(see <a href=/index.php?term=pendant&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>pendant</a>).
Borrowed earlier as compendi (mid-15c.).
