bout (n.)

1540s, from Middle English bught, probably from an unrecorded Old English variant of byht a bend,
from Proto-Germanic *bukhta- (see bight (n.)). Sense evolved from a circuit of any kind (as of a
plow) to a round at any kind of exercise (1570s), a round at fighting (1590s), a fit of drinking
(1660s).
