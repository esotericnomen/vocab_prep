hedonist (n.)

1822, in reference to the Cyrenaic school of philosophy that deals with the ethics of pleasure, from
Greek hedonikos pleasurable, from hedone pleasure, related to hedys sweet, cognate with Latin suavis
(see sweet). A hedonist is properly the follower of any ethical system in which some sort of
pleasure ranks as the highest good. The Epicurian identifies this pleasure with the practice of
virtue.
