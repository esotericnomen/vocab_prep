-kratia denoting power of (see <a href=/index.php?term=-cracy&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>-cracy</a>).  <blockquote>  That vast net-work of administrative tyranny ...
that system of bureaucracy, which leaves no free agent in all France, except for the man at Paris
who pulls the wires. [J.S. Mill, Westminster Review XXVIII, 1837]  <br /><br /> <hr /> <br />
