bureaucracy (n.)

1818, from French bureaucratie, coined by French economist Jean Claude Marie Vincent de Gournay
(1712-1759) on model of democratie, aristocratie, from bureau office, literally desk (see bureau) +
Greek suffix -kratia denoting power of (see -cracy).  <blockquote>  That vast net-work of
administrative tyranny ... that system of bureaucracy, which leaves no free agent in all France,
except for the man at Paris who pulls the wires. [J.S. Mill, Westminster Review XXVIII, 1837]   <hr
/>  <b>bureaucrat</b>, &amp;c.; The formation is so barbarous that all attempt at self-respect in
pronunciation may perhaps as well be abandoned. [Fowler]  </blockquote>
