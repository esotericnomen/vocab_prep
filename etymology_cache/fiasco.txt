1855, theater slang for a failure, by 1862 acquired the general sense of any dismal flop, on or off
the stage. Via French phrase fiare fiasco turn out a failure (19c.), from Italian far fiasco suffer
a complete breakdown in performance, literally make a bottle, from fiasco bottle, from Late Latin
flasco, flasconem (see <a href=/index.php?term=flask&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>flask</a>).  <br /><br />  The reason for all this is utterly obscure today,
but the usual range of fanciful theories has been advanced [Ayto]. Weekley finds it utterly
mysterious and compares French ramasser un pelle to come a cropper (in bicycling), literally to pick
up a shovel. OED makes nebulous reference to alleged incidents in Italian theatrical history. Klein
suggests Venetian glass-crafters tossing aside imperfect pieces to be made later into common flasks.
But according to an Italian dictionary, fare il fiasco used to mean to play a game so that the one
that loses will pay the fiasco, in other words, he will buy the next bottle (of wine). That
plausibly connects the word with the notion of a costly mistake.
