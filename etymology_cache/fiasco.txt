fiasco (n.)

1855, theater slang for a failure, by 1862 acquired the general sense of any dismal flop, on or off
the stage. Via French phrase fiare fiasco turn out a failure (19c.), from Italian far fiasco suffer
a complete breakdown in performance, literally make a bottle, from fiasco bottle, from Late Latin
flasco, flasconem (see flask).    The reason for all this is utterly obscure today, but the usual
range of fanciful theories has been advanced [Ayto]. Weekley finds it utterly mysterious and
compares French ramasser un pelle to come a cropper (in bicycling), literally to pick up a shovel.
OED makes nebulous reference to alleged incidents in Italian theatrical history. Klein suggests
Venetian glass-crafters tossing aside imperfect pieces to be made later into common flasks. But
according to an Italian dictionary, fare il fiasco used to mean to play a game so that the one that
loses will pay the fiasco, in other words, he will buy the next bottle (of wine). That plausibly
connects the word with the notion of a costly mistake.


fizzle (v.)

1530s, to break wind without noise, probably altered from obsolete fist, from Middle English fisten
break wind (see feisty) + frequentative suffix -le. Related: Fizzled; fizzling.    Noun sense of
failure, fiasco is from 1846, originally U.S. college slang for failure in an exam. Barnhart says it
is not considered as derived from the verb. The verb in this sense is from 1847.
