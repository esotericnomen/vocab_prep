ballast (n.)

heavy material used to steady a ship, 1520s, from Middle English bar bare (see bare; in this case
mere) + last a load, burden, or borrowed from identical terms in North Sea Germanic and Scandinavian
(compare Old Danish barlast, 14c.). Mere because not carried for commercial purposes. Dutch balg-
last ballast, literally belly-load, is a folk-etymology corruption.
