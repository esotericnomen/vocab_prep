c.1300, spider threads spun in fields of stubble in late fall, apparently from gos goose + sumer
summer (compare Swedish sommertrad summer thread). The reference might be to a fancied resemblance
of the silk to goose down, or because geese are in season then. The German equivalent
m&auml;dchensommer (literally girls' summer) also has a sense of Indian summer, and the English word
originally may have referred to a warm spell in autumn before being transferred to a phenomenon
especially noticable then. Compare obsolete Scottish go-summer period of summer-like weather in late
autumn. Meaning anything light or flimsy is from c.1400. The adjective sense filmy is attested from
1802.
