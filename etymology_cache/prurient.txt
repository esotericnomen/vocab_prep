prurient (adj.)

1630s, itching, later, and now exclusively, having an itching desire (1650s), especially lascivious,
lewd, (1746), from Latin prurientem (nominative pruriens), present participle of prurire to itch; to
long for, be wanton, perhaps related to pruna glowing coals, from PIE root *preus- to freeze; burn
(see freeze (v.)). Related: Pruriently.


obscene (adj.)

1590s, offensive to the senses, or to taste and refinement, from Middle French obsc&#232;ne (16c.),
from Latin obscenus offensive, especially to modesty, originally boding ill, inauspicious, of
unknown origin; perhaps from ob onto (see ob-) + caenum filth. Meaning offensive to modesty or
decency is attested from 1590s. Legally, in U.S., it hinged on whether to the average person,
applying contemporary community standards, the dominant theme of the material taken as a whole
appeals to a prurient interest. [Justice William Brennan, Roth v. United States, June 24, 1957];
refined in 1973 by Miller v. California:    The basic guidelines for the trier of fact must be: (a)
whether 'the average person, applying contemporary community standards' would find that the work,
taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest, (b) whether the work depicts or describes, in a
patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law; and (c)
whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific
value.    Related: Obscenely.


prurience (n.)

1680s, from prurient + -ence. Related: Pruriency (1660s).


pruritus (n.)

itching of the skin without visible eruption [Klein], 1650s, from Latin pruritus, past participle of
prurire to itch (see prurient). Earlier via Old French in form prurite (early 15c.). Related:
Pruritic.
