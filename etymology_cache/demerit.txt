late 14c., from Old French desmerite blame, demerit (Modern French d&eacute;m&eacute;rite), from
des- not, opposite (see <a href=/index.php?term=dis-&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>dis-</a>) + merite merit (see <a
href=/index.php?term=merit&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>merit</a> (n.)). Latin
demereri meant to merit, deserve, from de- in its completive sense. But Medieval Latin demeritum
meant fault. Both senses existed in the Middle French form of the word. Meaning penalty point in
school is attested from 1862.
