demerit (n.)

late 14c., from Old French desmerite blame, demerit (Modern French d&eacute;m&eacute;rite), from
des- not, opposite (see dis-) + merite merit (see merit (n.)). Latin demereri meant to merit,
deserve, from de- in its completive sense. But Medieval Latin demeritum meant fault. Both senses
existed in the Middle French form of the word. Meaning penalty point in school is attested from
1862.
