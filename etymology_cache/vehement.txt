early 15c., from Middle French vehement, veement impetuous, ardent (12c.), from Latin vehementem
(nominative vehemens) impetuous, eager, violent, furious, ardent, carried away, perhaps [Barnhart]
from a lost present middle participle of vehere to carry (see <a
href=/index.php?term=vehicle&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>vehicle</a>). The other
theory is that it represents vehe- lacking, wanting + mens mind. Related: Vehemently.
