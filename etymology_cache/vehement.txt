vehement (adj.)

early 15c., from Middle French vehement, veement impetuous, ardent (12c.), from Latin vehementem
(nominative vehemens) impetuous, eager, violent, furious, ardent, carried away, perhaps [Barnhart]
from a lost present middle participle of vehere to carry (see vehicle). The other theory is that it
represents vehe- lacking, wanting + mens mind. Related: Vehemently.
