ovation (n.)

1530s, in the Roman historical sense, from Middle French ovation or directly from Latin ovationem
(nominative ovatio) a triumph, rejoicing, noun of action from past participle stem of ovare exult,
rejoice, triumph, probably imitative of a shout (compare Greek euazein to utter cries of joy). In
Roman history, a lesser triumph, granted to a commander for achievements insufficient to entitle him
to a triumph proper. Figurative sense of burst of enthusiastic applause from a crowd is first
attested 1831.
