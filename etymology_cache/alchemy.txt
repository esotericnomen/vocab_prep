alchemy (n.)

mid-14c., from Old French alchimie (14c.), alquemie (13c.), from Medieval Latin alkimia, from Arabic
al-kimiya, from Greek khemeioa (found c.300 C.E. in a decree of Diocletian against the old writings
of the Egyptians), all meaning alchemy. Perhaps from an old name for Egypt (Khemia, literally land
of black earth, found in Plutarch), or from Greek khymatos that which is poured out, from khein to
pour, related to khymos juice, sap [Klein, citing W. Muss-Arnolt, calls this folk etymology]. The
word seems to have elements of both origins.<blockquote>Mahn ... concludes, after an elaborate
investigation, that Gr. khymeia was probably the original, being first applied to pharmaceutical
chemistry, which was chiefly concerned with juices or infusions of plants; that the pursuits of the
Alexandrian alchemists were a subsequent development of chemical study, and that the notoriety of
these may have caused the name of the art to be popularly associated with the ancient name of Egypt.
[OED]</blockquote>The al- is the Arabic definite article, the. The art and the name were adopted by
the Arabs from Alexandrians and thence returned to Europe via Spain. Alchemy was the chemistry of
the Middle Ages and early modern times; since c.1600 the word has been applied distinctively to the
pursuit of the transmutation of baser metals into gold, which, along with the search for the
universal solvent and the panacea, were the chief occupations of early chemistry.
