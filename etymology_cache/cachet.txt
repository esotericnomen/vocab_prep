1630s, Scottish borrowing of French cachet seal affixed to a letter or document (16c.), from Old
French dialectal cacher to press, crowd, from Latin coactare constrain (see <a
href=/index.php?term=cache&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>cache</a>). Meaning evolving
through (letter under) personal stamp (of the king) to prestige. Compare French lettre de cachet
letter under seal of the king.
