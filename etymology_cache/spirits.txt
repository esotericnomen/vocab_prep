c.1400, to invoke spirits, from Old French exorciser (14c.), from Late Latin exorcizare, from Greek
exorkizein banish an evil spirit; bind by oath (see <a
href=/index.php?term=exorcism&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>exorcism</a>). Sense of
calling up evil spirits to drive them out became dominant 16c. A rare case where -ise trumps <a

Atlantic, perhaps by influence of exercise. Related: Exorcised; exorcising.
