early 15c., in reference to certain eminent justices of the peace, from Latin quorum of whom,
genitive plural (masc. and neuter; fem. quarum) of qui who (see <a
href=/index.php?term=who&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>who</a>). The traditional
wording of the commission appointing justices of the peace translates as, We have also assigned you,
and every two or more of you (of whom [quoram vos] any one of you the aforesaid A, B, C, D, etc. we
will shall be one) our justices to inquire the truth more fully. The justices so-named usually were
called the justices of the quorum. Meaning fixed number of members whose presence is necessary to
transact business is first recorded 1610s.
