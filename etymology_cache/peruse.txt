peruse (v.)

late 15c., use up, wear out, go through, from Middle English per- completely (see per) + use (v.).
Meaning read carefully is first recorded 1530s, but this could be a separate formation. Meaning read
casually is from 19c. Related: Perused; perusing.


perusal (n.)

c.1600, from peruse + -al (2).


browse (v.)

mid-15c., feed on buds, from Middle French brouster, from Old French broster to sprout, bud, from
brost young shoot, twig, probably from Proto-Germanic *brust- bud, shoot, from PIE *bhreus- to
swell, sprout (see breast (n.)). Lost its final -t in English on the mistaken notion that the letter
was a past participle inflection. Figurative extension to peruse (books) is 1870s, American English.
Related: Browsed; browsing.
