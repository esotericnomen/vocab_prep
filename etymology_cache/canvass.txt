canvass (v.)

c.1500, from alternative spelling of canvas (n.) and probably meaning, originally, to toss or sift
in a canvas sheet, hence to shake out, examine carefully (1520s); to solicit votes (1550s). The
spelling with a double -s- dates from 16c. Compare Old French canabasser to examine carefully,
literally to sift through canvas. Related: Canvassed; canvassing. As a noun related to this,
attested from c.1600.
