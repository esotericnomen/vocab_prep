doggerel

late 14c. (adj.); 1630s (n.), Any rhyming verse in which the meter is forced into metronomic
regularity by the stressing of normally unstressed syllables and in which rhyme is forced or banal
[Miller Williams, Patterns of Poetry]. probably from dog (n.) + pejorative suffix -rel and applied
to bad poetry perhaps with a suggestion of puppyish clumsiness, or being fit only for dogs. Attested
as a surname from mid-13c., but the sense is not evident.
