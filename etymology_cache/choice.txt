mid-14c., that which is choice, from <a href=/index.php?term=choice&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>choice</a> (adj.) blended with earlier chois (n.) action of selecting (c.1300);
power of choosing (early 14c.), someone or something chosen (late 14c.), from Old French chois one's
choice; fact of having a choice (12c., Modern French choix), from verb choisir to choose,
distinguish, discern; recognize, perceive, see, from a Germanic source related to Old English ceosan
to choose, taste, try; see <a href=/index.php?term=choose&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>choose</a>. Late Old English chis fastidious, choosy, from or related to
ceosan, probably also contributed to the development of choice.   Replaced Old English cyre choice,
free will, from the same base, probably because the imported word was closer to <a
href=/index.php?term=choose&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>choose</a> [see note in
OED].
