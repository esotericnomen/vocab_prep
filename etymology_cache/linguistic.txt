1856, from French linguistique (1833); see <a href=/index.php?term=linguist&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>linguist</a> + <a href=/index.php?term=-ic&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>-ic</a>. The use of linguistic to mean of or pertaining to language or
languages is hardly justifiable etymologically, according to OED, but has arisen because lingual
suggests irrelevant associations. Related: linguistically.
