1735, from Modern Latin geologia the study of the earth, from <a

href=/index.php?term=-logy&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>-logy</a>). In Medieval
Latin, geologia (14c.) meant study of earthly things, i.e. law, as distinguished from arts and
sciences, which concern the works of God. Darwin used geologize as a verb.
