nugatory (adj.)

trifling, of no value, c.1600, from Latin nugatorius worthless, trifling, futile, from nugator
jester, trifler, braggart, from nugatus, past participle of nugari to trifle, jest, play the fool,
from nug&aelig; jokes, jests, trifles, of unknown origin.


rowan (n.)

mountain ash, 1804, from rowan-tree, rountree (1540s), northern English and Scottish, from a
Scandinavian source (compare Old Norse reynir, Swedish Ronn the rowan), ultimately from the root of
red, in reference to the berries.    There were those in this neighbourhood, long after the
beginning of the present century, who believed that a slip of rowan tree carried on their person
dispelled glamour, and rendered nugatory all the powers of sorcery and witchcraft. [Alexander Laing,
Lindores Abbey and the Burgh of Newburgh, Edinburgh, 1876]
