mid-13c., from Old French humble, earlier humele, from Latin humilis lowly, humble, literally on the
ground, from humus earth. Senses of not self-asserting and of low birth or rank were both in Middle
English Related: Humbly; humbleness.<blockquote>Don't be so humble; you're not that great. [Golda
Meir]</blockquote>To eat humble pie (1830) is from umble pie (1640s), pie made from umbles edible
inner parts of an animal (especially deer), considered a low-class food. The similar sense of
similar-sounding words (the h of humble was not pronounced then) converged in the pun. Umbles,
meanwhile, is Middle English <a href=/index.php?term=numbles&amp;allowed_in_frame=0

article).
