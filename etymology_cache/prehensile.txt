1771, from French pr&eacute;hensile adapted for grasping (Buffon), from Latin prehensus, past
participle of prehendere to grasp, seize, get hold of, from prae- before (see <a
href=/index.php?term=pre-&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>pre-</a>) + -hendere, from PIE
root *ghend- to seize, take (see <a href=/index.php?term=get&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>get</a> (v.)). Latin -hendere is related to hedera ivy, via notion of clinging.
