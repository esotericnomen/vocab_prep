prehensile (adj.)

1771, from French pr&eacute;hensile adapted for grasping (Buffon), from Latin prehensus, past
participle of prehendere to grasp, seize, get hold of, from prae- before (see pre-) + -hendere, from
PIE root *ghend- to seize, take (see get (v.)). Latin -hendere is related to hedera ivy, via notion
of clinging.
