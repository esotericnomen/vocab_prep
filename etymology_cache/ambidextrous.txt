ambidextrous (adj.)

1640s, with -ous, from ambidexter (adj.) double-dealing (1610s), from French ambidextre or directly
from Latin ambidexter, literally right-handed on both sides, from ambi- both (see ambi-) + dexter
right-handed (see dexterity). Its opposite, ambilevous left-handed on both sides, clumsy (1640s) is
rare. Ambidexter as a noun, one who takes bribes from both sides, is attested from 1530s and is the
earliest form of the word in English; its sense of one who uses both hands equally well appears by
1590s.


ambisexual (adj.)

unisex (of clothing), also bisexual, 1912 in the jargon of psychology, from ambi- + sexual. As a
humorous coinage based on ambidextrous, ambisextrous is recorded from 1929.


ambidexterity (n.)

1650s, from obsolete adjective ambidexter two-sided, using both hands with equal facility, also
double-dealing, from Medieval Latin ambidexter (see ambidextrous) + -ity.
