1640s, with <a href=/index.php?term=-ous&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>-ous</a>, from
ambidexter (adj.) double-dealing (1610s), from French ambidextre or directly from Latin ambidexter,
literally right-handed on both sides, from ambi- both (see <a
href=/index.php?term=ambi-&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>ambi-</a>) + dexter right-
handed (see <a href=/index.php?term=dexterity&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>dexterity</a>). Its opposite, ambilevous left-handed on both sides, clumsy
(1640s) is rare. Ambidexter as a noun, one who takes bribes from both sides, is attested from 1530s
and is the earliest form of the word in English; its sense of one who uses both hands equally well
appears by 1590s.
