stamina (n.)

1670s, rudiments or original elements of something, from Latin stamina threads, plural of stamen
(genitive staminis) thread, warp (see stamen). Sense of power to resist or recover, strength,
endurance first recorded 1726 (originally plural), from earlier meaning congenital vital capacities
of a person or animal; also in part from use of the Latin word in reference to the threads spun by
the Fates (such as queri nimio de stamine too long a thread of life), and partly from a figurative
use of Latin stamen the warp (of cloth) on the notion of the warp as the foundation of a fabric.
