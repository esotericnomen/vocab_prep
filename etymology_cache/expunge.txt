strike (v.)

Old English strican (past tense strac, past participle stricen) pass lightly over, stroke, smooth,
rub, also go, move, proceed, from Proto-Germanic *strikan- (cognates: Old Norse strykva to stroke,
Old Frisian strika, Middle Dutch streken, Dutch strijken to smooth, stroke, rub, Old High German
strihhan, German streichen), from PIE root *streig- to stroke, rub, press (see strigil). Related to
streak and stroke, and perhaps influenced in sense development by cognate Old Norse striuka.
Sense of to deal a blow developed by early 14c.; meaning to collide is from mid-14c.; that of to hit
with a missile is from late 14c. Meaning to cancel or expunge (as with the stroke of a pen) is
attested from late 14c. A Middle English sense is preserved in strike for go toward. Sense of come
upon, find is from 1835 (especially in mining, well-digging, etc., hence strike it rich, 1854).
Baseball sense is from 1853.  To strike a balance is from the sense balance accounts (1530s).
Meaning refuse to work to force an employer to meet demands is from 1768, perhaps from notion of
striking or downing one's tools, or from sailors' practice of striking (lowering) a ship's sails as
a symbol of refusal to go to sea (1768), which preserves the verb's original sense of make level,
smooth.
