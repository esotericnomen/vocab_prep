Frisian grislik horrible, Middle Dutch grisen to shudder, Dutch griezelen, German grausen to
shudder, fear, Old High German grisenlik horrible; of unknown origin; Watkins connects it with the
PIE root *ghrei- to rub, on notion of to grate on the mind. See also gruesome, to which it probably
is connected in some way.
