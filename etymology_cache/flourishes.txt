1957, from no + frills. The expression no thrills meaning without extra flourishes or ornamentation
is in use from 1870s; the original notion probably is of plain clothing.  <blockquote> <b>Man with
no frills</b> (American) a plain person, a man without culture or refinement. An amiable term to
express a vulgar fellow. [Albert Barrere and Charles G. Leland, A Dictionary of Slang, Jargon &amp;
Cant, Ballantyne Press, 1890]  </blockquote>
