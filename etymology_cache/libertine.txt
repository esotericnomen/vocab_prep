libertine (n.)

late 14c., a freedman, an emancipated slave, from Latin libertinus member of a class of freedmen,
from libertus one's freedmen, from liber free (see liberal). Sense of freethinker is first recorded
1560s, from French libertin (1540s) originally the name given to certain Protestant sects in France
and the Low Countries. Meaning dissolute or licentious person first recorded 1590s; the darkening of
meaning being perhaps due to misunderstanding of Latin libertinus in Acts vi:9. As an adjective by
1570s.
