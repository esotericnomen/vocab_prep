debar (v.)

early 15c., to shut out, exclude, from French d&eacute;barrer, from Old French desbarer (12c.,
which, however, meant only to unbar, unbolt, the meaning turned around in French as the de- was felt
in a different sense), from des- (see dis-) + barrer to bar (see bar (n.1)). Related: Debarment;
debarred.
