1828, in part a back-formation from pseudonymous, in part from German pseudonym and French
pseudonyme (adj.), from Greek pseudonymos having a false name, under a false name, from pseudes
false (see <a href=/index.php?term=pseudo-&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>pseudo-</a>)
+ onyma, Aeolic dialectal variant of onoma name (see <a
href=/index.php?term=name&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>name</a> (n.)).  <br /><br />
Possibly a dictionary word at first [Barnhart]. Fowler calls it a queer out-of-the-way term for an
everyday thing. Properly in reference to made-up names; the name of an actual author or person of
reputation affixed to a work he or she did not write is an allonym. An author's actual name affixed
to his or her own work is an autonym (1867).
