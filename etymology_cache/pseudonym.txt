pseudonym (n.)

1828, in part a back-formation from pseudonymous, in part from German pseudonym and French
pseudonyme (adj.), from Greek pseudonymos having a false name, under a false name, from pseudes
false (see pseudo-) + onyma, Aeolic dialectal variant of onoma name (see name (n.)).    Possibly a
dictionary word at first [Barnhart]. Fowler calls it a queer out-of-the-way term for an everyday
thing. Properly in reference to made-up names; the name of an actual author or person of reputation
affixed to a work he or she did not write is an allonym. An author's actual name affixed to his or
her own work is an autonym (1867).
