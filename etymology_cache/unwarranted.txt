unwarranted (adj.)

1570s, from un- (1) not + past participle of warrant (v.).


illegitimate (adj.)

1530s, born out of wedlock, formed in English (and replacing earlier illegitime, c.1500), modeled on
Latin illegitimus not legitimate (see il- + legitimate). Sense of unauthorized, unwarranted is from
1640s. Phrase illegitimi non carborundum, usually translated as don't let the bastards grind you
down, is fake Latin (by 1965, said to date from c.1939) (Carborundum was a brand of abrasives).


adjourn (v.)

early 14c., ajournen, assign a day (for convening or reconvening), from Old French ajourner (12c.)
meet (at an appointed time), from the phrase &agrave; jorn to a stated day (&agrave; to + journ day,
from Latin diurnus daily; see diurnal).    The sense is to set a date for a re-meeting. Meaning to
close a meeting (with or without intention to reconvene) is from early 15c. Meaning to go in a body
to another place (1640s) is colloquial. The -d- was added 16c. but is unwarranted, as the compound
is not from Latin. Related: Adjourned; adjourning.
