outrageous (adj.)

c.1300, excessive, extravagant, from Old French outrageus, outrajos immoderate, excessive, violent,
lawless (Modern French outrageux), from outrage, oltrage (see outrage). Meaning flagrantly evil is
late 14c.; modern teen slang usages of it unwittingly approach the original and etymological sense
of outrage. Related: Outrageously; outrageousness.
