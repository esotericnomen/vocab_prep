guillotine (n.)

The name of the machine in which the axe descends in grooves from a considerable height so that the
stroke is certain and the head instantly severed from the body. [Universal Magazine of Knowledge and
Pleasure, January 1793], 1791, from French guillotine, named in recognition of French physician
Joseph Guillotin (1738-1814), who as deputy to the National Assembly (1789) proposed, for
humanitarian and efficiency reasons, that capital punishment be carried out by beheading quickly and
cleanly on a machine, which was built in 1791 and first used the next year. The verb is first
attested 1794. Related: Guillotined; guillotining.
