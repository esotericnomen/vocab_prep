saga (n.)

1709, an antiquarians' revival to describe the medieval prose narratives of Iceland and Norway, from
Old Norse saga saga, story, cognate with Old English sagu a saying (see saw (n.2)). Properly, a
narrative composition of Iceland or Norway in the Middle Ages, or one that has their
characteristics. Meaning long, convoluted story is from 1857.
