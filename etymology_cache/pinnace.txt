pinnace (n.)

small, light vessel, 1540s, from Middle French pinace (earlier spinace, 15c., from Old French
espinace, Modern French p&#233;niche; also attested as Anglo-Latin spinachium (mid-14c.)); of
unknown origin. The French word perhaps is from Italian pinaccia or Spanish pinaza, from pino pine
tree; ship (Latin pinus pine tree also had a secondary sense of ship, vessel). But variations in
early forms makes this uncertain.
