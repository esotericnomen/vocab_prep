diadem (n.)

late 13c., from Old French diademe and directly from Latin diadema cloth band worn around the head
as a sign of royalty, from Greek diadema, from diadein to bind across, from dia- across (see dia-) +
dein to bind, related to desmos band, from PIE *de- to bind. Used of the headband worn by Persian
kings and adopted by Alexander the Great and his successors.


Taj Mahal (n.)

mausoleum at Agra, India, built by Shah Jahan for his favorite wife, from Persian, perhaps the best
of buildings, with second element related to Arabic halla to lodge. But some authorities hold that
the name of the mausoleum is a corruption of the name of the woman interred in it, Mumtaz (in
Persian, literally chosen one) Mahal, who died in 1631. Persian taj is literally crown, diadem,
ornamental headdress, but here denoting an object of distinguished excellence. Figurative use of Taj
Mahal in English as a name denoting anything surpassing or excellent is attested from 1895.
