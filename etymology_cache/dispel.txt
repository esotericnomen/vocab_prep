dispel (v.)

c.1400, dispelen, from Latin dispellere drive apart, from dis- away (see dis-) + pellere to drive,
push (see pulse (n.1)). Since the meaning is to drive away in different directions it should not
have as an object a single, indivisible thing (you can dispel suspicion, but not an accusation).
Related: Dispelled; dispelling.


Orwellian (adj.)

1950 (first attested in Mary McCarthy), from English author George Orwell (pseudonym of Eric Blair,
1903-1950), especially in reference to his novel Nineteen Eighty-Four. Ironically, it has come to be
used in reference to the totalitarian systems he satirized.It is as if George Orwell had conceived
the nightmare instead of analyzed it, helped to create it instead of helping to dispel its
euphemistic thrall. [Clive James]


resolve (v.)

late 14c., melt, dissolve, reduce to liquid; intransitive sense from c.1400; from Old French
resolver or directly from Latin resolvere to loosen, loose, unyoke, undo; explain; relax; set free;
make void, dispel, from re-, perhaps intensive, or back (see re-), + solvere loosen (see solve).
Early 15c. as separate into components, hence the use in optics (1785). Meaning determine, decide
upon is from 1520s, hence pass a resolution (1580s). For sense evolution, compare resolute (adj.).
Related: Resolved; resolving.


oust (v.)

early 15c., from Anglo-French oster (late 13c.), Old French oster remove, take away, take off;
evict, dispel; liberate, release (Modern French &ocirc;ter), from Latin obstare stand before, be
opposite, stand opposite to, block, in Vulgar Latin, hinder, from ob against (see ob-) + stare to
stand, from PIE root *sta- to stand (see stet). Related: Ousted; ousting.
