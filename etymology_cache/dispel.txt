dispel (v.)

c.1400, dispelen, from Latin dispellere drive apart, from dis- away (see dis-) + pellere to drive,
push (see pulse (n.1)). Since the meaning is to drive away in different directions it should not
have as an object a single, indivisible thing (you can dispel suspicion, but not an accusation).
