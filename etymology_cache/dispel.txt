c.1400, dispelen, from Latin dispellere drive apart, from dis- away (see <a
href=/index.php?term=dis-&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>dis-</a>) + pellere to drive,
push (see <a href=/index.php?term=pulse&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>pulse</a>
(n.1)). Since the meaning is to drive away in different directions it should not have as an object a
single, indivisible thing (you can dispel suspicion, but not an accusation). Related: Dispelled;
dispelling.
