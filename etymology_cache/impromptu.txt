impromptu

1660s (adv.), 1764 (adj.), from French impromptu (1650s), from Latin in promptu in readiness, from
assimilated form of in- into, in, on, upon (see in- (2)) + promptu, ablative of promptus readiness,
from past participle of promere to bring out, from pro- before, forward, for + emere to obtain (see
exempt).


shake-down (n.)

also shakedown, 1730, impromptu bed made upon loose straw, from verbal phrase; see shake (v.) + down
(adv.). Meaning forced contribution (1902) is from the verbal phrase in a slang sense blackmail,
extort (1872). Meaning a thorough search is from 1914; perhaps from the notion of measuring corn.
The oldest use of the verbal phrase shake down is cause to totter and fall (c.1400).


farce (n.)

late 14c., force-meat, stuffing; 1520s, as a type of dramatic work, from Middle French farce comic
interlude in a mystery play (16c.), literally stuffing, from Old French farcir to stuff, (13c.),
from Latin farcire to stuff, cram, of unknown origin, perhaps related to frequens crowded.    The
pseudo-Latin farsia was applied 13c. in France and England to praise phrases inserted into
liturgical formulae (for example between kyrie and eleison), then in Old French farce was extended
to the impromptu buffoonery among actors that was a feature of religious stage plays.
