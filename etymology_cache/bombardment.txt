kitchen sink (n.)

attested by 1824. Phrase everything but (or and) the kitchen sink is 1944, from World War II armed
forces slang, in reference to intense bombardment.    Out for blood, our Navy throws everything but
the kitchen sink at Jap vessels, warships and transports alike. [Shell fuel advertisement, Life,
Jan. 24, 1944]


battery (n.)

1530s, action of battering, from Middle French batterie, from Old French baterie (12c.) beating,
thrashing, assault, from batre beat, from Latin battuere beat (see batter (v.)).    Meaning shifted
in Middle French from bombardment (heavy blows upon city walls or fortresses) to unit of artillery
(a sense recorded in English from 1550s). Extension to electrical cell (1748, first used by Ben
Franklin) is perhaps from the artillery sense via notion of discharges of electricity. In Middle
English, bateri meant only forged metal ware. In obsolete baseball jargon battery was the word for
pitcher and catcher considered as a unit (1867, originally only the pitcher).
