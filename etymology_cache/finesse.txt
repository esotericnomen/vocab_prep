finesse (v.)

1746, originally as a term in whist; see finesse (n.). Related: Finessed; finessing.


finesse (n.)

1520s, from Middle French finesse fineness, subtlety, from Old French fin subtle, delicate (see fine
(adj.)).


fairy (n.)

c.1300, fairie, enchantment, magic, from Old French faerie land of fairies, meeting of fairies,
enchantment, magic, from fae fay, from Latin fata (plural) the Fates, from PIE *bha- to speak (see
fame (n.)).    As a supernatural creature from late 14c. [contra Tolkien; for example This maketh
that ther been no fairyes in Wife of Bath's Tale], perhaps via intermediate forms such as fairie
knight supernatural or legendary knight (early 14c.). The diminutive winged beings so-called in
children's stories seem to date from early 17c.    Yet I suspect that this flower-and-butterfly
minuteness was also a product of rationalization, which transformed the glamour of Elfland into mere
finesse, and invisibility into a fragility that could hide in a cowslip or shrink behind a blade of
grass. It seems to become fashionable soon after the great voyages had begun to make the world seem
too narrow to hold both men and elves; when the magic land of Hy Breasail in the West had become the
mere Brazils, the land of red-dye-wood. [J.R.R. Tolkien, On Fairy-Stories, 1947]     The slang
meaning effeminate male homosexual is first recorded 1895. Fairy ring is from 1590s. Fossil sea
urchins found on the English downlands were called fairy loaves.
