parchment (n.)

c.1300, parchemin (c.1200 as a surname), from Old French parchemin (11c., Old North French
parcamin), from Late Latin pergamena parchment, noun use of adjective (as in pergamena charta,
Pliny), from Late Greek pergamenon of Pergamon, from Pergamon Pergamum (modern Bergama), city in
Mysia in Asia Minor where parchment supposedly first was adopted as a substitute for papyrus, 2c.
B.C.E. Possibly influenced in Vulgar Latin by Latin parthica (pellis) Parthian (leather). Altered in
Middle English by confusion with nouns in -ment and by influence of Medieval Latin collateral form
pergamentum.
