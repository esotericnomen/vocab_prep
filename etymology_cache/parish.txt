parish (n.)

c.1300, district with its own church; members of such a church, from Anglo-French paroche, parosse
(late 11c.), Old French paroisse, from Late Latin parochia a diocese, alteration of Late Greek
paroikia a diocese or parish, from paroikos a sojourner (in Christian writers), in classical Greek,
neighbor, from para- near (see para- (1)) + oikos house (see villa).    Sense development unclear,
perhaps from sojourner as epithet of early Christians as spiritual sojourners in the material world.
In early Church writing the word was used in a more general sense than Greek diokesis, though by
13c. they were synonymous. Replaced Old English preostscyr, literally priest-shire.
