pike (n.2)

weapon with a long shaft and a pointed metal head, 1510s, from Middle French pique a spear; pikeman,
from piquer to pick, puncture, pierce, from Old French pic sharp point or spike, a general
continental term (Spanish pica, Italian picca, Proven&ccedil;al piqua), perhaps ultimately from a
Germanic [Barnhart] or Celtic source (see pike (n.4)). Alternative explanation traces the Old French
word (via Vulgar Latin *piccare to prick, pierce) to Latin picus woodpecker. Formerly the chief
weapon of a large part of the infantry; in the 18th c. superseded by the bayonet [OED]; hence old
expressions such as pass through pikes come through difficulties, run the gauntlet; push of pikes
close-quarters combat. German Pike, Dutch piek, Danish pik, etc. are from French pique.
