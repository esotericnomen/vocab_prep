mid-14c., fact of being lost or destroyed, from Old French perdicion loss, calamity, perdition of
souls (11c.) and directly from Late Latin perditionem (nominative perditio) ruin, destruction, noun
of action from past participle stem of Latin perdere do away with, destroy; lose, throw away,
squander, from per- through (here perhaps with intensive or completive force, to destruction) + dare
to put (see <a href=/index.php?term=date&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>date</a>
(n.1)). Special theological sense of condition of damnation, spiritual ruin, state of souls in Hell
(late 14c.) has gradually extinguished the general use of the word.
