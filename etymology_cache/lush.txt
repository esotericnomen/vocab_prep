Iraq

country name, 1920, from an Arabic name attested since 6c. for the region known in Greek as
Mesopotamia; often said to be from Arabic `araqa, covering notions such as perspiring, deeply
rooted, well-watered, which may reflect the impression the lush river-land made on desert Arabs. But
the name may be from, or influenced by, Sumerian Uruk (Biblical Erech), anciently a prominent city
in what is now southern Iraq (from Sumerian uru city).
