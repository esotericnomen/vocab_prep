drunkard, 1890, from earlier (1790) slang meaning liquor (especially in phrase lush ken alehouse);
perhaps a humorous use of <a href=/index.php?term=lush&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>lush</a> (adj.) or from Romany or Shelta (tinkers' jargon).  <blockquote>
LUSHEY. Drunk. The rolling kiddeys  had a spree, and got bloody lushey; the dashing lads went on a
party of pleasure, and got very drunk. [Dictionary of Buckish Slang, University Wit, and Pickpocket
Eloquence, London, 1811]  </blockquote>
