lumber (n.)

timber sawn into rough planks, 1660s, American English (Massachusetts), earlier disused bit of
furniture; heavy, useless objects (1550s), probably from lumber (v.), perhaps influenced by Lombard,
from the Italian immigrants famous as pawnbrokers and money-lenders in England (see Lombard).
Lumbar, Lumbard were old alternative forms of Lombard in English. The evolution of sense then would
be because a lumber-house (pawn shop) naturally accumulates odds and ends of furniture.
<blockquote>  Live Lumber, soldiers or passengers on board a ship are so called by the sailors.
[Grose, Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue, 1785]   <hr />   LUMBER HOUSE. A house appropriated by
thieves for the reception of their stolen property. [Dictionary of Buckish Slang, University Wit,
and Pickpocket Eloquence, London, 1811]  </blockquote>
