timber sawn into rough planks, 1660s, American English (Massachusetts), earlier disused bit of
furniture; heavy, useless objects (1550s), probably from <a
href=/index.php?term=lumber&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>lumber</a> (v.), perhaps
influenced by Lombard, from the Italian immigrants famous as pawnbrokers and money-lenders in
England (see <a href=/index.php?term=Lombard&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>Lombard</a>). Lumbar, Lumbard were old alternative forms of Lombard in English.
The evolution of sense then would be because a lumber-house (pawn shop) naturally accumulates odds
and ends of furniture.  <blockquote>  Live Lumber, soldiers or passengers on board a ship are so
called by the sailors. [Grose, Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue, 1785]  <br /><br /> <hr /> <br />
LUMBER HOUSE. A house appropriated by thieves for the reception of their stolen property.
[Dictionary of Buckish Slang, University Wit, and Pickpocket Eloquence, London, 1811]  </blockquote>
