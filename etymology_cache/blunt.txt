street slang for marijuana and tobacco cigar (easier to pass around, easier to disguise, and the
stimulant in the tobacco enhances the high from the pot) surfaced c.1993, but is said to have
originated among Jamaicans in New York City in the early 1980s; from Phillies Blunt brand cigars;
see <a href=/index.php?term=blunt&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>blunt</a> (adj.),
which has been used of certain cigars since 19c.<blockquote>Users say that the Phillies Blunt brand
produces less harsh-tasting or sweeter smoke. The leaf wrapper of a Phillies Blunt is strong enough
to hold together through the manipulations of making a blunt. Other brands fall apart.
