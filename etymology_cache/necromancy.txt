pentacle (n.)

1590s, from Medieval Latin pentaculum pentagram, a hybrid coined from Greek pente five (see five) +
Latin -culum, diminutive (or instrumental) suffix. OED notes other similar words: Italian had
pentacolo anything with five points, and French pentacle (16c.) was the name of something used in
necromancy, perhaps a five-branched candlestick; French had pentacol amulet worn around the neck
(14c.), from pend- to hang + a to + col neck. The same figure as a pentagram, except in magical
usage, where it has been extended to other symbols of power, including a six-point star. Related:
Pentacular.
