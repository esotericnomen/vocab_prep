ornithologist (n.)

1670s, from ornithology + -ist.


James

masc. proper name, name of two of Christ's disciples, late 12c. Middle English vernacular form of
Late Latin Jacomus (source of Old French James, Spanish Jaime, Italian Giacomo), altered from Latin
Jacobus (see Jacob).    The Welsh form was Iago, the Cornish Jago. Fictional British spy James Bond
dates from 1953, created by British author Ian Fleming (1908-1964), who plausibly is said to have
taken the name from that of U.S. ornithologist James Bond (1900-1989), an expert on Caribbean birds.
