agnosticism (n.)

1870, from agnostic + -ism.    The agnostic does not simply say, I do not know. He goes another
step, and he says, with great emphasis, that you do not know. [Robert G. Ingersoll, Reply to Dr.
Lyman Abbott, 1890]


agnostic (n.)

1870, one who professes that the existence of a First Cause and the essential nature of things are
not and cannot be known [Klein]; coined by T.H. Huxley (1825-1895), supposedly in September 1869,
from Greek agnostos unknown, unknowable, from a- not + gnostos (to be) known (see gnostic).
Sometimes said to be a reference to Paul's mention of the altar to the Unknown God, but according to
Huxley it was coined with reference to the early Church movement known as Gnosticism (see Gnostic).I
... invented what I conceived to be the appropriate title of 'agnostic,' ... antithetic to the
'Gnostic' of Church history who professed to know so much about the very things of which I was
ignorant. [T.H. Huxley, Science and Christian Tradition, 1889]  The adjective is first recorded
1870.


prosopagnosia (n.)

1950, Medical Latin from German prosopagnosie (1948), from Greek prosopon face (see prosopopeia) +
agnosia ignorance (see agnostic).
