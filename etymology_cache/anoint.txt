c.1300 (implied in anointing), from Old French enoint smeared on, past participle of enoindre smear
on, from Latin inunguere to anoint, from in- on + unguere to smear (see <a
href=/index.php?term=unguent&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>unguent</a>). Originally in
reference to grease or oil smeared on for medicinal purposes; its use in the Coverdale Bible in
reference to Christ (as in The Lord's Anointed; see <a
href=/index.php?term=chrism&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>chrism</a>) has
spiritualized the word. Related: <a href=/index.php?term=Anointed&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
