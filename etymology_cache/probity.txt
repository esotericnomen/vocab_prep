probity (n.)

early 15c., from Middle French probit&eacute;, from Latin probitatem (nominative probitas)
uprightness, honesty, from probus worthy, good (see prove).


honesty (n.)

early 14c., splendor, honor; elegance, later honorable position; propriety of behavior, good
manners; virginity, chastity (late 14c.), from Old French honest&eacute; (Modern French
honn&ecirc;tet&eacute;), from Latin honestatem (nominative honestas) honor received from others;
reputation, character; figuratively uprightness, probity, integrity, virtue, from honestus (see
honest). Meaning moral purity, uprightness, virtue, justness is from c.1400; in English, the word
originally had more to do with honor than honest.
