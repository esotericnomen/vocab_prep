agathist (n.)

1816, from Greek agathos good (see Agatha) + -ist.    Doctor Kearney, who formerly, with so much
reputation, delivered lectures in this place on the history of Rome, observed to me once, that he
was not an optimist, but an agathist; that he believed that every thing tended to good, but did not
think himself competent to determine what was absolutely the best. The distinction is important, and
seems to be fatal to the system of Optimism. [George Miller, Lectures on the Philosophy of Modern
History, Dublin, 1816]
