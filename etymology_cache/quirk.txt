1560s, quibble, evasion, of unknown origin, perhaps connected to German quer (see <a
href=/index.php?term=queer&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>queer</a> (adj.)) via notion
of twisting and slanting; but its earliest appearance in western England dialect seems to argue
against this source. Perhaps originally a technical term for a twist or flourish in weaving. Sense
of peculiarity is c.1600.
