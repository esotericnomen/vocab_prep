enterprising (adj.)

eager to undertake, 1610s, from enterprise. Until mid-19c. (at least in Britain) mostly in a bad
sense: scheming, ambitious, foolhardy. Earlier (1560s) as a verbal noun meaning action of
undertaking.


margarine (n.)

butter substitute, 1873, from French margarine (see margarin). Invented 1869 by French scientist
Hippolyte M&egrave;ge-Mouries and made in part from edible fats and oils.    The enterprising
merchant of Paris, who sells Margarine as a substitute for Butter, and does not sell his customers
by selling it as Butter, and at Butter's value, has very likely found honesty to be the best policy.
That policy might perhaps be adopted with advantage by an enterprising British Cheesemonger. [Punch,
Feb. 21, 1874]
