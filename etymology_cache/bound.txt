bounder (n.)

1560s, one who sets bounds, agent noun from bound (v.1); British English slang meaning person of
objectionable social behavior, would-be stylish person, is from 1882, perhaps from bound (v.2) on
notion of one trying to bound into high society, but earliest usage suggests one outside the bounds
of acceptable socializing, which would connect it with the noun.
