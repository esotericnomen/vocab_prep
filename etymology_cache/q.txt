16th letter of the classical Roman alphabet, from the Phoenician equivalent of Hebrew koph, qoph,
which was used for the more guttural of the two k sounds in Semitic.  <br /><br />  The letter
existed in Greek, but was little used and not alphabetized; the stereotypical connection with -u-
began in Latin. Anglo-Saxon scribes adopted the habit at first, but later used spellings with cw- or
cu-. The qu- pattern returned to English with the Norman Conquest and had displaced cw- by c.1300.
In some spelling variants of late Middle English, quh- also took work from wh-, especially in
Scottish and northern dialects, for example Gavin Douglas, Provost of St. Giles, in his vernacular
Aeneid of 1513:  <blockquote>  Lyk as the rois in June with hir sueit smell  <br />The marygulde or
dasy doith excell.  <br />Quhy suld I than, with dull forhede and vane,  <br />With ruide engine and
barrand emptive brane,  <br />With bad harsk speche and lewit barbour tong,  <br />Presume to write
quhar thi sueit bell is rong,  <br />Or contirfait sa precious wourdis deir?  </blockquote>
Scholars use -q- alone to transliterate Semitic koph (as in Quran, Qatar, Iraq ). In Christian
theology, Q has been used since 1901 to signify the hypothetical source of passages shared by
Matthew and Luke, but not in Mark; in this sense probably it is an abbreviation of German Quelle
source.
