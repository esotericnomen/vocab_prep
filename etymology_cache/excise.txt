excise (n.)

tax on goods, late 15c., from Middle Dutch excijs (early 15c.), apparently altered from accijs tax
(by influence of Latin excisus cut out or removed, see excise (v.)), traditionally from Old French
acceis tax, assessment (12c.), from Vulgar Latin *accensum, ultimately from Latin ad- to (see ad-) +
census tax, census (see census). English got the word, and the idea for the tax, from Holland.
