excise (n.)

tax on goods, late 15c., from Middle Dutch excijs (early 15c.), apparently altered from accijs tax
(by influence of Latin excisus cut out or removed, see excise (v.)), traditionally from Old French
acceis tax, assessment (12c.), from Vulgar Latin *accensum, ultimately from Latin ad- to (see ad-) +
census tax, census (see census). English got the word, and the idea for the tax, from Holland.


excise (v.)

cut out, 1570s, from Middle French exciser, from Latin excisus, past participle of excidere cut out,
cut down, cut off, from ex- out (see ex-) + -cidere, comb. form of caedere to cut down (see -cide).

excision (n.)

late 15c., from Middle French excision (14c.) and directly from Latin excisionem (nominative
