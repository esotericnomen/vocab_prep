tax on goods, late 15c., from Middle Dutch excijs (early 15c.), apparently altered from accijs tax
(by influence of Latin excisus cut out or removed, see <a
href=/index.php?term=excise&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>excise</a> (v.)),
traditionally from Old French acceis tax, assessment (12c.), from Vulgar Latin *accensum, ultimately
from Latin ad- to (see <a href=/index.php?term=ad-&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>ad-</a>) + census tax, census (see <a
href=/index.php?term=census&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>census</a>). English got the
word, and the idea for the tax, from Holland.
