averse (adj.)

mid-15c., turned away in mind or feeling, from Old French avers and directly from Latin aversus
turned away, turned back, past participle of avertere (see avert). Originally and usually in English
in the mental sense, while avert is used in a physical sense.


loath (adj.)

Old English la&eth; hated; hateful; hostile; repulsive, from Proto-Germanic *laithaz (cognates: Old
Saxon, Old Frisian leth loathsome, Old Norse lei&eth;r hateful, hostile, loathed; Middle Dutch
lelijc, Dutch leelijk ugly; Old High German leid sorrowful, hateful, offensive, grievous, German
Leid sorrow; French laid ugly, from Frankish (Germanic) *laid), from PIE root *leit- to detest.
Weakened meaning averse, disinclined is attested from late 14c. Loath to depart, a line from some
long-forgotten song, is recorded since 1580s as a generic term expressive of any tune played at
farewells, the sailing of a ship, etc. Related: Loathness.


lazy (adj.)

1540s, laysy, of unknown origin. Replaced native slack, slothful, and idle as the main word
expressing the notion of averse to work. In 19c. thought to be from lay (v.) as tipsy from tip.
Skeat is responsible for the prevailing modern view that it probably comes from Low German, from a
source such as Middle Low German laisch weak, feeble, tired, modern Low German l&auml;&ouml;sig,
early modern Dutch leuzig, all of which may go back to the PIE root *(s)leg- slack. According to
Weekley, the -z- sound disqualifies a connection with French lass&eacute; tired or German lassig
lazy, weary, tired. A supposed dialectal meaning naught, bad, if it is the original sense, may tie
the word to Old Norse lasenn dilapidated, lasm&oslash;yrr decrepit, fragile, root of Icelandic las-
fur&eth;a ailing, las-leiki ailment. Lazy Susan is from 1917. Grose (Dictionary of the Vulgar
Tongue, 1788) has Lazy Man's Load: Lazy people frequently take up more than they can safely carry,
to save the trouble of coming a second time.
