hide (v.1)

Old English hydan to hide, conceal; preserve; hide oneself; bury a corpse, from West Germanic
*hudjan (cognates: Middle Dutch, Middle Low German huden), from PIE *keudh- (source also of Greek
keuthein to hide, conceal), from root *(s)keu- to cover, conceal (see hide (n.1)). Hide and seek (by
1670s), children's game, replaced earlier all hid (1580s).
