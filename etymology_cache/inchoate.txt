inchoate (adj.)

1530s, from Latin inchoatus, past participle of inchoare, alteration of incohare to begin,
originally to hitch up, from in- on (see in- (2)) + cohum strap fastened to the oxen's yoke.
Related: Inchoative.


choate (adj.)

finished, complete, mistaken back-formation from inchoate (q.v.) as though that word contained in-
not. First attested 1878 in letter from Oliver Wendell Holmes lamenting barbarisms in legal case
writing (he said he found choate in a California report).
