substantiate (v.)

1650s, to make real, to give substance to, from Modern Latin substantiatus, past participle of

factitious).


transubstantiation (n.)

late 14c., change of one substance to another, from Medieval Latin trans(s)ubstantiationem
(nominative trans(s)ubstantio), noun of action from trans(s)ubstantiare to change from one substance
into another, from Latin trans- across (see trans-) + substantiare to substantiate, from substania
substance (see substance). Ecclesiastical sense in reference to the Eucharist first recorded 1530s.


-ate (2)

verbal suffix for Latin verbs in -are, identical with -ate (1). Old English commonly made verbs from
adjectives by adding a verbal ending to the word (such as gnornian be sad, mourn, gnorn sad,
depressed), but as the inflections wore off English words in late Old and early Middle English,
there came to be no difference between the adjective and the verb in dry, empty, warm, etc. Thus
accustomed to the identity of adjectival and verbal forms of a word, the English, when they began to
expand their Latin-based vocabulary after c.1500, simply made verbs from Latin past-participial
adjectives without changing their form (such as aggravate, substantiate) and it became the custom
that Latin verbs were anglicized from their past participle stems.
