(plural corpora), late 14c., from Latin corpus, literally body (see <a
href=/index.php?term=corporeal&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>corporeal</a>). The sense
of body of a person (mid-15c. in English) and collection of facts or things (1727 in English) both
were present in Latin. Corpus Christi (late 14c.), feast of the Blessed Sacrament, is the Thursday
after Trinity Sunday. Also used in various medical phrases, such as corpus callosum (1706, literally
tough body), corpus luteum (1788, literally yellow body).
