antithesis (n.)

1520s, from Late Latin antithesis, from Greek antithesis opposition, resistance, literally a placing
against, also a term in logic and rhetoric, noun of action from antitithenai to set against, oppose,
a term in logic, from anti- against (see anti-) + tithenai to put, place (see theme).


antithetic (adj.)

containing an antithesis, c.1600, from Greek antithetikos setting in opposition, from antithetos
placed in opposition, from antithesis (see antithesis).


antitheses (n.)

plural of antithesis.


demote (v.)

1881, American English coinage from de- + stem of promote. Said to have been Midwestern in origin.
Regarding an antithesis to 'promote,' the word universally in use in Cambridge, in Harvard College,
is drop. The same word is in use in the leading schools here (Boston). I hope I may be counted every
time against such barbarisms as 'demote' and 'retromote.' [Edward Everett Hale, 1892, letter to the
publishers of Funk &amp; Wagnalls' Standard Dictionary]    Related: Demoted; demoting.


antonym (n.)

1867, coined to serve as opposite of synonym, from Greek anti- equal to, instead of, opposite (see
anti-) + -onym name (see name (n.)). Perhaps introduced to English in the book Synonyms and Antonyms
(1867) by the Ven. C.J. Smith, M.A.    UNDER the head of Synonyms and Antonyms, Archdeacon Smith
arranges words which form an antithesis to one another. The word antonym is, we believe, a new
formation but useful. [Journal of Sacred Literature, July 1867]     French antonyme (1842), German
antonym (by 1859) are older. The un-Greek alternative counterterm has been left to fade.
