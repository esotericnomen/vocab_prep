theory of knowledge, 1856, coined by Scottish philosopher James F. Ferrier (1808-1864) from Greek
episteme knowledge, from Ionic Greek epistasthai know how to do, understand, literally overstand,
from epi over, near (see <a href=/index.php?term=epi-&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>epi-</a>) + histasthai to stand, (see <a
href=/index.php?term=histo-&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>histo-</a>).  <br /><br />
The scientific (as opposed to philosophical) study of the roots and paths of knowledge is epistemics
(1969). Related: Epistemological; epistemologically.
