Old English wenian to accustom, habituate, from Proto-Germanic *wanjan (cognates: Old Norse venja,
Dutch wennen, Old High German giwennan, German gew&ouml;hnen to accustom), from PIE *won-eyo-, from
root *wen- (1) to desire, strive for. The sense of accustom a child to not suckling from the breast
in Old English was generally expressed by gewenian or awenian, which has a sense of unaccustom
(compare German abgew&ouml;hnen, entw&ouml;hnen to wean, literally to unaccustom). The prefix
subsequently wore off. Figurative extension to any pursuit or habit is from 1520s.
