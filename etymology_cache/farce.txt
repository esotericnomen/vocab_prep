late 14c., force-meat, stuffing; 1520s, as a type of dramatic work, from Middle French farce comic
interlude in a mystery play (16c.), literally stuffing, from Old French farcir to stuff, (13c.),
from Latin farcire to stuff, cram, of unknown origin, perhaps related to frequens crowded.  <br
/><br />  The pseudo-Latin farsia was applied 13c. in France and England to praise phrases inserted
into liturgical formulae (for example between kyrie and eleison), then in Old French farce was
extended to the impromptu buffoonery among actors that was a feature of religious stage plays.
