nihilist (n.)

1836 in the religious or philosophical sense, from French nihiliste, from Latin nihil (see
nihilism). In the Russian political sense, it is recorded from 1871. Related: Nihilistic.


contrarian (n.)

1963, from contrary + -ian.    To be in opposition is not to be a nihilist. And there is no decent
or charted way of making a living at it. It is something you are, and not something you do.
[Christopher Hitchens, Letters to a Young Contrarian, 2001]
