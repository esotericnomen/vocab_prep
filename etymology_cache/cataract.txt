cataract (n.)

early 15c., a waterfall, floodgate, from Latin cataracta waterfall, from Greek katarhaktes
waterfall, broken water; a kind of portcullis, noun use of an adjective compound meaning swooping,
down-rushing, from kata down (see cata-). The second element is traced either to arhattein to strike
hard (in which case the compound is kat-arrhattein), or to rhattein to dash, break.    Its
alternative sense in Latin of portcullis probably was passed through French to form the English
meaning eye disease (early 15c.), on the notion of obstruction (to eyesight).


Niagara

waterfall from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario, from a town name, perhaps from an Iroquoian language and
meaning a neck (between two bodies of water); general sense of a cataract, torrent is attested from

cataract curls.


glaucoma (n.)

1640s, from Greek glaukoma cataract, opacity of the lens (cataracts and glaucoma not distinguished
until c.1705), from -oma + glaukos, an adjective of uncertain origin (see glaucous).
