early 15c., a waterfall, floodgate, from Latin cataracta waterfall, from Greek katarhaktes
waterfall, broken water; a kind of portcullis, noun use of an adjective compound meaning swooping,
down-rushing, from kata down (see <a href=/index.php?term=cata-&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>cata-</a>). The second element is traced either to arhattein to strike hard (in
which case the compound is kat-arrhattein), or to rhattein to dash, break.  <br /><br />  Its
alternative sense in Latin of portcullis probably was passed through French to form the English
meaning eye disease (early 15c.), on the notion of obstruction (to eyesight).
