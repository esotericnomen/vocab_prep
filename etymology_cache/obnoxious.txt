1580s, subject to the authority of another, from Latin obnoxiosus hurtful, injurious, from obnoxius
subject, exposed to harm, from ob to, toward (see <a href=/index.php?term=ob-&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>ob-</a>) + noxa injury, hurt, damage entailing liability (see <a
href=/index.php?term=noxious&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>noxious</a>). Meaning
subject to something harmful is 1590s; meaning offensive, hateful is first recorded 1670s,
influenced by noxious.<blockquote>Obnoxious has two very different senses, one of which (exposed or
open or liable to attack or injury) requires notice because its currency is now so restricted that
it is puzzling to the uninstructed. It is the word's rightful or de jure meaning, and we may hope
that scholarly writers will keep it alive. [Fowler]</blockquote>  Related: Obnoxiously;
obnoxiousness.
