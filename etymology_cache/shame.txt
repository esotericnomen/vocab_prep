shame (n.)

Old English scamu, sceomu feeling of guilt or disgrace; confusion caused by shame; disgrace,
dishonor, insult, loss of esteem or reputation; shameful circumstance, what brings disgrace;
modesty; private parts, from Proto-Germanic *skamo (cognates: Old Saxon skama, Old Norse sk&ouml;mm,
Swedish skam, Old Frisian scome, Dutch schaamte, Old High German scama, German Scham). The best
guess is that this is from PIE *skem-, from *kem- to cover (covering oneself being a common
expression of shame).    Until modern times English had a productive duplicate form in shand. An Old
Norse word for it was kinnro&eth;i, literally cheek-redness, hence, blush of shame. Greek
distinguished shame in the bad sense of disgrace, dishonor (aiskhyne) from shame in the good sense
of modesty, bashfulness (aidos). To put (someone or something) to shame is mid-13c. Shame culture
attested by 1947.
