comportment (n.)

comport (v.)

late 14c., from Old French comporter endure, admit, behave (13c.), from Latin comportare to bring
together, collect, from com- together (see com-) + portare to carry (see port (n.1)). Meaning to
agree with, suit (with with) is from 1580s. Related: Comported; comporting.


behave (v.)

early 15c., from be- intensive prefix + have in sense of to have or bear (oneself) in a particular
way, comport (compare German sich behaben, French se porter). Cognate Old English compound behabban
meant to contain, and alternatively the modern sense of behave might have evolved from behabban via
a notion of self-restraint. Related: Behaved; behaving.
