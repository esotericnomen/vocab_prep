c.1400, have a morbid craving; early 15c., grow feeble or sick; mid-15c., to fade, fail, give way,
of unknown origin, perhaps from Middle Dutch quelen to suffer, be ill, from Proto-Germanic *kwaljan,
from PIE *gwele- (1) to throw, to pierce (see <a href=/index.php?term=quell&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>quell</a>). Or from obsolete quail to curdle (late 14c.), from Old French
coailler, from Latin coagulare (see <a href=/index.php?term=coagulate&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>coagulate</a>). Sense of lose heart, shrink, cower is attested from 1550s.
According to OED, common 1520-1650, then rare until 19c., when apparently it was revived by Scott.
