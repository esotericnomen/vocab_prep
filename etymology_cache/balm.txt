balm (n.)

early 13c., basme, aromatic substance made from resins and oils, from Old French basme (Modern
French baume), from Latin balsamum, from Greek balsamon balsam, from Hebrew basam spice, related to
Aramaic busma, Arabic basham balsam, spice, perfume.    Spelling refashioned 15c.-16c. on Latin
model. Sense of healing or soothing influence (1540s) is from aromatic preparations from balsam (see
balsam). Biblical Balm of Gilead, however, began with Coverdale; the Hebrew word there is tsori,
which was rendered in Septuagint and Vulgate as resin (Greek rhetine, Latin resina).
