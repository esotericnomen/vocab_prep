disjunction (n.)

c.1400, disjunccioun, from Old French disjunction (13c.) or directly from Latin disjunctionem
separation, noun of action from past participle stem of disjungere (see disjointed).


razzle-dazzle (n.)

1886, American English slang, varied reduplication of dazzle (q.v.).    My confr&#232;re, The
Chevalier, last month gave a new name to the scarfs of disjointed pattern when he called them the
razzle-dazzle. The name was evidently a hit of the most patent character, for in several avenue and
Broadway stores the clerks have thrown out a display of broken figures before me and explained that
the ruling style at present was the razzle-dazzle, and the word seems to have been equally effective
with the public, for when it is quoted by the live salesman, the customer, I am told is at once
interested and caught by it. [Clothier and Furnisher magazine, Jan. 1889]    Meaning state of
confusion is from 1889.
