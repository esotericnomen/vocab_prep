1853, unselfishness, opposite of egoism, from French altruisme, coined or popularized 1830 by French
philosopher Auguste Comte (1798-1857), from autrui, from Old French altrui, of or to others, from
Latin alteri, dative of alter other (see <a href=/index.php?term=alter&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>alter</a>). Apparently suggested to Comte by French legal phrase l'autrui, or
in full, le bien, le droit d'autrui. The -l- is perhaps a reinsertion from the Latin word.
<blockquote>  There is a fable that when the badger had been stung all over by bees, a bear consoled
him by a rhapsodic account of how he himself had just breakfasted on their honey. The badger replied
peevishly, The stings are in my flesh, and the sweetness is on your muzzle. The bear, it is said,
was surprised at the badger's want of altruism. [George Eliot, Theophrastus Such, 1879]
