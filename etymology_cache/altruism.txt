altruism (n .)

1853, unselfishness, opposite of egoism, from French altruisme, coined or popularized 1830 by French
philosopher Auguste Comte (1798-1857), from autrui, from Old French altrui, of or to others, from
Latin alteri, dative of alter other (see alter). Apparently suggested to Comte by French legal
phrase l'autrui, or in full, le bien, le droit d'autrui. The -l- is perhaps a reinsertion from the
Latin word.    There is a fable that when the badger had been stung all over by bees, a bear
consoled him by a rhapsodic account of how he himself had just breakfasted on their honey. The
badger replied peevishly, The stings are in my flesh, and the sweetness is on your muzzle. The bear,
it is said, was surprised at the badger's want of altruism. [George Eliot, Theophrastus Such, 1879]
