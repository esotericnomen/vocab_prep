queasy (adj.)

mid-15c., kyse, coysy, of uncertain origin, possibly from a Scandinavian source, such as Old Norse
kveisa boil, perhaps influenced by Anglo-French queisier, from Old French coisier to wound, hurt,
make uneasy, which seems to be from the same Germanic root as kveisa. But the history is obscure and
evidences of development are wanting. Related: Queasily; queasiness.


nauseous (adj.)

c.1600, inclined to nausea, easily made queasy (obsolete), from nausea + -ous. Sense of causing
nausea or squeamishness is attested from 1610s. For distinction from nauseated see nauseate.
