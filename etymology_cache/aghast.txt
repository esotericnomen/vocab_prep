c.1300, agast, terrified, past participle of Middle English agasten to frighten (c.1200), from a-
intensive prefix + Old English g&aelig;stan to terrify, from g&aelig;st spirit, ghost (see <a
href=/index.php?term=ghost&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>ghost</a>). The -gh- spelling
appeared early 15c. in Scottish and is possibly a Flemish influence, or after ghost, etc. It became
general after 1700.
