aghast (adj.)

c.1300, agast, terrified, past participle of Middle English agasten to frighten (c.1200), from a-
intensive prefix + Old English g&aelig;stan to terrify, from g&aelig;st spirit, ghost (see ghost).
The -gh- spelling appeared early 15c. in Scottish and is possibly a Flemish influence, or after
ghost, etc. It became general after 1700.


flabbergasted (adj.)

1772, mentioned (with bored) in a magazine article as a new vogue word, perhaps from some dialect
(in 1823 flabbergast was noted as a Sussex word), likely an arbitrary formation from flabby or
flapper and aghast.


stupendous (adj.)

1660s, correction of earlier stupendious causing astonishment, astounding (1540s), from Late Latin
stupendus to be wondered at, gerundive of Latin stupere be stunned, be struck senseless, be aghast,
