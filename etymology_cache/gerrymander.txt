gerrymander

1812 as both a noun and verb, American English, from Elbridge Gerry + (sala)mander. Gerry, governor
of Massachusetts, was lampooned when his party redistricted the state in a blatant bid to preserve
an Antifederalist majority. One Essex County district resembled a salamander, and a newspaper editor
dubbed it Gerrymander. Related: Gerrymandered; gerrymandering.
