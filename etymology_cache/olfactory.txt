pilot (n.)

1510s, one who steers a ship, from Middle French pillote (16c.), from Italian piloto, supposed to be
an alteration of Old Italian pedoto, which usually is said to be from Medieval Greek *pedotes

adjective, 1788 as pertaining to a pilot; from 1928 as serving as a prototype. Thus the noun pilot
