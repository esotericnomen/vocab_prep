capacious (adj.)

1610s, able to contain, from Latin capax (genitive capacis) able to take in, from capere to take
(see capable) + -ous. Meaning able to hold much is from 1630s. Related: Capaciously; capaciousness.


blouse (n.)

1828 (from 1822 as a French word in English), from French blouse, workman's or peasant's smock
(1788), origin unknown. Perhaps akin to Proven&ccedil;al (lano) blouso short (wool) [Gamillscheg].
Another suggestion [Klein] is that it is from Medieval Latin pelusia, from Pelusium, a city in Upper
Egypt, supposedly a clothing manufacturing center in the Middle Ages.    In Paris, a very slovenly,
loose, drawn frock, with most capacious sleeves, had been introduced called a blouse. Some of our
priestesses of the toilet seemed emulous of copying this deshabille, with some slight alterations,
but we never wish to see it on the symmetrical form of a British lady. [Summary of Fashion for 1822,
