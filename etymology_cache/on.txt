Old English on, unstressed variant of an in, on, into, from Proto-Germanic *ana on (cognates: Dutch
aan, German an, Gothic ana on, upon), from PIE root *an- on (cognates: Avestan ana on, Greek ana on,
upon, Latin an-, Old Church Slavonic na, Lithuanian nuo down from). Also used in Old English in many
places where we would now use in. From 16c.-18c. (and still in northern England dialect) often
reduced to o'. Phrase on to aware is from 1877. On time is from 1890.
