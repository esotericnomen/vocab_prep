deign (v.)

c.1300, from Old French deignier (Modern French daigner), from Latin dignari to deem worthy or fit
(source of Italian degnare, Spanish de&ntilde;ar), from dignus worthy (see dignity). Sense of take
or accept graciously led to that of condescend (1580s). Related: Deigned; deigning.


disdain (v.)

late 14c., from Old French desdeignier disdain, scorn, refuse, repudiate, from des- do the opposite
of (see dis-) + deignier treat as worthy (see deign). Related: Disdained; disdaining.


impregnable (adj.)

early 15c., imprenable impossible to capture, from Middle French imprenable invulnerable, from
assimilated form of in- not, opposite of (see in- (1)) + Old French prenable assailable, vulnerable
(see pregnable). With intrusive -g- 16c., on model of deign, reign, etc. Related: Impregnability.


reck (v.)

Old English reccan (2) take care of, be interested in, care for; have regard to, take heed of; to
care, heed; desire (to do something) (strong verb, past tense rohte, past participle rought), from
West Germanic *rokjan, from Proto-Germanic *rokja- (cognates: Old Saxon rokjan, Middle Dutch roeken,
Old Norse r&aelig;kja to care for, Old High German giruochan to care for, have regard to, German
geruhen to deign, which is influenced by ruhen to rest).    And in that very moment, away behind in
some courtyard of the City, a cock crowed. Shrill and clear he crowed, recking nothing of wizardry
or war, welcoming only the morning that in the sky far above the shadows of death was coming with
the dawn. [J.R.R. Tolkien, Return of the King, 1955]    The -k- sound is probably a northern
influence from Norse. No known cognates outside Germanic. From its earliest appearance in Eng., reck
is almost exclusively employed in negative or interrogative clauses [OED]. Related: Recked; recking.
