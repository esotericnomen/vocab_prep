abscond (v.)

1560s, from Middle French abscondre and directly from Latin abscondere to hide, conceal, put out of
sight, from ab(s)- away (see ab-) + condere put together, store, from com- together (see com-) +
dere put, from PIE *dhe- to put, place, make (see factitious). The notion is of to hide oneself,
especially to escape debt or the law. Related: Absconded; absconder; absconding.


go south (v.)

vanish, abscond, 1920s, American English, probably from mid-19c. notion of disappearing south to

sconce (n.)

late 14c., candlestick with a screen, a shortening of Old French esconse lantern, hiding place, from
Medieval Latin sconsa, from Latin absconsa, fem. past participle of abscondere to hide (see
abscond). Meaning metal bracket-candlestick fastened to a wall is recorded from mid-15c.


scoundrel (n.)

1580s, skowndrell, of unknown origin. One suggestion is Anglo-French escoundre (Old French escondre)
to hide, hide oneself, from Vulgar Latin *excondere, from Latin condere to hide (see abscond). The
main objection to this theory is that hundreds of years lie between the two words.
