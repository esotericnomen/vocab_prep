incentive (n.)

early 15c., from Late Latin incentivum, noun use of neuter of Latin adjective incentivus setting the
tune (in Late Latin inciting), from past participle stem of incinere strike up, from in- in, into
(see in- (2)) + canere sing (see chant (v.)). Sense influenced by association with incendere to
kindle. The adjective use, in reference to a system of rewards meant to encourage harder work, first
attested 1943 in jargon of the U.S. war economy; as a noun, in this sense, from 1948.
