curmudgeon (n.)

1570s, of unknown origin; the suggestion, based on a misreading of a garbled note from Johnson, that
it is from French coeur mechant evil heart is not taken seriously; the first syllable may be cur
dog. Liberman says the word must have been borrowed from Gaelic (and references muigean disagreeable
person), with variant spelling of intensive prefix ker-. Related: Curmudgeonly.


walrus (n.)

1650s, from Dutch walrus, which was probably a folk-etymology alteration (by influence of Dutch
walvis whale and ros horse) of a Scandinavian word, such as Old Norse rosmhvalr walrus, hrosshvalr a
kind of whale, or rostungr walrus. Old English had horschw&aelig;l, and later morse, from Lapp morsa
or Finnish mursu, which ultimately might be the source, much garbled, of the first element in Old
Norse rosmhvalr.


boulevard (n.)

1769, from French boulevard (15c.), originally top surface of a military rampart, from a garbled
attempt to adopt Middle Dutch bolwerc wall of a fortification (see bulwark) into French, which at
that time lacked a -w- in its alphabet. The notion is of a promenade laid out atop demolished city
walls, a way which would be much wider than urban streets. Originally in English with conscious
echoes of Paris; since 1929, in U.S., used of multi-lane limited-access urban highways. Early French
attempts to digest the Dutch word also include boloart, boulever, boloirque, bollvercq.


garble (v.)

early 15c., to inspect and remove refuse from (spices), from Anglo-French garbeler to sift (late
14c.), from Medieval Latin and Italian garbellare, from Arabic gharbala to sift and select spices,
related to kirbal sieve, perhaps from Late Latin cribellum, diminutive of Latin cribrum sieve (see
crisis). Apparently a widespread word among Mediterranean traders (compare Italian garbellare,
Spanish garbillo); sense of mix up, confuse, distort language (by selecting some things and omitting
others) first recorded 1680s. Related: Garbled; garbling.
