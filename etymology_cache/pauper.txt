pauper (n.)

1510s, person destitute of property or means of livelihood, from Latin pauper poor, not wealthy, of
small means (see poor (adj.)). Originally in English a legal word, from Latin phrase in forma
pauperis (late 15c.) in the character of a poor person, thus allowed to sue in court without legal
fees.
