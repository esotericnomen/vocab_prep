exchequer (n.)

c.1300, from Anglo-French escheker a chessboard, from Old French eschequier, from Medieval Latin
scaccarium chess board (see check (n.1); also see checker (n.2)). Government financial sense began
under the Norman kings of England and refers to a cloth divided in squares that covered a table on
which accounts of revenue were reckoned with counters, and which apparently reminded people of a
chess board. Respelled with an -x- based on the mistaken belief that it originally was a Latin ex-
word.
