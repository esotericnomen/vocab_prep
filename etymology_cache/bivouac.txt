1702, from French bivouac (17c.), ultimately from Swiss/Alsatian biwacht night guard, from bei-
double, additional + wacht guard (see <a href=/index.php?term=wait&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>wait</a> (v.)). Original meaning was an army that stayed up on night watch;
sense of outdoor camp is 1853. Not a common word in English before the Napoleonic Wars. Italian
bivacco is from French. As a verb, 1809, to post troops in the night; meaning camp out of doors is
from 1814.
