bivouac (n.)

1702, from French bivouac (17c.), ultimately from Swiss/Alsatian biwacht night guard, from bei-
double, additional + wacht guard (see wait (v.)). Original meaning was an army that stayed up on
night watch; sense of outdoor camp is 1853. Not a common word in English before the Napoleonic Wars.
Italian bivacco is from French. As a verb, 1809, to post troops in the night; meaning camp out of
doors is from 1814.
