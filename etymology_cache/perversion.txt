late 14c., action of turning aside from truth, corruption, distortion (originally of religious
beliefs), from Latin perversionem (nominative perversio) a turning about, noun of action from past
participle stem of pervertere (see <a href=/index.php?term=pervert&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>pervert</a> (v.)). Psychological sense of disorder of sexual behavior in which
satisfaction is sought through channels other than those of normal heterosexual intercourse is from
1892, originally including homosexuality.<blockquote>Perversions are defined as unnatural acts, acts
contrary to nature, bestial, abominable, and detestable. Such laws are interpretable only in
accordance with the ancient tradition of the English common law which ... is committed to the
doctrine that no sexual activity is justifiable unless its objective is procreation. [A.C. Kinsey,
et.al., Sexual Behavior in the Human Male, 1948]</blockquote>
