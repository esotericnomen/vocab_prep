unkempt (adj.)

1570s, from un- (1) not + kempt well-combed, neat, from variant past participle of Middle English
kemben to comb, from Old English cemban to comb, from Proto-Germanic *kambijan, from *kamb- comb
(see comb (n.)). Form unkembed is recorded from late 14c. The verb kemb is rare after 1400s, but its
negative past participle form endures.
