c.1200, from Old French lecherie impertinence, deceit, from lecheor (see <a
href=/index.php?term=lecher&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>lecher</a>).  <blockquote>
The priests had excellent cause to forbid us lechery: this injunction, by reserving to them
acquaintance with and absolution for these private sins, gave them an incredible ascendancy over
women, and opened up to them a career of lubricity whose scope knew no limits. [Marquis de Sade,
Philosophy in the Bedroom]  </blockquote>
