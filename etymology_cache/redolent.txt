redolent (adj.)

c.1400, from Old French redolent emitting an odor and directly from Latin redolentem (moninative
redolens), present participle of redolere emit a scent, diffuse odor, from red-, intensive prefix
(see re-), + olere give off a smell (see odor).


redolence (n.)

early 15c., from Old French redolence, related to redolent (see redolent).


re-

word-forming element meaning back to the original place; again, anew, once more, also with a sense
of undoing, c.1200, from Old French and directly from Latin re- again, back, anew, against, Latin
combining form concievably from Indo-European *wret-, metathetical variant of *wert- to turn
[Watkins]. Often merely intensive, and in many of the older borrowings from French and Latin the
precise sense of re- is lost in secondary senses or weakened beyond recognition. OED writes that it
is impossible to attempt a complete record of all the forms resulting from its use, and adds that
The number of these is practically infinite .... The Latin prefix became red- before vowels and h-,
as in redact, redeem, redolent, redundant.
