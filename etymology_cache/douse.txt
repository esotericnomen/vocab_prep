douse (v.)

1550s, to strike, punch, which is perhaps from Middle Dutch dossen beat forcefully or a similar Low
German word.    Meaning to strike a sail in haste is recorded from 1620s; that of to extinguish (a
light) is from 1785; perhaps influenced by dout (1520s), an obsolete contraction of do out (compare
doff, don). OED regards the meaning to plunge into water, to throw water over (c.1600) as a separate
word, of unknown origin, though admitting there may be a connection of some sort. Related: Doused;
dousing.
