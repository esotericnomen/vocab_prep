perpetrate (v.)

1540s, from Latin perpetratus, past participle of perpetrare to perform, to accomplish, from per-
completely + patrare carry out, originally bring into existence, from pater father (see father
(n.)). Earlier in English was perpetren, mid-15c., from Old French perpetrer. Neither good nor bad
in Latin, first used in English in statutes, hence its sense of to perform criminally. Related:
