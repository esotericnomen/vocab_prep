1540s, from Latin perpetratus, past participle of perpetrare to perform, to accomplish, from per-
completely + patrare carry out, originally bring into existence, from pater father (see <a
href=/index.php?term=father&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>father</a> (n.)). Earlier in
English was perpetren, mid-15c., from Old French perpetrer. Neither good nor bad in Latin, first
used in English in statutes, hence its sense of to perform criminally. Related: Perpetrated;
perpetrating.
