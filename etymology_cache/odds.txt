odds (n.)

in wagering sense, found first in Shakespeare (2 Henry IV, 1597), probably from earlier sense of
amount by which one thing exceeds or falls short of another (1540s), from odd (q.v.), though the
sense evolution is uncertain. Until 19c. treated as a singular, though obviously a plural (compare
news).
