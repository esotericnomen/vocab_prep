Old English panne, earlier ponne (Mercian) pan, from Proto-Germanic *panna pan (cognates: Old Norse
panna, Old Frisian panne, Middle Dutch panne, Dutch pan, Old Low German panna, Old High German
phanna, German pfanne), probably an early borrowing (4c. or 5c.) from Vulgar Latin *patna, from
Latin patina shallow pan, dish, stewpan, from Greek patane plate, dish, from PIE *pet-ano-, from
root *pete- to spread (see <a href=/index.php?term=pace&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>pace</a> (n.)). Irish panna probably is from English, and Lithuanian pana is
from German.  <br /><br />  Used of pan-shaped parts of mechanical apparatus from c.1590; hence
flash in the pan, a figurative use from early firearms, where a pan held the priming (and the
gunpowder might flash, but no shot ensue).  To go out of the (frying) pan into the fire is first
found in Spenser (1596).
