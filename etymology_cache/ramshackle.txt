1809, back-formation from ramshackled, earlier ranshackled (1670s), alteration of ransackled, past
participle of ransackle (see <a href=/index.php?term=ransack&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>ransack</a>). The word seems to have been Scottish.  <blockquote>  Reading over
this note to an American gentleman, he seemed to take alarm, lest the word ramshackle should be
palmed on his country. I take it home willingly, as a Scotticism, and one well applied, as may be
afterwards shown. [Robert Gourlay, General Introduction to a Statistical Account of Upper Canada,
London, 1822]  </blockquote>  Jamieson's Etymological Dictionary of the Scottish Language (1825) has
it as a noun meaning thoughtless, ignorant fellow.
