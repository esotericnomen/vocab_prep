ramshackle (adj.)

1809, back-formation from ramshackled, earlier ranshackled (1670s), alteration of ransackled, past
participle of ransackle (see ransack). The word seems to have been Scottish.    Reading over this
note to an American gentleman, he seemed to take alarm, lest the word ramshackle should be palmed on
his country. I take it home willingly, as a Scotticism, and one well applied, as may be afterwards
shown. [Robert Gourlay, General Introduction to a Statistical Account of Upper Canada, London, 1822]
Jamieson's Etymological Dictionary of the Scottish Language (1825) has it as a noun meaning
thoughtless, ignorant fellow.


shack (n.)

1878, American English and Canadian English, of unknown origin, perhaps from Mexican Spanish jacal,
from Nahuatl (Aztecan) xacalli wooden hut. Or perhaps a back-formation from dialectal English
shackly shaky, rickety (1843), a derivative of shack, a dialectal variant of shake (v.). Another
theory derives shack from ramshackle.    Slang meaning house attested by 1910. In early radio
enthusiast slang, it was the word for a room or office set aside for wireless use, 1919, perhaps
from earlier U.S. Navy use (1917). As a verb, 1891 in the U.S. West in reference to men who hole up
for the winter; from 1927 as to put up for the night; phrase shack up cohabit first recorded 1935
(in Zora Neale Hurston).
