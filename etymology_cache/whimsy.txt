pedal (n.)

1610s, lever (on an organ) worked by foot, from French p&eacute;dale feet, trick with the feet, from
Italian pedale treadle, pedal, from Late Latin pedale (thing) of the foot, neuter of Latin pedalis
of the foot, from pes (genitive pedis) foot (see foot (n.)).    Extended to various mechanical
contrivances by 1789. Pedal steel guitar is from 1969. Pedal-pushers type of women's trousers
suitable for bicycling is from 1944.    When college girls took to riding bicycles in slacks, they
first rolled up one trouser leg, then rolled up both. This whimsy has now produced a trim variety of
long shorts, called pedal pushers. [Life, Aug. 28, 1944]
