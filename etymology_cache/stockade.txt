1610s, a barrier of stakes, a nativization of Spanish estacada, from estaca stake, from a Germanic

deadline (n.)

time limit, 1920, American English newspaper jargon, from dead (adj.) + line (n.). Perhaps
influenced by earlier use (1864) to mean the do-not-cross line in Civil War prisons, which figured
in the Wirz trial.And he, the said Wirz, still wickedly pursuing his evil purpose, did establish and
cause to be designated within the prison enclosure containing said prisoners a dead line, being a
line around the inner face of the stockade or wall enclosing said prison and about twenty feet
distant from and within said stockade; and so established said dead line, which was in many places
an imaginary line, in many other places marked by insecure and shifting strips of [boards nailed]
upon the tops of small and insecure stakes or posts, he, the said Wirz, instructed the prison guard
stationed around the top of said stockade to fire upon and kill any of the prisoners aforesaid who
might touch, fall upon, pass over or under [or] across the said dead line .... [Trial of Henry Wirz,
Report of the Secretary of War, Oct. 31, 1865]
