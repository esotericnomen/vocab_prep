to cook, late 14c. (earlier to burn, mid-14c.), from Old French bruller to broil, roast (Modern
French br&#251;ler), earlier brusler to burn (11c.), which, with Italian bruciare, is of uncertain
and much-disputed origin.  <br /><br />  Perhaps from Vulgar Latin *brodum broth, borrowed from
Germanic and ultimately related to <a href=/index.php?term=brew&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>brew</a> (v.). Gamillscheg proposes it to be from Latin ustulare to scorch,
singe (from ustus, past participle of urere to burn) and altered by influence of Germanic burn words
beginning in br-. Related: Broiled; broiling.
