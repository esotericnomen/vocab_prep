broil (v.1)

to cook, late 14c. (earlier to burn, mid-14c.), from Old French bruller to broil, roast (Modern
French br&#251;ler), earlier brusler to burn (11c.), which, with Italian bruciare, is of uncertain
and much-disputed origin.    Perhaps from Vulgar Latin *brodum broth, borrowed from Germanic and
ultimately related to brew (v.). Gamillscheg proposes it to be from Latin ustulare to scorch, singe
(from ustus, past participle of urere to burn) and altered by influence of Germanic burn words
beginning in br-. Related: Broiled; broiling.
