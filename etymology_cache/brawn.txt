brawny (adj.)

1590s, characterized by muscle, from brawn + -y (2).


brawn (n.)

late 13c., from Old French braon fleshy or muscular part, buttock, from Frankish *brado ham, roast
or some other Germanic source, from Proto-Germanic *bred-on- (cognates: Old High German brato tender
meat, German Braten roast, Old Norse bra&eth; raw meat, Old English br&aelig;d flesh), from PIE
*bhre- burn, heat, from root *bhreue- to boil, bubble, effervesce, burn (see brew (v.)). The
original sense is piece of meat suitable for roasting. The specific sense 'boar's flesh' is
exclusively of English development, and characteristic of English habits [OED].


braise (v.)

1797, from French braiser to stew (17c.), from braise live coals, from Old French brese embers
(12c.), ultimately from West Germanic *brasa (as is Italian bragia, Spanish brasa), from PIE *bhre-
burn, heat (see brawn). Related: Braised; braising.


bratwurst (n.)

1911, from German Bratwurst, from wurst + Br&auml;t lean meat, finely chipped calf or swine meat,
from Old High German brato (12c.), from Proto-Germanic *bred-on- roast flesh (source also of Old
English br&aelig;de meat), from PIE *bhreue- (see brawn). German folk etymology derives it from
braten to roast, bake, broil, grill; more likely both are from the same ancient source.
