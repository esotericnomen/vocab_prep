stately (adj.)

noble, splendid, late 14c., from -ly (1) + state (n.1) in a sense of costly and imposing display
(such as benefits a person of rank and wealth), attested from early 14c. This sense also is
preserved in the phrase to lie in state to be ceremoniously exposed to view before interment (1705).
