Middle French mignon a favorite, darling (n.), also a term of (probably homosexual) abuse; as an
adjective, dainty, pleasing, favorite, from Old French mignot pretty, attractive, dainty, gracious,
affectionate, perhaps of Celtic origin (compare Old Irish min tender, soft), or from Old High German
minnja, minna love, memory (see mind (n.)). Used  16c.-17c. without disparaging overtones.


mignon (adj.)

delicately formed, 1550s, French, literally delicate, charming, pretty; see minion. As a noun,
pretty child, from 1827.


darling

Old English deorling darling, favorite minion, double diminutive of deor dear (see dear (adj.)). The
vowel shift from -e- to -a- (16c.) is usual for -er- followed by a consonant. It is better to be An
