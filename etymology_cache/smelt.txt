Old English smelt sardine, small salmon-like sea fish, cognate with Dutch smelt sand eel, Danish
smelt (c.1600). OED notes that it has a peculiar odor (but doesn't suggest a connection with <a
href=/index.php?term=smell&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>smell</a>); Klein suggests a
connection with the way the fish melts in one's mouth. Century Dictionary speculates it means smooth
and compares Old English smeolt, smylt serene, smooth.
