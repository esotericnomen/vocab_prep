muse (v.)

to reflect, to be absorbed in thought, mid-14c., from Old French muser (12c.) to ponder, dream,
wonder; loiter, waste time, literally to stand with one's nose in the air (or, possibly, to sniff
about like a dog who has lost the scent), from muse muzzle, from Gallo-Roman *musa snout, of unknown
origin. Probably influenced in sense by muse (n.). Related: Mused; musing.
