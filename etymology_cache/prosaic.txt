prosaic (adj.)

1650s, having to do with prose, from Middle French prosaique and directly from Medieval Latin
prosaicus in prose (16c.), from Latin prosa prose (see prose). Meaning having the character of prose
(in contrast to the feeling of poetry) is by 1746; extended sense of ordinary is by 1813, both from
French.
