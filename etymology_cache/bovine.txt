bovine (adj.)

1817, from French bovin (14c.), from Late Latin bovinus, from Latin bos (genitive bovis) ox, cow,
from PIE *gwous- (see cow (n.)). Figurative sense of inert and stupid is from 1855.


bull (n.1)

bovine male animal, from Old English bula a bull, a steer, or Old Norse boli bull, both from Proto-
Germanic *bullon- (cognates: Middle Dutch bulle, Dutch bul, German Bulle), perhaps from a Germanic
verbal stem meaning to roar, which survives in some German dialects and perhaps in the first element
of boulder (q.v.). The other possibility [Watkins] is that the Germanic root is from PIE *bhln-,
from root *bhel- (2) to blow, inflate, swell (see bole).    An uncastrated male, reared for
breeding, as opposed to a bullock or steer. Extended after 1610s to males of other large animals
(elephant, alligator, whale, etc.). Stock market sense is from 1714 (see bear (n.)). Meaning
policeman attested by 1859. Figurative phrase to take the bull by the horns first recorded 1711. To
be a bull in a china shop, figurative of careless and inappropriate use of force, attested from 1812
and was the title of a popular humorous song in 1820s England. Bull-baiting attested from 1570s.
