prodigal (adj.)

mid-15c., a back-formation from prodigality, or else from Middle French prodigal and directly from
Late Latin prodigalis, from Latin prodigus wasteful, from prodigere drive away, waste, from pro-
forth (see pro-) + agere to drive (see act (v.)). First reference is to prodigial son, from Vulgate
Latin filius prodigus (Luke xv:11-32). As a noun, prodigal person, 1590s, from the adjective (the
Latin adjective also was used as a noun).


prodigality (n.)

mid-14c., from Old French prodigalite (13c., Modern French prodigalit&eacute;) and directly from
Medieval Latin prodigalitatem (nominative prodigalitas) wastefulness, from Latin prodigialis, from
prodigus wasteful (see prodigal).


tun (n.)

large cask, especially one for wine, ale, or beer, Old English tunne tun, cask, barrel, a general
North Sea Germanic word (compare Old Frisian tunne, Middle Dutch tonne, Old High German tunna,
German tonne), also found in Medieval Latin tunna (9c.) and Old French tonne (diminutive tonneau);
perhaps from a Celtic source (compare Middle Irish, Gaelic tunna, Old Irish toun hide, skin). Tun-
dish (late 14c.) was a funnel made to fit into the bung of a tun.    -- That? said Stephen. -- Is
that called a funnel? Is it not a tundish? --  -- What is a tundish? --  --That. The ... the funnel.
--  --Is that called a tundish in Ireland? --  asked the dean. -- I never heard the word in my life.
--  -- It is called a tundish in Lower Drumcondra -- said Stephen, laughing -- where they speak the
best English.--  -- A tundish -- said the dean reflectively. -- That is a most interesting word I
must look that word up. Upon my word I must. --  His courtesy of manner rang a little false, and
Stephen looked at the English convert with the same eyes as the elder brother in the parable may
have turned on the prodigal. [Joyce, Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man]
