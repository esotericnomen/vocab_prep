mid-15c., a back-formation from prodigality, or else from Middle French prodigal and directly from
Late Latin prodigalis, from Latin prodigus wasteful, from prodigere drive away, waste, from pro-
forth (see <a href=/index.php?term=pro-&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>pro-</a>) +
agere to drive (see <a href=/index.php?term=act&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>act</a>
(v.)). First reference is to prodigial son, from Vulgate Latin filius prodigus (Luke xv:11-32). As a
noun, prodigal person, 1590s, from the adjective (the Latin adjective also was used as a noun).
