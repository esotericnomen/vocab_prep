amulet (n.)

mid-15c., amalettys, from Latin amuletum (Pliny) thing worn as a charm against spells, disease,
etc., of uncertain origin, perhaps related to amoliri to avert, to carry away, remove. Not recorded
again in English until c.1600; the 15c. use may be via French.


bill (n.1)

written statement, mid-14c., from Anglo-French bille, Anglo-Latin billa list, from Medieval Latin
bulla decree, seal, sealed document, in classical Latin bubble, boss, stud, amulet for the neck
(hence seal; see bull (n.2)). Sense of account, invoice first recorded c.1400; that of order to pay
(technically bill of exchange) is from 1570s; that of paper money is from 1660s. Meaning draft of an
act of Parliament is from 1510s.


phylactery (n.)

late 14c., small leathern box containing four Old Testament texts, from Old French filatiere (12c.)
and directly from Medieval Latin philaterium, from Late Latin phylacterium reliquary, from Greek
phylacterion safeguard, amulet, noun use of neuter of adjective phylakterios serving as a
protection, from phylakter watcher, guard, from phylassein to guard or ward off, from phylax
(genitive phylakos) guard, of unknown origin. Sometimes worn on the forehead, based on a literal
reading of scripture:Ye shall bind them [my words] for a sign upon your hands, and they shall be for
frontlets between your eyes. [Deut. xi:18]


pentacle (n.)

1590s, from Medieval Latin pentaculum pentagram, a hybrid coined from Greek pente five (see five) +
Latin -culum, diminutive (or instrumental) suffix. OED notes other similar words: Italian had
pentacolo anything with five points, and French pentacle (16c.) was the name of something used in
necromancy, perhaps a five-branched candlestick; French had pentacol amulet worn around the neck
(14c.), from pend- to hang + a to + col neck. The same figure as a pentagram, except in magical
usage, where it has been extended to other symbols of power, including a six-point star. Related:
Pentacular.
