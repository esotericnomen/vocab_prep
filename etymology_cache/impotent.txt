impotent (adj.)

late 14c., physically weak, enfeebled, crippled, from Old French impotent powerless, weak,
incapable, from Latin imponentem (nominative impotens) lacking control, powerless, from assimilated
form of in- not, opposite of (see in- (1)) + ponentem (nominative potens) potent (see potent).
Meaning having no power to accomplish anything is from mid-15c.; that of completely lacking in
sexual power (of males) is from mid-15c. Middle English also had a native term for this: Cunt-beaten
(mid-15c.). The figurative sense in Latin was without self-control, headstrong, violent. Related:
Impotently.


impotence (n.)

early 15c., physical weakness, also poverty, from Middle French impotence weakness, from Latin
impotentia lack of control or power, from impotentem (nominative impotens); see impotent. In
reference to a want of (male) sexual potency, from c.1500. The figurative senses of the word in
Latin were violence, fury, unbridled passion. Related: Impotency.


terrorism (n.)

1795, in specific sense of government intimidation during the Reign of Terror in France (March
1793-July 1794), from French terrorisme, from Latin terror (see terror).    If the basis of a
popular government in peacetime is virtue, its basis in a time of revolution is virtue and terror --
virtue, without which terror would be barbaric; and terror, without which virtue would be impotent.
[Robespierre, speech in French National Convention, 1794]    General sense of systematic use of
terror as a policy is first recorded in English 1798 (in reference to the Irish Rebellion of that
year). At one time, a word for a certain kind of mass-destruction terrorism was dynamitism (1883);
and during World War I frightfulness (translating German Schrecklichkeit) was used in Britain for
deliberate policy of terrorizing enemy non-combatants.
