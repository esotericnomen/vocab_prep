impotent (adj.)

late 14c., physically weak, enfeebled, crippled, from Old French impotent powerless, weak,
incapable, from Latin imponentem (nominative impotens) lacking control, powerless, from assimilated
form of in- not, opposite of (see in- (1)) + ponentem (nominative potens) potent (see potent).
Meaning having no power to accomplish anything is from mid-15c.; that of completely lacking in
sexual power (of males) is from mid-15c. Middle English also had a native term for this: Cunt-beaten
(mid-15c.). The figurative sense in Latin was without self-control, headstrong, violent. Related:
Impotently.
