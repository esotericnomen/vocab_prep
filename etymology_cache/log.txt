log (n.1)

unshaped large piece of tree, early 14c., of unknown origin. Old Norse had lag felled tree (from
stem of liggja to lie), but on phonological grounds many etymologists deny that this is the root of
English log. Instead, they suggest an independent formation meant to express the notion of something
massive by a word of appropriate sound. OED compares clog (n.) in its original Middle English sense
lump of wood. Log cabin (1770) in American English has been a figure of the honest pioneer since the
1840 presidential campaign of William Henry Harrison. Falling off a log as a type of something easy
to do is from 1839.
