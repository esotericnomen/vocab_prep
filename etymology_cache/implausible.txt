implausible (adj.)

c.1600, from assimilated form of in- not, opposite of (see in- (1)) + plausible. Related:
Implausibly.


ofay (n.)

American English black slang, white person, 1925, of unknown origin. If, as is sometimes claimed, it
derives from an African word, none corresponding to it has been found. Perhaps the most plausible
speculation is Yoruba &oacute;f&eacute; to disappear (as from a powerful enemy), with the sense
transferred from the word of self-protection to the source of the threat. OED regards the main
alternative theory, that it is pig Latin for foe, to be no more than an implausible guess.


implausibility (n.)

1630s; see implausible + -ity.


indri (n.)

1839, European name for the babakoto, a lemur-like arboreal primate of Madagascar (Indris
Lichanotus); the common story since late 19c. is that the name was given in error by French
naturalist Pierre Sonnerat (1748-1814), c.1780, from mistaken use of Malagasy indry! look! See!
Evidently this was what his native guides said when they spotted the creature and called his
attention to it.    However, as Hacking (1981) pointed out, Sonnerat was far too familiar with
indris -- he described and figured them in detail, and apparently kept at least one in captivity --
for this story to be plausible. Furthermore, endrina is actually recorded as a native name for the
indri (Cousins, 1885), and indri could easily be a variant of this name. Although the word endrina
is first recorded in Malagasy only in 1835, there is no evidence that it could be a back-formation
from the French indri (Hacking, 1981), and it seems implausible that the Malagasy would adopt an
erroneous French name for an animal they were them selves familiar with. [Dunkel, Alexander R., et
