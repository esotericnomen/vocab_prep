kindred (n.)

c.1200, kinraden, compound of kin (q.v.) + -rede, from Old English r&aelig;den condition, rule,
related to r&aelig;dan to advise, rule (see read (v.)). With intrusive -d- (17c.) probably for
phonetic reasons (compare thunder) but perhaps encouraged by kind (n.). As an adjective, 1520s, from
the noun.
