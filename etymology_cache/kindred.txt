c.1200, kinraden, compound of <a href=/index.php?term=kin&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>kin</a> (q.v.) + -rede, from Old English r&aelig;den condition, rule, related
to r&aelig;dan to advise, rule (see <a href=/index.php?term=read&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>read</a> (v.)). With intrusive -d- (17c.) probably for phonetic reasons
(compare <a href=/index.php?term=thunder&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>thunder</a>)
but perhaps encouraged by kind (n.). As an adjective, 1520s, from the noun.
