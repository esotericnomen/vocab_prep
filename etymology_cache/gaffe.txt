blunder, 1909, perhaps from French gaffe clumsy remark, originally boat hook, from Middle French
gaffe (15c.), from Old Proven&ccedil;al gaf, probably from a Germanic source, from Proto-Germanic
*gafa. Sense connection is obscure; the gaff was used to land big fish. Or it may derive from
British slang gaff to cheat, trick (1893); or gaff criticism (1896), from Scottish dialect sense of
loud, rude talk (see <a href=/index.php?term=gaff&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>gaff</a> (n.2)).
