gaffe (n.)

blunder, 1909, perhaps from French gaffe clumsy remark, originally boat hook, from Middle French
gaffe (15c.), from Old Proven&ccedil;al gaf, probably from a Germanic source, from Proto-Germanic
*gafa. Sense connection is obscure; the gaff was used to land big fish. Or it may derive from
British slang gaff to cheat, trick (1893); or gaff criticism (1896), from Scottish dialect sense of
loud, rude talk (see gaff (n.2)).


gaff (n.1)

iron hook, c.1300, gaffe, from Old French gaffe boat hook (see gaffe). Specifically of the hook on a
fishing spear from 1650s.


gaff (n.2)

loud, rude talk, 1825, from Scottish dialect, perhaps a survival of Old English gafspr&aelig;c
blasphemous or ribald speech, or from gaff (n.1), and compare gaffe.


goof (n.)

1916, American English, stupid person, perhaps a variant of English dialect goff foolish clown
(1869), from 16c. goffe, probably from Middle French goffe awkward, stupid, of uncertain origin. Or
English goffe may be from Middle English goffen speak in a frivolous manner, possibly from Old
English gegaf buffoonery, and gaffetung scolding. Sense of a blunder is c.1954, probably influenced
by gaffe.
