c.1300, soft, tender, from Old French souple, sople pliant, flexible; humble, submissive (12c.),
from Gallo-Roman *supples, from Latin supplex submissive, humbly begging, beseeching, kneeling in
entreaty, literally bending, kneeling down, perhaps an altered form of *supplacos humbly pleading,
appeasing, from sub under + placare appease (see <a
href=/index.php?term=placate&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>placate</a>). Meaning
pliant is from late 14c.; figurative sense of artfully obsequious, capable of adapting oneself to
the wishes and opinions of others is from c.1600. Supple-chapped (c.1600) was used of a flatterer.
