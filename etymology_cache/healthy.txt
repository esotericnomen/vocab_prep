healthy (adj.)

1550s, from health + -y (2). Slightly earlier in the same sense was healthsome (1530s). Related:
Healthiness.  <blockquote>  It is wrong to say that certain articles of food are healthy or
unhealthy. Wholesome and unwholesome are the right words. A pig may be healthy or unhealthy while
alive; but after he is killed and becomes pork, he can enjoy no health, and suffer no sickness.
[Eliza Leslie, Miss Leslie's Behaviour Book, Philadelphia, 1839]  </blockquote>
