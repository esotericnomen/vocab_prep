opening, Old English h&aelig;c (genitive h&aelig;cce) fence, grating, gate, from Proto-Germanic
*hak- (cognates: Middle High German heck, Dutch hek fence, gate). This apparently is the source of
many of the Hatcher surnames; one who lives near a gate. Sense of plank opening in ship's deck is
first recorded mid-13c. Drinking phrase down the hatch first recorded 1931.
