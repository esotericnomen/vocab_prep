consign (v.)

early 15c., to ratify by a sign or seal, from Middle French consigner (15c.), from Latin consignare
to seal, register, originally to mark with a sign, from com- together (see com-) + signare to sign,
mark, from signum sign (see sign (n.)). Commercial sense is from 1650s. Related: Consignee;

remand (v.)

mid-15c., from Middle French remander send for again (12c.) or directly from Late Latin remandare to
send back word, repeat a command, from Latin re- back (see re-) + mandare to consign, order, commit
to one's charge (see mandate (n.)). Specifically in law, send back (a prisoner) on refusing an
application for discharge. Related: Remanded; remanding.


infralapsarian (adj.)

1731, from infra- + Latin lapsus a fall (see lapse (n.)) + ending from unitarian, etc. In reference
to the Calvinist doctrine that god's election of some to everlasting life was consequent to his
decree to allow the Fall of man, and was thus a remedial measure. Contrasted to supralapsarian, in
reference to the belief that He always meant to consign most of mankind to eternal fire and that the
decision to create some men to be damned was his first decree. There's also a moderate sublapsarian
view. Here the decree to elect those who would believe and leave those who do not believe to
damnation also comes after the decree to allow the fall, but the decree to provide salvation for man
comes immediately after the decree to elect.
