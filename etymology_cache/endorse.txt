endorse (v.)

late 14c. endosse alteration, from Old French endosser (12c.), literally to put on back, from en-
put on (see en- (1)) + dos back, from Latin dossum, variant of dorsum.    Sense of confirm, approve
(by signing on the back) is recorded in English first in 1847. Assimilated 16c. in form to Medieval
Latin indorsare. Related: Endorsed; endorsing.  <blockquote>  You can endorse, literally, a cheque
or other papers, &amp;, metaphorically, a claim or argument, but to talk of endorsing material
things other than papers is a solecism. [Fowler]  </blockquote>
