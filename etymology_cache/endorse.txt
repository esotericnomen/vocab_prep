late 14c. endosse alteration, from Old French endosser (12c.), literally to put on back, from en-
put on (see <a href=/index.php?term=en-&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>en-</a> (1)) +
dos back, from Latin dossum, variant of dorsum.  <br /><br />  Sense of confirm, approve (by signing
on the back) is recorded in English first in 1847. Assimilated 16c. in form to Medieval Latin
indorsare. Related: Endorsed; endorsing.  <blockquote>  You can endorse, literally, a cheque or
other papers, &amp;, metaphorically, a claim or argument, but to talk of endorsing material things
other than papers is a solecism. [Fowler]  </blockquote>
