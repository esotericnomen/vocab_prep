gable (n.)

mid-14c., from Old French gable facade, front, gable, from Old Norse gafl gable, gable-end (in north
of England, the word probably is directly from Norse), probably from Proto-Germanic *gablaz top of a
pitched roof (cognates: Middle Dutch ghevel, Dutch gevel, Old High German gibil, German Giebel,
Gothic gibla gable), from PIE *ghebhel.    Cognates seem to be words meaning both fork (such as Old
English gafol, geafel, Old Saxon gafala, Dutch gaffel, Old High German gabala pitchfork, German
Gabel fork; Old Irish gabul forked twig) and head (such as Old High German gibilla, Old Saxon
gibillia skull).    Possibly the primitive meaning of the words may have been 'top', 'vertex'; this
may have given rise to the sense of 'gable', and this latter to the sense of 'fork', a gable being
originally formed by two pieces of timber crossed at the top supporting the end of the roof-tree.
