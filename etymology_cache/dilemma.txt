1520s, from Late Latin dilemma, from Greek dilemma double proposition, a technical term in rhetoric,
from di- two + lemma premise, anything received or taken, from root of lambanein to take (see <a
href=/index.php?term=analemma&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>analemma</a>). It should
be used only of situations where someone is forced to choose between two alternatives, both
unfavorable to him. But even logicians disagree on whether certain situations are dilemmas or mere
syllogisms.
