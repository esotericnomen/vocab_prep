prosody (n.)

late 15c., from Latin prosodia accent of a syllable, from Greek prosoidia song sung to music, also
accent, modulation, literally a singing in addition to, from pros to, forward, near + oide song,
poem (see ode). Related: Prosodiacal; prosodist.


Gradus ad Parnassum

Latin, literally A Step to Parnassus, mountain sacred to Apollo and the Muses, title of a dictionary
of prosody used in English public schools for centuries as a guide to Roman poetry. The book dates
from the 1680s.


metric (n.)

science of versification, 1760, from Greek he metrike prosody, plural of metron meter, a verse; that
by which anything is measured; measure, length, size, limit, proportion (see meter (n.2)).


mechanization (n.)

1834, from mechanize + -ation.    In our country, the ancient languages are studied, to a sad
extent, as a mere exercise in the technics of etymology, syntax and prosody; and when thus pursued,
there can be no good reason for so great a sacrifice of time and labor, or for that mechanization
(if we may make a term) of mind which is the natural result. [American Annals of Education and
Instruction, December 1834]


assonance (n.)

1727, resemblance of sounds between words, from French assonance, from assonant, from Latin
assonantem (nominative assonans), present participle of assonare to resound, respond to, from ad- to
(see ad-) + sonare to sound (see sonata). Properly, in prosody, rhyming of accented vowels, but not
consonants (1823).


dieresis (n.)

also diaeresis, 1610s, sign marking the division of a diphthong into two simple sounds, from Late
Latin diaeresis, from Greek diairesis division, noun of action from diairein to divide, separate,
from dia- apart (see dia-) + hairein to take (see heresy). In classical prosody, the slight break in
the forward motion of a line that is felt when the end of a foot coincides with the end of a word
[Miller Williams, Patterns of Poetry].
