tycoon (n.)

1857, title given by foreigners to the shogun of Japan (said to have been used by his supporters
when addressing foreigners, as an attempt to convey that the shogun was more important than the
emperor), from Japanese taikun great lord or prince, from Chinese tai great + kiun lord. Transferred
meaning important person is attested from 1861, in reference to U.S. president Abraham Lincoln (in
the diary of his secretary, John Hay); specific application to wealthy and powerful businessman is
post-World War I.
