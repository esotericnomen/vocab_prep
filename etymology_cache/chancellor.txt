chancellor (n.)

early 12c., from Old French chancelier (12c.), from Late Latin cancellarius keeper of the barrier,
secretary, usher of a law court, so called because he worked behind a lattice (Latin cancellus) at a
basilica or law court (see chancel). In the Roman Empire, a sort of court usher; the post gradually
gained importance in the Western kingdoms. A variant form, canceler, existed in Old English, from
Old North French, but was replaced by this central French form.
