tenant (n.)

early 14c., person who holds lands by title or by lease, from Anglo-French tenaunt (late 13c.), Old
French tenant possessor; feudal tenant (12c.), noun use of present participle of tenir to hold, from
Latin tenere hold, keep, grasp (see tenet). Related: Tenancy. Tenant-farmer attested from 1748.


cottage (n.)

late 13c., from Old French cote hut, cottage + Anglo-French suffix -age (probably denoting the
entire property attached to a cote). Old French cot is probably from Old Norse kot hut, cognate of
Old English cot, cote cottage, hut, from Proto-Germanic *kutan (cognates: Middle Dutch cot, Dutch
kot).    Meaning small country residence (without suggestion of poverty or tenancy) is from 1765.
Modern French cottage is a 19c. reborrowing from English. Cottage industry is attested from 1921.
Cottage cheese is attested from 1831, American English, earliest in reference to Philadelphia:
There was a plate of rye-bread, and a plate of wheat, and a basket of crackers; another plate with
half a dozen paltry cakes that looked as if they had been bought under the old Court House; some
morsels of dried beef on two little tea-cup plates: and a small glass dish of that preparation of
curds, which in vulgar language is called smear-case, but whose nom de guerre is cottage-cheese, at
least that was the appellation given it by our hostess. [Miss Leslie, Country Lodgings, Godey's
Lady's Book, July 1831]
