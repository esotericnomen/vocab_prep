to touch, c.1600, perhaps a transferred sense from <a
href=/index.php?term=graze&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>graze</a> (v.1) via a notion
of cropping grass right down to the ground (compare German grasen to feed on grass, used in military
sense in reference to cannonballs that rebound off the ground). Related: Grazed; grazing. As a noun
from 1690s.
