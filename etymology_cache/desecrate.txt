desecrate (v.)

1670s, formed from de- do the opposite of (see de-) + stem of consecrate. Old French had dessacrer
to profane, and there is a similar formation in Italian; but Latin desecrare meant to make holy,
with de- in this case having a completive sense. Related: Desecrated; desecrating.


desecration (n.)

1717, noun of action from desecrate (v.).


profane (v.)

late 14c., from Old French profaner, prophaner (13c.) and directly from Latin profanare to
desecrate, render unholy, violate, from profanus unholy, not consecrated (see profane (adj.)).
Related: Profaned; profaning.


defile (v.)

c.1400, to desecrate, profane; mid-15c., to make foul or dirty, alteration of earlier defoulen, from
Old French defouler trample down, violate, also ill-treat, dishonor, from de- down (see de-) + foler
to tread, from Latin fullo person who cleans and thickens cloth by stamping on it  (see foil (v.)).
The alteration (or re-formation) in English is from influence of Middle English filen (v.) to render
foul; make unclean or impure, literal and figurative, from Old English fylen (trans.), related to
Old English fulian (intrans.) to become foul, rot, from the source of foul (adj.). Compare befoul,
which also had a parallel form befilen. Related: Defiled; defiling.
