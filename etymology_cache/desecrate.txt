1670s, formed from de- do the opposite of (see <a href=/index.php?term=de-&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>de-</a>) + stem of <a href=/index.php?term=consecrate&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>consecrate</a>. Old French had dessacrer to profane, and there is a similar
formation in Italian; but Latin desecrare meant to make holy, with de- in this case having a
completive sense. Related: Desecrated; desecrating.
