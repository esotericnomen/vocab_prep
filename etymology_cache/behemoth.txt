behemoth (n.)

late 14c., huge biblical beast (Job xl:15), from Latin behemoth, from Hebrew b'hemoth, usually taken
as plural of intensity of b'hemah beast. But the Hebrew word is perhaps a folk etymology of Egyptian
pehemau, literally water-ox, the name for the hippopotamus.  <blockquote>  Long before Jumbo was
dreamed of, a hippo was exhibited by George K. Bailey, who invented the tank on wheels now used so
generally in the circuses. The beast was advertised as the blood sweating Behemoth of Holy Writ, and
he made several men rich. [Isaac F. Marcosson, Sawdust and Gold Dust, in The Bookman, June 1910]
