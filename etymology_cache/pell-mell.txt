confusedly, 1570s, from Middle French p&ecirc;le-m&ecirc;le, from Old French pesle mesle (12c.),
apparently a jingling rhyme on the second element, which is from the stem of the verb mesler to mix,
mingle (see <a href=/index.php?term=meddle&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>meddle</a>).
Phonetic French form pelly melly is attested in English from mid-15c.
