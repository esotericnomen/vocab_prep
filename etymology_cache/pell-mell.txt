pell-mell (adv.)

confusedly, 1570s, from Middle French p&ecirc;le-m&ecirc;le, from Old French pesle mesle (12c.),
apparently a jingling rhyme on the second element, which is from the stem of the verb mesler to mix,
mingle (see meddle). Phonetic French form pelly melly is attested in English from mid-15c.
