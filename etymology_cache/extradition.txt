extradition (n.)

1833, from French extradition (18c.), apparently a coinage of Voltaire's, from Latin ex out (see
ex-) + traditionem (nominative traditio) a delivering up, handing over, noun of action from tradere
to hand over (see tradition).  <blockquote>  This word might be adopted in our language with
advantage, as we have none which conveys the same meaning. Extradition signifies the delivering up
of criminals who may have sought refuge in any country, to the government whose subjects they are,
on a claim being made to this effect. [from a footnote to the word extradition in translation of
Memoirs of Marshal Ney, London, 1833]  </blockquote>
