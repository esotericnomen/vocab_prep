incognito (adj./adv.)

1640s, from Italian incognito unknown, especially in connection with traveling, from Latin
incognitus unknown, from in- not, opposite of, without (see in- (1)) + cognitus, past participle of
cognoscere to get to know (see cognizance). Fem. form incognita was maintained through 19c. by those
scrupulous about Latin. Incog was a common 18c. colloquial abbreviation.


terra incognita (n.)

unknown or unexplored region, 1610s, Latin, literally unknown land, from terra (see terrain) + fem.
