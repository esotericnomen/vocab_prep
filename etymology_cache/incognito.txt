1640s, from Italian incognito unknown, especially in connection with traveling, from Latin
incognitus unknown, from in- not, opposite of, without (see <a
href=/index.php?term=in-&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>in-</a> (1)) + cognitus, past
participle of cognoscere to get to know (see <a
href=/index.php?term=cognizance&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>cognizance</a>). Fem.
form incognita was maintained through 19c. by those scrupulous about Latin. Incog was a common 18c.
colloquial abbreviation.
