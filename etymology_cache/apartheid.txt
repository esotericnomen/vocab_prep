apartheid (n.)

1947 (policy begun 1948), from Afrikaans apartheid (1929 in a South African socio-political
context), literally separateness, from Dutch apart separate (from French &agrave;part; see apart) +
suffix -heid, cognate of English -hood. The official English synonym was separate development
(1955).Segregation is such an active word that it suggests someone is trying to segregate someone
else. So the word apartheid was introduced. Now it has such a stench in the nostrils of the world,
they are referring to autogenous development. [Alan Paton, New York Times, Oct. 24, 1960]


separate (adj.)

detached, kept apart, c.1600, from separate (v.) or from Latin separatus. Separate but equal in
reference to U.S. segregation policies on railroads is attested from 1888. Separate development,
official name of apartheid in South Africa, is from 1955. Related: Separately (1550s); separateness.
Frequently the colored coach is little better than a cattle car. Generally one half the smoking car
is reserved for the colored car. Often only a cloth curtain or partition run half way up separates
this so-called colored car from the smoke, obscene language, and foul air of the smokers' half of
the car. All classes and conditions of colored humanity, from the most cultured and refined to the
most degraded and filthy, without regard to sex, good breeding or ability to pay for better
accommodation, are crowded into this separate, but equal (?) half car. [Rev. Norman B. Wood, The
White Side of a Black Subject, 1897]
