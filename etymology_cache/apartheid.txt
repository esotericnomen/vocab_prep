1947 (policy begun 1948), from Afrikaans apartheid (1929 in a South African socio-political
context), literally separateness, from Dutch apart separate (from French &agrave;part; see <a
href=/index.php?term=apart&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>apart</a>) + suffix -heid,
cognate of English <a href=/index.php?term=-hood&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>-hood</a>. The official English synonym was separate development
(1955).<blockquote>Segregation is such an active word that it suggests someone is trying to
segregate someone else. So the word apartheid was introduced. Now it has such a stench in the
nostrils of the world, they are referring to autogenous development. [Alan Paton, New York Times,
Oct. 24, 1960]</blockquote>
