apartheid (n.)

1947 (policy begun 1948), from Afrikaans apartheid (1929 in a South African socio-political
context), literally separateness, from Dutch apart separate (from French &agrave;part; see apart) +
suffix -heid, cognate of English -hood. The official English synonym was separate development
(1955).<blockquote>Segregation is such an active word that it suggests someone is trying to
segregate someone else. So the word apartheid was introduced. Now it has such a stench in the
nostrils of the world, they are referring to autogenous development. [Alan Paton, New York Times,
Oct. 24, 1960]</blockquote>
