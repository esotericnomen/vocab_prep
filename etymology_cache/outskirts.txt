outskirt (n.)

outer border, 1590s, from out + skirt (n.). Now only in plural, outskirts. Originally in Spenser.


environs (n.)

outskirts, 1660s, from French environs, plural of Old French environ compass, circuit, from environ
(adv.) around, round about (see environ).


skirt (n.)

early 14c., lower part of a woman's dress, from Old Norse skyrta shirt, a kind of kirtle; see shirt.
Sense development from shirt to skirt is possibly related to the long shirts of peasant garb
(compare Low German cognate Sch&ouml;rt, in some dialects woman's gown). Sense of border, edge (in
outskirts, etc.) first recorded late 15c. Metonymic use for women collectively is from 1550s; slang
sense of young woman is from 1906; skirt-chaser first attested 1942.


faubourg (n.)

suburb, late 15c., from Middle French faux bourg, said by French authorities to be from Old French
forsbourc (12c.) suburbs, outskirts, literally that which is outside the town, from fors outside
(from Latin foris) + bourc town, of Frankish origin (cognate with English borough), altered in
Middle French by folk-etymology to faux bourg false town (suburbs were seen as inauthentic).


circumstance (n.)

early 13c., conditions surrounding and accompanying an event, from Old French circonstance
circumstance, situation, also literally, outskirts (13c., Modern French circonstance), from Latin
circumstantia surrounding condition, neuter plural of circumstans (genitive circumstantis), present
participle of circumstare stand around, surround, encompass, occupy, take possession of from circum
around (see circum-) + stare to stand from PIE root *sta- to stand (see stet). The Latin word is a
loan-translation of Greek peristasis.    Meaning a person's surroundings, environment is from mid-
14c. Meaning a detail is from c.1300; sense of that which is non-essential is from 1590s. Obsolete
sense of formality about an important event (late 14c.) lingers in Shakespeare's phrase pomp and
circumstance (Othello III, iii).
