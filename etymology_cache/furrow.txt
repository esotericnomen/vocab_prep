Old English furh furrow, trench, from Proto-Germanic *furkh- (cognates: Old Frisian furch furrow;
Middle Dutch vore, Dutch voor; German Furche furrow; Old Norse for furrow, drainage ditch), from PIE
*perk- (cognates: Latin porca ridge between two furrows, Old Irish -rech, Welsh rhych furrow). Some
scholars connect this word with Latin porcus, Eng. FARROW, assigning to the common root the sense
'to root like a swine.'  [OED]
