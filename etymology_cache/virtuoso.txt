lulu (n.)

remarkable person or thing, 1886 (first attested in a baseball article from New Orleans, U.S.), of
uncertain origin; some suggest a connection to earlier looly beautiful girl, of unknown origin. But
the reference more likely is to Lulu Hurst (1869-1950), the Georgia Wonder, who was a popular
attraction 1883-85 demonstrating her supposed mysterious force that allowed her to effortlessly
move, with just a light touch, umbrellas and canes held tight by others. She barnstormed the U.S.
and, at 15, was, briefly, one of the most famous women in the land. The skeptics soon explained her
trick and burst the bubble, but not before her name was used as a word:    Such [musically
uneducated persons] start from the avowed or unavowed supposition that the pianist or violinist's
art necessitates no higher qualities than does plate-spinning, dancing, or the feats of a Lulu. [The
Hero as Virtuoso, in London Society magazine, 1883]
