terse (adj.)

1590s (implied in tersely), clean-cut, burnished, neat, from French ters clean, and directly from
Latin tersus wiped off, clean, neat, from past participle of tergere to rub, polish, wipe. Sense of
concise or pithy in style or language is from 1777, which led to a general sense of neatly concise.
The pejorative meaning brusque is a fairly recent development. Related: Terseness.


apothegm (n.)

pithy saying, 1550s, from Greek apophthegma terse, pointed saying, literally something clearly
spoken, from apophthengesthai to speak one's opinion plainly, from apo- from (see apo-) +
phthengesthai to utter. See aphorism for nuances of usage. Spelling apophthegm, restored by Johnson,
is preferred in England, according to OED.
