dirge (n.)

early 13c., dirige (current contracted form is from c.1400), from Latin dirige direct! imperative of
dirigere to direct, probably from antiphon Dirige, Domine, Deus meus, in conspectu tuo viam meam,
Direct, O Lord, my God, my way in thy sight, from Psalm v:9, which opened the Matins service in the
Office of the Dead. Transferred sense of any funeral song is from c.1500.
