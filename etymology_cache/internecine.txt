internecine (adj.)

1660s, deadly, destructive, from Latin internecinus very deadly, murderous, destructive, from
internecare kill or destroy, from inter (see inter-) + necare kill (see noxious). Considered in the
OED as misinterpreted in Johnson's Dictionary [1755], which defined it as endeavouring mutual
destruction, on association of inter- with mutual when the prefix supposedly is used in this case as
an intensive. From Johnson, wrongly or not, has come the main modern definition of mutually
destructive.
