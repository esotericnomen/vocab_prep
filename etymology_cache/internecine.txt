1660s, deadly, destructive, from Latin internecinus very deadly, murderous, destructive, from
internecare kill or destroy, from inter (see <a href=/index.php?term=inter-&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>inter-</a>) + necare kill (see <a
href=/index.php?term=noxious&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>noxious</a>). Considered in
the OED as misinterpreted in Johnson's Dictionary [1755], which defined it as endeavouring mutual
destruction, on association of inter- with mutual when the prefix supposedly is used in this case as
an intensive. From Johnson, wrongly or not, has come the main modern definition of mutually
destructive.
