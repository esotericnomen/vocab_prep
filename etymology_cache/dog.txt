dog (n.)

Old English docga, a late, rare word used of a powerful breed of canine. It forced out Old English
hund (the general Germanic and Indo-European word; see canine) by 16c. and subsequently was picked
up in many continental languages (French dogue (16c.), Danish dogge), but the origin remains one of
the great mysteries of English etymology.    Many expressions -- a dog's life (c.1600), go to the
dogs (1610s), etc. -- reflect earlier hard use of the animals as hunting accessories, not pampered
pets. In ancient times, the dog was the worst throw in dice (attested in Greek, Latin, and Sanskrit,
where the word for the lucky player was literally the dog-killer), which plausibly explains the
Greek word for danger, kindynas, which appears to be play the dog.    Slang meaning ugly woman is
from 1930s; that of sexually aggressive man is from 1950s. Adjectival phrase dog-eat-dog attested by
1850s. Dog tag is from 1918. To dog-ear a book is from 1650s; dog-eared in extended sense of worn,
unkempt is from 1894. <blockquote>Notwithstanding, as a dog hath a day, so may I perchance have time
to declare it in deeds. [Princess Elizabeth, 1550]  </blockquote>Phrase put on the dog get dressed
up (1934) may look back to the stiff stand-up shirt collars that in the 1890s were the height of
male fashion (and were known as dog-collars at least from 1883), with reference to collars worn by
dogs. The common Spanish word for dog, perro, also is a mystery word of unknown origin, perhaps from
Iberian. A group of Slavic dog words (Old Church Slavonic pisu, Polish pies, Serbo-Croatian pas)
likewise are of unknown origin.
