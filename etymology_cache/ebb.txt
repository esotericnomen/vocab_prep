Old English ebba ebb, low tide, perhaps from Proto-Germanic *abjon (cognates: Old Frisian ebba, Old
Saxon ebbiunga, Middle Dutch ebbe, Dutch eb, German Ebbe), from *ab-, from PIE root *apo- off, away
(see <a href=/index.php?term=apo&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>apo</a>-). Figurative
sense of decline, decay is c.1400.
