fugitive

late 14c. (adjective and noun), from Old French fugitif, from Latin fugitivus fleeing (but commonly
used as a noun meaning runaway, fugitive slave, deserter), from past participle stem of fugere run
away, flee, from PIE root *bheug- (1) to flee (cognates: Greek pheugein to flee, Lithuanian bugstu
be frightened). Replaced Old English flyma.
