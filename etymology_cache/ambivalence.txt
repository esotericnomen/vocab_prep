simultaneous conflicting feelings, 1924 (1912 as ambivalency), from German Ambivalenz, coined 1910
by Swiss psychologist Eugen Bleuler (1857-1939) on model of German Equivalenz equivalence, etc.,
from Latin ambi- both (see <a href=/index.php?term=ambi-&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>ambi-</a>) + valentia strength, from present participle of valere be strong
(see <a href=/index.php?term=valiant&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>valiant</a>). A
psychological term that by 1929 had taken on a broader literary and general sense.
