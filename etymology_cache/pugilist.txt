pugilist (n.)

1789, from Latin pugil boxer, fist-fighter, related to pugnus a fist (see pugnacious) + -ist.
Related: Pugilistic (1789); pugilistically. Pugil occasionally turns up in English as boxer, fist-
fighter (from 1640s), but it has not caught on. Pugil stick (1962) was introduced by U.S. military
as a substitute for rifles in bayonet drills.


bruiser (n.)

to put up a fight.

ham (n.2)

overacting inferior performer, 1882, American English, apparently a shortening of hamfatter (1880)
actor of low grade, said since at least 1889 to be from an old minstrel show song, The Ham-fat Man
(1863). The song, a black-face number, has nothing to do with acting, so the connection must be with
the quality of acting in minstrel shows, where the song was popular. Ham also had a sports slang
sense of incompetent pugilist circa 1888, perhaps from ham-fisted. The notion of amateurish led to
the sense of amateur radio operator (1919). The verb in the performance sense is first recorded
1933. As an adjective in this sense by 1935.
