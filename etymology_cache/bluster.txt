bluster (n.)

1580s, from bluster (v.).


bluster (v.)

late 14c., from a Low German source, such as Middle Low German bl&uuml;stren to blow violently, East
Frisian bl&uuml;stern to bluster (see blow (v.1)). Related: Blustered; blustering.


blustery (adj.)

1707, from bluster (n.) + -y (2). Blustering in this sense is recorded from 1510s.


declaim (v.)

late 14c., from Middle French d&eacute;clamer and directly from Latin declamare to practice public
speaking, to bluster, from de- intensive prefix + clamare to cry, shout (see claim (v.)). At first
in English spelled declame, but altered under influence of claim. Related: Declaimed; declaiming.


huff (v.)

mid-15c., apparently imitative of exhaling. Extended sense of bluster with indignation is attested
from 1590s. Related: Huffed; huffing. As a slang term for a type of narcotics abuse, by 1996. As a
noun from 1590s; to leave in a huff is recorded from 1778. Popular terms for strong beer or ale
noted from 1577 include huff cap as well as mad dog and dragon's milk.


roister (v.)

bluster, swagger, be bold, noisy, vaunting, or turbulent, 1580s, from an obsolete noun roister noisy
bully (1550s, displaced by 19c. by roisterer), from Middle French ruistre ruffian, from Old French
ruiste boorish, gross, uncouth, from Latin rusticus (see rustic (adj.)). Related: Roistered;
roistering. Ralph Royster-Doyster is the title and lead character of what is sometimes called the
first English comedy (Udall, 1555).


hurl (v.)

early 13c., hurlen, to run against (each other), come into collision, later throw forcibly (c.1300);
rush violently (late 14c.); perhaps related to Low German hurreln to throw, to dash, and East
Frisian hurreln to roar, to bluster. OED suggests all are from an imitative Germanic base *hurr
expressing rapid motion; see also hurry. The noun is attested from late 14c., originally rushing
water. For difference between hurl and hurtle (which apparently were confused since early Middle
English) see hurtle.
