pander (v.)

to indulge (another), to minister to base passions, c.1600, from pander (n.). Related: Pandered;
pandering.


pander (n.)

arranger of sexual liaisons, one who supplies another with the means of gratifying lust, 1520s,
procurer, pimp, from Middle English Pandare (late 14c.), used by Chaucer (Troylus and Cryseyde), who
borrowed it from Boccaccio (who had it in Italian form Pandaro in Filostrato) as name of the prince
(Greek Pandaros), who procured the love of Cressida (his niece in Chaucer, his cousin in Boccaccio)
for Troilus. The story and the name are medieval inventions. Spelling influenced by agent suffix
-er.


ruffian (n.)

1530s, a boisterous, brutal fellow, one ready to commit any crime, from Middle French rufian a pimp
(15c.), from Italian ruffiano a pander, pimp, of uncertain origin, perhaps from a Germanic source
related to rough (adj.), but Dutch roffiaan, German Ruffian are said to be from French. English
meaning might have been influenced by similarity of sound to rough. Related: Ruffianly.    The
Romanic words (such as Medieval Latin ruffianus, Proven&ccedil;al rufian, Catalan rufia, Spanish
rufian) preserve the sense of protector or owner of whores. For sense evolution in English, compare
bully (n.).
