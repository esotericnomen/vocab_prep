1794 worst condition possible, borrowed (by Coleridge) from French pessimisme, formed (on model of
French optimisme) from Latin pessimus worst, originally bottom-most, from PIE *ped-samo-,
superlative of root *pes- foot (see <a href=/index.php?term=foot&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>foot</a> (n.)). As a name given to the doctrines of Schopenhauer, Hartmann,
etc., that this is the worst possible world, or that everything tends toward evil, it is first
recorded 1835, from German pessimismus (Schopenhauer, 1819). The attempt to make a verb of it as
pessimize (1862) did not succeed.
