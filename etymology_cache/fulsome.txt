fulsome (adj.)

Middle English compound of ful full (see full (adj.)) + -som (see -some (1)). Sense evolved from
abundant, full (mid-13c.) to plump, well-fed (mid-14c.) to overgrown, overfed (1640s) and thus, of
language, offensive to taste or good manners (1660s). Since the 1960s, however, it commonly has been
used in its original, favorable sense, especially in fulsome praise. Related: Fulsomely;
fulsomeness.
