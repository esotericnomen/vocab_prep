Middle English compound of ful full (see <a href=/index.php?term=full&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>full</a> (adj.)) + -som (see <a
href=/index.php?term=-some&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>-some</a> (1)). Sense evolved
from abundant, full (mid-13c.) to plump, well-fed (mid-14c.) to overgrown, overfed (1640s) and thus,
of language, offensive to taste or good manners (1660s). Since the 1960s, however, it commonly has
been used in its original, favorable sense, especially in fulsome praise. Related: Fulsomely;
fulsomeness.
