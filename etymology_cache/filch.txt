filch (v.)

steal, 1560s, slang, perhaps from c.1300 filchen to snatch, take as booty, of unknown origin.
Liberman says filch is probably from German filzen comb through. Related: Filched; filching.


filcher (n.)

1570s, agent noun from filch.


busk (v.)

to prepare, to dress oneself, also to go, set out, c.1300, probably from Old Norse buask to prepare
oneself, reflexive of bua to prepare (see bound (adj.2)) + contraction of Old Norse reflexive
pronoun sik. Most common in northern Middle English and surviving chiefly in Scottish and northern
English dialect. Related boun had the same senses in northern and Scottish Middle English. Related:
Busked; busking.    The nautical term is attested from 1660s (in a general sense of to tack, to beat
to windward), apparently from obsolete French busquer to shift, filch, prowl, which is related to
Italian buscare to filch, prowl, Spanish buscar (from Old Spanish boscar), perhaps originally from
bosco wood (see bush (n.)), with a hunting notion of beating a wood to flush game.


rifle (v.1)

to plunder, early 14c. (implied in rifling), from Old French rifler strip, filch, plunder, peel off
(skin or bark), fleece, literally to graze, scratch (12c.), probably from a Germanic source (compare
Old English geriflian to wrinkle, Old High German riffilon to tear by rubbing, Old Norse rifa to
tear, break). Related: Rifled; rifling.
