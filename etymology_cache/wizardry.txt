wizardry (n.)

1580s, from wizard + -ry.


reck (v.)

Old English reccan (2) take care of, be interested in, care for; have regard to, take heed of; to
care, heed; desire (to do something) (strong verb, past tense rohte, past participle rought), from
West Germanic *rokjan, from Proto-Germanic *rokja- (cognates: Old Saxon rokjan, Middle Dutch roeken,
Old Norse r&aelig;kja to care for, Old High German giruochan to care for, have regard to, German
geruhen to deign, which is influenced by ruhen to rest).    And in that very moment, away behind in
some courtyard of the City, a cock crowed. Shrill and clear he crowed, recking nothing of wizardry
or war, welcoming only the morning that in the sky far above the shadows of death was coming with
the dawn. [J.R.R. Tolkien, Return of the King, 1955]    The -k- sound is probably a northern
influence from Norse. No known cognates outside Germanic. From its earliest appearance in Eng., reck
is almost exclusively employed in negative or interrogative clauses [OED]. Related: Recked; recking.
