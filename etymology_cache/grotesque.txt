c.1600s, originally a noun (1560s), from Middle French crotesque (16c., Modern French grotesque),
from Italian grottesco, literally of a cave, from grotta (see <a
href=/index.php?term=grotto&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>grotto</a>). The usual
explanation is that the word first was used of paintings found on the walls of basements of Roman
ruins (Italian pittura grottesca), which OED finds intrinsically plausible. Originally fanciful,
fantastic, sense became pejorative after mid-18c. Related: Grotesquely; grotesqueness.
