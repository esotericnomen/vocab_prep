gelatinous (adj.)

1724, from gelatin + -ous; probably modeled on French g&eacute;latineux. Related: Gelatinously;
gelatinousness.


protoplasm (n.)

1848, from German Protoplasma (1846), used by German botanist Hugo von Mohl (1805-1872), on notion
of first-formed, from Greek proto- first (see proto-) + plasma something molded (see -plasm).    The
word was in Late Latin with a sense of first created thing, and it might have existed in
ecclesiastical Greek in a different sense. It was used 1839 by Czech physiologist Johannes
Evangelista Purkinje (1787-1869) to denote the gelatinous fluid found in living tissue. The modern
meaning is a refinement of this. This word prevailed, though German language purists preferred
Urschleim.
