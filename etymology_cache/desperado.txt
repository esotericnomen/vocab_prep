desperado (n.)

c.1600, a person in despair, mock-Spanish version of desperate (n.) reckless criminal (1560s),  from
Latin desperatus (see desperation). There was an adjective desperado in Old Spanish, meaning out of
hope, desperate, but apparently it never was used as a noun and it probably has nothing to do with
the English word. Meaning a desperate or reckless man is recorded from 1640s.
