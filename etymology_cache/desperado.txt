c.1600, a person in despair, mock-Spanish version of desperate (n.) reckless criminal (1560s),  from
Latin desperatus (see <a href=/index.php?term=desperation&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>desperation</a>). There was an adjective desperado in Old Spanish, meaning out
of hope, desperate, but apparently it never was used as a noun and it probably has nothing to do
with the English word. Meaning a desperate or reckless man is recorded from 1640s.
