will (v.1)

Old English *willan, wyllan to wish, desire; be willing; be used to; be about to (past tense wolde),
from Proto-Germanic *willjan (cognates: Old Saxon willian, Old Norse vilja, Old Frisian willa, Dutch
willen, Old High German wellan, German wollen, Gothic wiljan to will, wish, desire, Gothic waljan to
choose).    The Germanic words are from PIE root *wel- (2) to wish, will (cognates: Sanskrit vrnoti
chooses, prefers, varyah to be chosen, eligible, excellent, varanam choosing; Avestan verenav- to
wish, will, choose; Greek elpis hope; Latin volo, velle to wish, will, desire; Old Church Slavonic
voljo, voliti to will, veljo, veleti to command; Lithuanian velyti to wish, favor, pa-velmi I will,
viliuos I hope; Welsh gwell better).    Compare also Old English wel well, literally according to
one's wish; wela well-being, riches. The use as a future auxiliary was already developing in Old
English. The implication of intention or volition distinguishes it from shall, which expresses or
implies obligation or necessity. Contracted forms, especially after pronouns, began to appear 16c.,
as in sheele for she will. The form with an apostrophe is from 17c.
