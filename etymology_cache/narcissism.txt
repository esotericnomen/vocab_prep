narcissism (n.)

1905, from German Narzissismus, coined 1899 (in Die sexuellen Perversit&auml;ten), by German
psychiatrist Paul N&auml;cke (1851-1913), on a comparison suggested 1898 by Havelock Ellis, from
Greek Narkissos, name of a beautiful youth in mythology (Ovid, Metamorphoses, iii.370) who fell in
love with his own reflection in a spring and was turned to the flower narcissus (q.v.). Coleridge
used the word in a letter from 1822.  <blockquote>  But already Krishna, enamoured of himself, had
resolved to experience lust for his own self; he manifested his own Nature in the cow-herd girls and
enjoyed them. [Karapatri, Lingopasana-rahasya, Siddhanta, II, 1941-2]  </blockquote>  Sometimes
erroneously as narcism.
