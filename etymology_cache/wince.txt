wince (v.)

c.1300, wincen; mid-13c. winchen, to recoil suddenly, from Anglo-French *wenchir, Old North French
*wenchier (Old French guenchir) to turn aside, avoid, from Frankish *wenkjan, from Proto-Germanic
*wankjan (cognates: Old High German wankon to stagger, totter, Old Norse vakka to stray, hover; see
wink (v.)). Originally of horses. Modern form is attested from late 13c. Related: Winced; wincing.


winch (n.)

late 13c., from Old English wince winch, pulley, from Proto-Germanic *winkja-, from PIE *weng- to
bend, curve (see wink (v.)). Perhaps so called in reference to the bent handle.


blench (v.)

Old English blencan deceive, cheat, from Proto-Germanic *blenk- to shine, dazzle, blind, from PIE
root *bhel- (1) to shine, flash, burn (see bleach (v.)). Sense of move suddenly, wince, dodge is
from c.1300. Related: Blenched; blenching.


lapwing (n.)

Middle English lappewinke (late 14c.), lapwyngis (early 15c.), folk etymology alteration of Old
English hleapewince, probably literally leaper-winker, from hleapan to leap + wince totter, waver,
move rapidly, related to wincian to wink. Said to be so called from the manner of its flight [OED]
in reference to its irregular flapping manner of flight [Barnhart], but the lapwing also flaps on
the ground pretending to have a broken wing to lure egg-hunters away from its nest, which seems a
more logical explanation. Its Greek name was polyplagktos luring on deceitfully.
