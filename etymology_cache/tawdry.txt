tawdry (adj.)

no longer fresh or elegant but worn as if it were so; in cheap and ostentatious imitation of what is
rich or costly, 1670s, adjective use of noun tawdry silk necktie for women (1610s), shortened from
tawdry lace (1540s), an alteration (with adhesion of the -t- from Saint) of St. Audrey's lace, a
necktie or ribbon sold at the annual fair at Ely on Oct. 17 commemorating St. Audrey (queen of
Northumbria, died 679). Her association with lace necklaces is that she supposedly died of a throat
tumor, which, according to Bede, she considered God's punishment for her youthful stylishness.
Related: Tawdriness.  <blockquote>  I know of a surety that I deservedly bear the weight of my
trouble on my neck, for I remember that, when I was a young maiden, I bore on it the needless weight
of necklaces; and therefore I believe the Divine goodness would have me endure the pain in my neck,
that so I may be absolved from the guilt of my needless levity, having now, instead of gold and
pearls, the fiery heat of a tumour rising on my neck. [A.M. Sellar translation, 1907]  </blockquote>
