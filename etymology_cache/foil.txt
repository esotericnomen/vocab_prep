thin sheet of metal, early 14c., from Old French fueille leaf, from Latin folia leaves, plural
(mistaken for fem. singular) of folium leaf (see <a
href=/index.php?term=folio&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>folio</a>).  <br /><br />
The sense of one who enhances another by contrast (1580s) is from the practice of backing a gem with
metal foil to make it shine more brilliantly. The meaning light sword used in fencing (1590s) could
be from this sense, or from foil (v.). The modern sense of metallic food wrap is from 1946.
