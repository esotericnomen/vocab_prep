foil (n.)

thin sheet of metal, early 14c., from Old French fueille leaf, from Latin folia leaves, plural
(mistaken for fem. singular) of folium leaf (see folio).    The sense of one who enhances another by
contrast (1580s) is from the practice of backing a gem with metal foil to make it shine more
brilliantly. The meaning light sword used in fencing (1590s) could be from this sense, or from foil
(v.). The modern sense of metallic food wrap is from 1946.
