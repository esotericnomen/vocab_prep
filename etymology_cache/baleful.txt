baleful (adj.)

Old English bealu-full dire, wicked, cruel, from bealu harm, injury, ruin, evil, mischief,
wickedness, a noxious thing, from Proto-Germanic *balwom (cognates: Old Saxon balu, Old Frisian balu
evil, Old High German balo destruction, Old Norse bol, Gothic balwjan to torment), from PIE root
*bhelu- to harm. During Anglo-Saxon times, the noun was in poetic use only (in compounds such as
bealubenn mortal wound, bealu&eth;onc evil thought), and for long baleful has belonged exclusively
to poets. Related: Balefully.


blight (n.)

1610s, origin obscure; according to OED it emerged into literary speech from the talk of gardeners
and farmers, perhaps ultimately from Old English bl&aelig;ce, bl&aelig;c&eth;u, a scrofulous skin
condition and/or from Old Norse blikna become pale. Used in a general way of agricultural diseases,
sometimes with suggestion of invisible baleful influence; hence figurative sense of anything which
withers hopes or prospects or checks prosperity (1828). Compare slang blighter. Urban blight
attested by 1935.
