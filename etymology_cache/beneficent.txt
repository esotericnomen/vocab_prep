beneficent (adj.)

1610s, doing good, charitable, probably from beneficent on model of magnificent, etc.


beneficence (n.)

quality of being beneficent, kind, charitable, mid-15c., from Latin beneficentia kindness,
generosity, a back-formation from beneficentior (see beneficent).


faith-healer (n.)

Also faith healer, attested by 1874; from faith + healer.    The power which a man's imagination has
over his body to heal it or make it sick is a force which none of us is born without. The first man
had it, the last one will possess it. If left to himself, a man is most likely to use only the
mischievous half of the force--the half which invents imaginary ailments for him and cultivates
them; and if he is one of those very wise people, he is quite likely to scoff at the beneficent half
of the force and deny its existence. [Mark Twain, Christian Science, 1907]


providence (n.)

late 14c., foresight, prudent anticipation, from Old French providence divine providence, foresight
(12c.) and directly from Latin providentia foresight, precaution, foreknowledge, from providentem
(nominative providens), present participle of providere (see provide).   Providence (usually
capitalized) God as beneficent caretaker, first recorded c.1600, from earlier use of the word for
God's beneficient care or guidance (14c.), short for divine providence, etc. The noun in Latin
occasionally had a similar sense.
