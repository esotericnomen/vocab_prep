late 14c. (early 14c. as a surname), from Old French meur mature, fully grown, ripe, hence discreet,
from Latin maturus mature (see <a href=/index.php?term=mature&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>mature</a> (v.)) [OED]. The de- in this word is of uncertain meaning. Or
possibly from Anglo-French demur&eacute; (Old French demor&eacute;), past participle of demorer
stay, and influenced by meur [Barnhart]. Or from Old French de (bon) murs of good manners, from murs
(Modern French moeurs) [Klein].
