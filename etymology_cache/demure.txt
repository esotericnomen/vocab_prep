demure (adj.)

late 14c. (early 14c. as a surname), from Old French meur mature, fully grown, ripe, hence discreet,
from Latin maturus mature (see mature (v.)) [OED]. The de- in this word is of uncertain meaning. Or
possibly from Anglo-French demur&eacute; (Old French demor&eacute;), past participle of demorer
stay, and influenced by meur [Barnhart]. Or from Old French de (bon) murs of good manners, from murs
(Modern French moeurs) [Klein].


coy (adj.)

early 14c., quiet, modest, demure, from Old French coi, earlier quei quiet, still, placid, gentle,
ultimately from Latin quietus resting, at rest (see quiet (n.)). Meaning shy emerged late 14c.
Meaning unwilling to commit is 1961. Related: Coyly; coyness.


prude (n.)

1704, woman who affects or upholds modesty in a degree considered excessive, from French prude
excessively prim or demure woman, first recorded in Moli&egrave;re. Perhaps a false back-formation
or an ellipsis of preudefemme a discreet, modest woman, from Old French prodefame noblewoman,
gentlewoman; wife, consort, fem. equivalent of prudhomme a brave man (see proud); or perhaps a
direct noun use of the French adjective prude prudish, from Old French prude, prode, preude good,
virtuous, modest, a feminine form of the adjective preux. Also occasionally as an adjective in
English 18c.
