whittle (v.)

1550s, to cut thin shavings from (something) with a knife, from Middle English whittel a knife,
especially a large one (c.1400), variant of thwittle (late 14c.), from Old English &thorn;witan to
cut, from Proto-Germanic *thwit- (cognates: Old Norse &thorn;veita to hew), from PIE root *twei- to
agitate, shake, toss. Figurative sense is attested from 1746. Related: Whittled; whittling.


fritter (v.)

whittle away, 1728, from fritters fragment or shred, possibly from a noun sense, but this is not
recorded as early as the verb; perhaps an alteration of 16c. fitters fragments or pieces, perhaps
ultimately from Old French fraiture a breaking, from Latin fractura. Or perhaps from a Germanic
source (compare Middle High German vetze clothes, rags).


thwaite (n.)

cleared land, 1620s, from Old Norse or Old Danish &thorn;veit a clearing, meadow, paddock, literally
a cutting, cut-piece (related to Old English &thorn;witan to cut, cut off; see whittle). Always a
rare word and now obsolete, but frequently encountered in place names, but It is unclear whether the
base meaning was 'something cut off, detached piece of land,' or 'something cut down, felled tree'
... [Cambridge Dictionary of English Place-Names].
