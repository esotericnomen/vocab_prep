1590s, thin, unsubstantial, irregularly formed from Latin tenuis thin, drawn out, meager, slim,
slender, figuratively trifling, insignificant, poor, low in rank, from PIE root *ten- to stretch
(cognates: Sanskrit tanuh thin, literally stretched out; see <a
href=/index.php?term=tenet&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>tenet</a>) + <a
href=/index.php?term=-ous&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>-ous</a>. The correct form
with respect to the Latin is <a href=/index.php?term=tenuious&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>tenuious</a>. The figurative sense of having slight importance, not substantial
is found from 1817 in English. Related: Tenuously; tenuousness.
