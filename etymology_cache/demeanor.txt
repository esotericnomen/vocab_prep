demeanor (n.)

late 15c., from obsolete Middle English demean handle, manage, conduct, later behave in a certain
way (early 14c.), from Old French demener (11c.) to guide, conduct; to live, dwell, from de-
completely (see de-) + mener to lead, direct, from Latin minare to threaten, in Late Latin to drive
(a herd of animals); see menace. Sense in English evolved from notion of conduct, manage (oneself).
Spelling changed by influence of nouns in -or, -our.
