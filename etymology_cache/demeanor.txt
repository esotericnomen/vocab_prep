late 15c., from obsolete Middle English demean handle, manage, conduct, later behave in a certain
way (early 14c.), from Old French demener (11c.) to guide, conduct; to live, dwell, from de-
completely (see <a href=/index.php?term=de-&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>de-</a>) +
mener to lead, direct, from Latin minare to threaten, in Late Latin to drive (a herd of animals);
see <a href=/index.php?term=menace&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>menace</a>. Sense in
English evolved from notion of conduct, manage (oneself). Spelling changed by influence of nouns in
-or, -our.
