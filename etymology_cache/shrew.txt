small insectivorous mammal, Old English screawa shrew-mouse, unknown outside English, and the
absence of evidence for the word between the OE. period and the 16th c is remarkable [OED]. Perhaps
from Proto-Germanic *skraw-, from PIE *skreu- to cut; cutting tool (see <a
href=/index.php?term=shred&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>shred</a> (n.)), in reference
to the shrew's pointed snout. Alternative Old English word for it was scirfemus, from sceorfan to
gnaw.  <br /><br />  The meaning peevish, malignant, clamorous, spiteful, vexatious, turbulent woman
[Johnson] is late 14c., from earlier sense of spiteful person (male or female), mid-13c.,
traditionally said to derive from some supposed malignant influence of the animal, which was once
believed to have a venomous bite and was held in superstitious dread (compare <a
href=/index.php?term=beshrew&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>beshrew</a>). Paired with
sheep from 1560s as the contrasting types of wives.
