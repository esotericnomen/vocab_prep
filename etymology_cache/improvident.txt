improvident (adj.)

1510s, from im- not + provident. It retains a stronger connection with the provide aspect of Latin
providere. Related: Improvidently.


slather (v.)

spread liberally, 1847, of uncertain origin. Early 19c. local glossaries from western England have
the word with a sense to slip or slide.   Slather on the manure on all the hoed crops, if you have
it; if not buy of your improvident neighbor. [Genesee Farmer, June 1847]    Sometimes said to be
from a dialectal noun meaning large amount (usually as plural, slathers), but this is first attested
1855. Related: Slathered; slathering.
