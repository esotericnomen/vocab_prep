sibling (n.)

brother or sister, 1903, modern revival (in anthropology) of Old English sibling relative, kinsman,
from sibb kinship, relationship; love, friendship, peace, happiness, from Proto-Germanic *sibja-
blood relation, relative, properly one's own (cognates: Old Saxon sibba, Old Frisian, Middle Dutch
sibbe, Old High German sippa, German Sippe, Gothic sibja kin, kindred), from PIE s(w)e-bh(o)-
(cognates: Old Church Slavonic sobistvo, Russian sob character, individuality), an enlargement of
the root *swe- self (see idiom). Related to the second element in gossip.  <blockquote>The word
'sib' or 'sibling' is coming into use in genetics in the English-speaking world, as an equivalent of
the convenient German term 'Geschwister' [E.&amp;C.; Paul, Human Heredity, 1930]  </blockquote>  In
Old English, sibb and its compounds covered grounds of brotherly love, familial affection which
tended later to lump into love (n.), as in sibsumnes peace, concord, brotherly love, sibbian (v.)
bring together, reconcile, sibbecoss kiss of peace. Sibship, however, is a modern formation (1908).
Sib persisted through Middle English as a noun, adjective, and verb expressing kinship and
relationship.
