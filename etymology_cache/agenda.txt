agenda (n.)

1650s, from Latin agenda, literally things to be done, neuter plural of agendus, gerundive of agere
to do (see act (n.)). Originally theological (opposed to matters of belief), sense of items of
business to be done at a meeting first attested 1882. If a singular is required (=one item of the
agenda) it is now agendum, the former singular agend being obsolete [Fowler].


memorandum (n.)

early 15c., from Latin memorandum (thing) to be remembered, neuter singular of memorandus worthy of
remembrance, noteworthy, gerundive of memorare to call to mind, from memor mindful of (see memory).
Originally a word written at the top of a note, by 1540s it came to stand for the note itself. The
Latin plural is memoranda. Compare also agenda.


hacienda (n.)

1760, from Spanish hacienda landed estate, plantation, earlier facienda, from Latin facienda things
to be done, from facere to do (see factitious). For noun use of a Latin gerundive, see agenda. The
owner of one is a hacendado.    The change of Latin f- to Spanish h- is characteristic; compare
hablar from fabulari, hacer from facere, hecho from factum, hermoso from formosum. Confusion of
initial h- and f- was common in 16c. Spanish; the conquistador is known in contemporary records as
both Hernando and Fernando Cort&eacute;s.
