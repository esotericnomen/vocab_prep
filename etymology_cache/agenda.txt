1650s, from Latin agenda, literally things to be done, neuter plural of agendus, gerundive of agere
to do (see <a href=/index.php?term=act&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>act</a> (n.)).
Originally theological (opposed to matters of belief), sense of items of business to be done at a
meeting first attested 1882. If a singular is required (=one item of the agenda) it is now agendum,
the former singular agend being obsolete [Fowler].
