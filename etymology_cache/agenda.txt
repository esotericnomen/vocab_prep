agenda (n.)

1650s, from Latin agenda, literally things to be done, neuter plural of agendus, gerundive of agere
to do (see act (n.)). Originally theological (opposed to matters of belief), sense of items of
business to be done at a meeting first attested 1882. If a singular is required (=one item of the
agenda) it is now agendum, the former singular agend being obsolete [Fowler].
