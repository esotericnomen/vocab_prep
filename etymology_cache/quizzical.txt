quizzical (adj.)

1789, from quiz odd or eccentric person (1782), of unknown origin (see quiz (n.)) + -ical. Related:

quiz (v.)

1847, to question, quies, perhaps from Latin qui es? who are you?, first question in oral exams in
Latin in old-time grammar schools. Spelling quiz first recorded 1886, though it was in use as a noun
spelling from 1854, perhaps in this case from apparently unrelated slang word quiz odd person (1782,
source of quizzical). Compare quisby queer, not quite right; bankrupt (slang from 1807). From the
era of radio quiz shows comes quizzee (n.), 1940.
