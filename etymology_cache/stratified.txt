stratify (v.)

1660s, from French stratifier, from Modern Latin  stratificare, from stratum (see stratum). Related:

shale (n.)

1747, possibly a specialized use of Middle English schale shell, husk, pod (late 14c.), also fish
scale, from Old English scealu (see shell (n.)) in its base sense of thing that divides or separate,
in reference to the way the rock breaks apart in layers. Compare Middle English sheel to shell, to
take off the outer husk (late 15c.). Geological use also possibly influenced by German Schalstein
laminated limestone, and Schalgebirge layer of stone in stratified rock.
