1794, from French incandescent or directly from Latin incandescentem (nominative incandescens),
present participle of incandescere become warm, glow, kindle, from in- within (see in- (2)) +
candescere begin to glow, become white, inceptive of candere to glow, to shine (see candle).


incandescence (n.)

1650s, figurative, state of being 'inflamed,' from incandescent + -ence. Literal use from 1794.


sparkler (n.)

1713, what sparkles (often of gems, wits, or women), agent noun from sparkle (v.). In the modern
hand-held fireworks sense, from 1905.    The New York Board of Fire Underwriters has issued a
warning against the storage, sale and use of a new form of fireworks now on the market. These are
known as electric sparklers, are made in Germany, and come to this country in metal lined cases each
containing 120 dozen of pasteboard boxes with 12 sparklers in each box. The Board's warning says
that while the sparklers appear harmless, the solid incandescent mass is intensely hot and readily
communicates fire to any inflammable substance it may touch. [The Standard (weekly insurance
newspaper), Boston, May 4, 1907]
