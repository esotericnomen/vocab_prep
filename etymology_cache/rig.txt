rig (v.)

late 15c., originally nautical, to fit with sails, probably from a Scandinavian source (compare
Danish, Norwegian rigge to equip, Swedish rigga to rig, harness), though these may be from English;
perhaps ultimately from PIE *reig- to bind. Slang meaning to pre-arrange or tamper with results is
attested from 1938, perhaps a different word, from rig (n.) a trick, swindle, scheme (1775), earlier
sport, banter, ridicule (1725), of unknown origin. Also there is rig (v.) ransack from 1560s,
likewise of unknown origin. Related: Rigged; rigging.
