1590s, from Latin multifarius manifold, from multifariam (adv.) on many sides; in many places or
parts, perhaps originally that which can be expressed in many ways, from multi- many (see <a
href=/index.php?term=multi-&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>multi-</a>) + -fariam,
adverbial suffix (compare bifariam in two places), from PIE *dwi-dhe- making two. Related:
Multifariously; multifariousness. Earlier forms of the word in English were multiphary (adv.);
multipharie (adj.), both mid-15c.
