multifarious (adj.)

1590s, from Latin multifarius manifold, from multifariam (adv.) on many sides; in many places or
parts, perhaps originally that which can be expressed in many ways, from multi- many (see multi-) +
-fariam, adverbial suffix (compare bifariam in two places), from PIE *dwi-dhe- making two. Related:
Multifariously; multifariousness. Earlier forms of the word in English were multiphary (adv.);
multipharie (adj.), both mid-15c.
