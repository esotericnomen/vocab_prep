officious (adj.)

1560s, zealous, eager to serve, from Latin officiosus full of courtesy, dutiful, obliging, from
officium duty, service (see office). Sense of meddlesome, doing more than is asked or required had

(from Latin mendocium officiosum or French mensonge officieux). Related: Officiousness.
