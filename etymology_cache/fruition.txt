fruition (n.)

early 15c., act of enjoying, from Middle French fruition and directly from Late Latin fruitionem
(nominative fruitio) enjoyment, noun of action from Latin frui to use, enjoy. Sense of act or state
of bearing fruit is first recorded 1885 by mistaken association with fruit; figurative sense is from
1889.


rejoice (v.)

c.1300, to own, possess, enjoy the possession of, have the fruition of, from Old French rejoiss-,
present participle stem of rejoir, resjoir gladden, rejoice, from re-, which here is of obscure
signification, perhaps an intensive (see re-), + joir be glad, from Latin gaudere rejoice (see joy).
Originally sense in to rejoice in. Meaning to be full of joy is recorded from late 14c. Middle
English also used simple verb joy to feel gladness; to rejoice (mid-13c.) and rejoy (early 14c.).
