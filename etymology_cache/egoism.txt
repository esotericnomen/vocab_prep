from Latin ego (see ego). Meaning self-interest is from 1800.


ego (n.)

1714, as a term in metaphysics, from Latin ego I (cognate with Old English ic, see I).
Psychoanalytic sense is from 1894; sense of conceit is 1891. Ego trip first recorded 1969.    In the
book of Egoism it is written, Possession without obligation to the object possessed approaches
felicity. [George Meredith, The Egoist, 1879]


altruism (n .)

1853, unselfishness, opposite of egoism, from French altruisme, coined or popularized 1830 by French
philosopher Auguste Comte (1798-1857), from autrui, from Old French altrui, of or to others, from
Latin alteri, dative of alter other (see alter). Apparently suggested to Comte by French legal
phrase l'autrui, or in full, le bien, le droit d'autrui. The -l- is perhaps a reinsertion from the
Latin word.    There is a fable that when the badger had been stung all over by bees, a bear
consoled him by a rhapsodic account of how he himself had just breakfasted on their honey. The
badger replied peevishly, The stings are in my flesh, and the sweetness is on your muzzle. The bear,
it is said, was surprised at the badger's want of altruism. [George Eliot, Theophrastus Such, 1879]
