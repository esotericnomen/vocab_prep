c.1300, from Anglo-French enditer accuse, indict (late 13c.), Old French enditer to dictate or
inform, from Late Latin *indictare to declare, proclaim in writing, from Latin in- in (see <a

compose in words (see <a href=/index.php?term=dictate&amp;allowed_in_frame=0

Latinized c.1600. In classical Latin, indictus meant not said, unsaid. Related: Indictable;
