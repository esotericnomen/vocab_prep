to (see ad-) + littera (also litera) letter, script (see letter). Formed on model of obliteration,

bippy (n.)

hick (n.)

late 14c. as a pet form of masc. proper name Richard. Meaning awkward provincial person was
established by 1700 (see rube); earlier it was the characteristic name of a hosteler, hackneyman,
etc. (late 14c.), perhaps via alliteration. The adjective is recorded by 1914.A hick town is one
where there is no place to go where you shouldn't be. [attributed to U.S. humorist Robert Quillen

robin (n.)

common European songbird, 1540s, shortening of Robin Redbreast (mid-15c.), from masc. personal name
Robin, also (in reference to the bird) in the diminutive form robinet. Redbreast alone for the bird
is from early 15c., and the Robin might have been added for the alliteration. It ousted the native
ruddock. In North America, the name was applied to the red-breasted thrush by 1703. Robin's egg as a
shade of blue is attested from 1881.
