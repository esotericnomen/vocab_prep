superannuated (adj.)

1630s, obsolete, out of date; 1740, retired on account of old age, from Modern Latin superannuatus,
alteration (perhaps by influence of annual) of Medieval Latin superannatus (which meant more than a
year old and was used of cattle), from Latin super beyond, over (see super-) + annus year (see
annual (adj.)). Earlier in same sense was superannate (c.1600), from Medieval Latin superannatus.
Compare French suranner.
