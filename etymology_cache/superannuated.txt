1630s, obsolete, out of date; 1740, retired on account of old age, from Modern Latin superannuatus,
alteration (perhaps by influence of annual) of Medieval Latin superannatus (which meant more than a
year old and was used of cattle), from Latin super beyond, over (see <a
href=/index.php?term=super-&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>super-</a>) + annus year
(see <a href=/index.php?term=annual&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>annual</a> (adj.)).
Earlier in same sense was superannate (c.1600), from Medieval Latin superannatus. Compare French
suranner.
