caucus (v.)

1850, from caucus (n.), but caucusing is attested from 1788.


caucus (n.)

private meeting of party leaders, 1763, American English (New England), perhaps from an Algonquian
word caucauasu counselor, elder, adviser in the dialect of Virginia, or from the Caucus Club of
Boston, a 1760s social &amp; political club whose name possibly derived from Modern Greek kaukos
drinking cup. Another old guess is caulker's (meeting) [Pickering, 1816], but OED finds this
dismissable.    caucus: This noun is used throughout the United States, as a cant term for those
meetings, which are held by the different political parties, for the purpose of agreeing upon
candidates for office, or concerting any measure, which they intend to carry at the subsequent
public, or town meetings. [John Pickering, A Vocabulary, or Collection of Words and Phrases Which
Have Been Supposed to be Peculiar to the United States of America, Boston, 1816]   <hr />   The word
caucus, and its derivative caucusing, are often used in Boston. The last answers much to what we
stile parliamenteering or electioneering. All my repeated applications to different gentlemen have
not furnished me with a satisfactory account of the origin of caucus. It seems to mean, a number of
persons, whether more or less, met together to consult upon adopting and prosecuting some scheme of
policy, for carrying a favorite point. [William Gordon, History, Rise, Progress, and Establishment
of the Independence of the United States of America, London, 1788]


primary (n.)

1861, American English, short for primary election (1792, with reference to France; in a U.S.
context from 1835); earlier primary caucus (1821).
