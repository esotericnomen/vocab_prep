rapport (n.)

1660s, reference, relation, relationship, from French rapport bearing, yield, produce; harmony,
agreement, intercourse, back-formation from rapporter bring back; refer to, from re- again (see re-)
+ apporter to bring, from Latin apportare to bring, from ad- to (see ad-) + portare to carry (see
port (n.1)).    Psychological meaning intense harmonious accord, as between therapist and patient,
is first attested 1894, though the word had been used in a very similar sense with reference to
mesmerism from 1845 (first recorded in Poe). See also report (n.). Johnson frowns on the word and
credits its use in English to Sir William Temple, naturalizer of French terms, who did use it but
was not the first to do so.
