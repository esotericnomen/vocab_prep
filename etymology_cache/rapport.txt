1660s, reference, relation, relationship, from French rapport bearing, yield, produce; harmony,
agreement, intercourse, back-formation from rapporter bring back; refer to, from re- again (see <a
href=/index.php?term=re-&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>re-</a>) + apporter to bring,
from Latin apportare to bring, from ad- to (see <a href=/index.php?term=ad-&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>ad-</a>) + portare to carry (see <a
href=/index.php?term=port&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>port</a> (n.1)).  <br /><br />
Psychological meaning intense harmonious accord, as between therapist and patient, is first attested
1894, though the word had been used in a very similar sense with reference to mesmerism from 1845
(first recorded in Poe). See also <a href=/index.php?term=report&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>report</a> (n.). Johnson frowns on the word and credits its use in English to
Sir William Temple, naturalizer of French terms, who did use it but was not the first to do so.
