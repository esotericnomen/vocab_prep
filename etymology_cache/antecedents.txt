dyke (n.)

1931, American English, perhaps a shortening of morphadike, dialectal garbling of hermaphrodite; but
bulldyker engage in lesbian activities is attested from 1921, and a source from 1896 lists dyke as
slang for the vulva.  <blockquote>  [T]he word appears first in the long forms, bulldiker and
bulldyking, both used in the 1920s by American blacks. No African antecedents have been found for
the term, however, which leads to the possibility that this is basically just another backcountry,
barnyard word, perhaps a combination of BULL and DICK. [Rawson]  </blockquote>
