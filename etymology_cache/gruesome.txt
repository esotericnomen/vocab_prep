+ Middle English gruen feel horror, shudder (c.1300); not recorded in Old English or Norse, possibly
from Middle Dutch gruwen or Middle Low German gruwen shudder with fear (compare German grausam
cruel), or from a Scandinavian source (such as Danish grusom cruel, grue to dread, though others
hold that these are Low German loan-words). One of the many Scottish words popularized in England by
Scott's novels.
