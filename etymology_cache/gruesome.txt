gruesome (adj.)

1560s, with -some (1) + Middle English gruen feel horror, shudder (c.1300); not recorded in Old
English or Norse, possibly from Middle Dutch gruwen or Middle Low German gruwen shudder with fear
(compare German grausam cruel), or from a Scandinavian source (such as Danish grusom cruel, grue to
dread, though others hold that these are Low German loan-words). One of the many Scottish words
popularized in England by Scott's novels.
