hurtle (v.)

early 14c., hurteln, to crash together; to crash down, knock down, probably frequentative of hurten
(see hurt (v.)) in its original sense. Intransitive meaning to rush, dash, charge is late 14c. The
essential notion in hurtle is that of forcible collision, in hurl that of forcible projection.
Related: Hurtled; hurtling.


hurl (v.)

early 13c., hurlen, to run against (each other), come into collision, later throw forcibly (c.1300);
rush violently (late 14c.); perhaps related to Low German hurreln to throw, to dash, and East
Frisian hurreln to roar, to bluster. OED suggests all are from an imitative Germanic base *hurr
expressing rapid motion; see also hurry. The noun is attested from late 14c., originally rushing
water. For difference between hurl and hurtle (which apparently were confused since early Middle
English) see hurtle.


hurt (v.)

c.1200, to injure, wound (the body, feelings, reputation, etc.), also to stumble (into), bump into;
charge against, rush, crash into; knock (things) together, from Old French hurter to ram, strike,
collide, perhaps from Frankish *hurt ram (cognates: Middle High German hurten run at, collide, Old
Norse hrutr ram). The English usage is as old as the French, and perhaps there was a native Old
English *hyrtan, but it has not been recorded. Meaning to be a source of pain (of a body part) is
from 1850. To hurt (one's) feelings attested by 1779. Sense of knock died out 17c., but compare
hurtle. Other Germanic languages tend to use their form of English scathe in this sense (Danish
skade, Swedish skada, German schaden, Dutch schaden).
