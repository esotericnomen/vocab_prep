craven (adj.)

early 13c., cravant, perhaps from Old French crevante defeated, past participle of cravanter to
strike down, to fall down, from Latin crepare to crack, creak. Sense affected by crave and moved
from defeated to cowardly (c.1400) perhaps via intermediary sense of confess oneself defeated.
Related: Cravenly; cravenness.


recreant (n.)

one who yields in combat, one who begs for mercy, one who admits defeat, early 15c., hence coward,
faint-hearted wretch; from recreant (adj.) and from Old French recreant as a noun, one who
acknowledges defeat, a craven, coward, renegade, traitor, wretch. In English, sense of apostate,
deserter, villain is from 1560s.


hang (n.)

late 15c., a sling, from hang (v.). Meaning a curtain is from c.1500; that of the way cloth hangs is
from 1797. To get the hang of (something) become capable is from 1834, American English. Perhaps
originally in reference to a certain tool or feat, but, if so, its origin has been forgotten. It
doesn't seem to have been originally associated with drapery or any other special use of hang.
'To get the hang of a thing,' is to get the knack, or habitual facility of doing it well. A low
expression frequently heard among us. In the Craven Dialect of England is the word hank, a habit;
from which this word hang may perhaps be derived. [John Russell Bartlett, Dictionary of
Americanisms, New York, 1848]
