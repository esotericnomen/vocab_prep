bawdy (adj.)

late 14c., soiled, dirty, filthy, from bawd + -y (2). Meaning lewd is from 1510s, from notion of
pertaining to or befitting a bawd; usually of language (originally to talk bawdy).  Bawdy Basket,

stew (n.)

c.1300, vessel for cooking, from stew (v.). Later heated room, especially for bathing (late 14c.).
The meaning stewed meat with vegetables is first recorded 1756. The obsolete slang meaning brothel
(mid-14c., usually plural, stews) is from a parallel sense of public bath house (mid-14c.), carried
over from Old French estuve bath, bath house; bawdy house, reflecting the reputation of medieval
bath houses.


brothel (n.)

bawdy house, 1590s, shortened from brothel-house, from brothel prostitute (late 15c.), earlier vile,
worthless person of either sex (14c.), from Old English bro&eth;en past participle of breo&eth;an
deteriorate, go to ruin, from Proto-Germanic *breuthan to be broken up, related to *breutan to break
(see brittle). In 16c. brothel-house was confused with unrelated bordel (see bordello) and the word
shifted meaning from a person to a place.
