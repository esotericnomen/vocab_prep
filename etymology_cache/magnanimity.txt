magnanimity (n.)

mid-14c., loftiness of thought or purpose, from Old French magnanimit&#233; high-mindedness,
generosity of spirit, from Latin magnanimitatem (nominative magnanimitas) greatness of soul, high-
mindedness, from magnanimus having a great soul, from magnus great (see magnate) + animus mind,
soul, spirit (see animus). Probably a loan-translation of Greek megalopsykhos high-souled, generous
(Aristotle) or megathymus great-hearted.
