drib (n.)

drop, c.1730, Scottish, perhaps from dribble.


drivel (v.)

Old English dreflian to dribble or run at the nose, slobber, from Proto-Germanic *drab-, from PIE
*dher- (1) to make muddy, darken. Meaning to speak nonsense is mid-14c. Related: Driveling,

slaver (v.)

slobber (v.)). Related: Slavered; slavering. The noun is from early 14c.


lack (n.)

c.1300, absence, want; shortage, deficiency, perhaps from an unrecorded Old English *lac, or else
borrowed from Middle Dutch lak deficiency, fault; in either case from Proto-Germanic *laka-
(cognates: Old Frisian lek disadvantage, damage, Old Norse lakr lacking), from PIE *leg- to dribble,
trickle (see leak (v.)). Middle English also had lackless without blame or fault.


leak (v.)

to let water in or out [Johnson], late 14c., from Middle Dutch leken to drip, to leak, or from Old
Norse leka, both of them related to Old English leccan to moisten (which did not survive into Middle
English), all from Proto-Germanic *lek- deficiency (cognates: Old High German lecchen to become dry,
German lechzen to be parched with thirst), from PIE root *leg- to dribble, trickle. The figurative
meaning come to be known in spite of efforts at concealment dates from at least 1832; transitive
sense first recorded 1859. Related: Leaked; leaking.
