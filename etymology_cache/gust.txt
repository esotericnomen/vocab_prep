gush, spurt) or Old High German gussa flood, both from Proto-Germanic *gustiz, from PIE *gheus-,
from root *gheu- to pour (see found (2)). Probably originally in English as a nautical term. As a
verb, from 1813. Related: Gusted; gusting.


squall (n.)

(compare Norwegian skval sudden rush of water, Swedish skvala to gush, pour down), probably
ultimately a derivative of squall (v.).
