leaven (v.)

c.1400, from leaven (n.). Related: Leavened; leavening.


bread (n.)

Old English bread bit, crumb, morsel; bread, cognate with Old Norse brau&eth;, Danish br&oslash;d,
Old Frisian brad, Middle Dutch brot, Dutch brood, German Brot. According to one theory [Watkins,
etc.] from Proto-Germanic *brautham, which would be from the root of brew (v.) and refer to the
leavening.    But OED argues at some length for the basic sense being not cooked food but piece of
food, and the Old English word deriving from a Proto-Germanic *braudsmon- fragments, bits (cognate
with Old High German brosma crumb, Old English breotan to break in pieces) and being related to the
root of break (v.). It cites  Slovenian kruh bread, literally a piece.    Either way, by c.1200 it
had replaced the usual Old English word for bread, which was hlaf (see loaf (n.)). Slang meaning
money dates from 1940s, but compare breadwinner. Bread-and-butter in the figurative sense of basic
needs is from 1732. Bread and circuses (1914) is from Latin, in reference to food and entertainment
provided by governments to keep the populace happy. Duas tantum res anxius optat, Panem et circenses
[Juvenal, Sat. x.80].
