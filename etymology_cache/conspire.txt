late 14c., from Old French conspirer (14c.), from Latin conspirare to agree, unite, plot, literally
to breathe together, from com- together (see <a href=/index.php?term=com-&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>com-</a>) + spirare to breathe (see <a
href=/index.php?term=spirit&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>spirit</a> (n.)). Or perhaps
the notion is to blow together musical instruments, i.e., To sound in unison. Related: Conspired;
