tirade (n.)

a long, vehement speech, a 'volley of words,'  1801, from French tirade a volley, a shot; a pull; a
long speech or passage; a drawing out (16c.), from tirer draw out, endure, suffer, or the French
noun is perhaps from or influenced by cognate Italian tirata a volley, from past participle of
tirare to draw. The whole Romanic word group is of uncertain origin. Barnhart suggests it is a
shortening of the source of Old French martirer endure martyrdom (see martyr).
