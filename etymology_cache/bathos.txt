bathos (n.)

anticlimax, a descent from the sublime to the ridiculous, 1727, from Greek bathos depth, related to
bathys deep (see benthos). Introduced by Pope.


batholith (n.)

1903, from German batholith (1892), coined by German geologist Eduard Suess (1831-1914) from Greek
bathos depth (see benthos) + -lith stone.


benthos (n.)

life forms of the deep ocean and sea floor, 1891, coined by Haeckel from Greek benthos depth of the
sea, related to bathos depth, bathys deep, of unknown origin. Adjective benthic is attested from
1902.


abyss (n.)

late 14c., earlier abime (c.1300, from a form in Old French), from Late Latin abyssus bottomless
pit, from Greek abyssos (limne) bottomless (pool), from a- without (see a- (2)) + byssos bottom,
possibly related to bathos depth.


bathetic (adj.)

1834, from bathos on the model of pathetic, which, however, does not come directly from pathos (see
pathetic), so the formation is either erroneous or humorous. Bathotic (1863, perhaps on model of
chaotic) is not much better.
