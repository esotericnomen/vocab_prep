resume (v.)).


governmentalism (n.)

disposition to enlarge the power and scope of the government, 1841, from governmental + -ism;
originally in reference to France and perhaps from French.    Besides this, it is a well known fact,
one made sufficiently clear by the history of the United States, that the less governmentalism there
is in a country, the better it is for the citizens as to their material interests. A very
complicated governmental apparatus, when, especially, it is useless, is and can be only hurtful to
the interests of the mass of the people. [Amedee H. Simonin, Resumption of Specie Payments, 1868]
