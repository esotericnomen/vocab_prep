basking (adj.)

1742, present participle adjective from bask (v.). Basking shark is recorded from 1769.


bask (v.)

late 14c., basken to wallow (in blood), with loss of middle syllable, from Old Norse ba&eth;ask to
bathe oneself, reflexive of ba&eth;a bathe (see bathe). Modern meaning soak up a flood of warmth is
apparently due to Shakespeare's use of the word in reference to sunshine in As You Like It (1600).
Related: Basked; basking.


apricate (v.)

1690s, to bask in the sun, from Latin apricatus, past participle of apricari to bask in the sun,
from apricus exposed (to the sun); perhaps contracted from *apericus, from aperire to open (see
overt). Transitive sense is recorded from 1851.


beek (v.)

to bask in the warmth of something, early 13c., a northern and Scottish word of unknown origin;
perhaps ultimately connected to bake (v.).


box (n.2.)

a blow, c.1300, of uncertain origin, possibly related to Middle Dutch boke, Middle High German buc,
and Danish bask, all meaning a blow, perhaps imitative.


-sk

reflexive suffix in words of Danish origin (such as bask, literally to bathe oneself), contracted
from Old Norse sik, reflexive pronoun corresponding to Gothic sik, Old High German sih, German sich
himself, herself, itself, from PIE root *s(w)e- (source of Latin se himself; see idiom).
