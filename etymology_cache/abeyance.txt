abeyance (n.)

1520s, from Anglo-French abeiance suspension, also expectation (especially in a lawsuit), from Old
French abeance aspiration, desire, noun of condition of abeer aspire after, gape from &agrave; at
(see ad-) + ba(y)er be open, from Latin *batare to yawn, gape (see abash).    Originally in French a
legal term, condition of a person in expectation or hope of receiving property; it turned around in
English law to mean condition of property temporarily without an owner (1650s). Root baer is also
the source of English bay (n.2) recessed space, as in bay window.


suspense (n.)

c.1400, abeyance, temporary cessation; state of not being carried out (of legal matters), from
Anglo-French suspens (in en suspens in abeyance, c.1300), Old French sospense delay, deferment (of
judgement), act of suspending, from Latin suspensus, past participle of suspendere to hang up;
interrupt (see suspend). Meaning state of mental uncertainty with more or less anxiety (mid-15c.) is
from legal meaning, perhaps via notion of awaiting an expected decision, or from state of having the
mind or thoughts suspended. As a genre of novels, stories, etc., attested from 1951.
