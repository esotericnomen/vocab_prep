cumbersome (adj.)

late 14c., from cumber (v.) + -some (1). Meaning unwieldy, hard to carry is from 1590s. Related:
Cumbersomely; cumbersomeness.


cumber (v.)

c.1300, to overthrow, destroy; to be overwhelmed; to harass, apparently from French, but Old French
combrer to seize hold of, lay hands on, grab, snatch, take by force, rape, has not quite the same
sense. Perhaps a shortened formation from a verb akin to Middle English acombren obstructing
progress, from Old French encombrer, from combre obstruction, barrier, from Vulgar Latin *comboros
that which is carried together, perhaps from a Gaulish word.    The likely roots are PIE *kom (see
com-) + *bher- (1) to bear (see infer). Weakened sense of to hamper, to obstruct or weigh down is
late 14c. Related: Cumbered; cumbering.


cumbrous (adj.)

late 14c., cumbersome, troublesome, clumsy, unwieldy, from cumber + -ous.
