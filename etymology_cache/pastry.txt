mid-15c., food made with paste, not originally limited to sweets, from Middle English paste (see <a
href=/index.php?term=paste&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>paste</a> (n.)) + <a
href=/index.php?term=-ry&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>-ry</a>. Probably influenced by
Old French pastaierie pastry (Modern French p&#226;tisserie), from pastoier pastry cook, from paste
(see <a href=/index.php?term=paste&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>paste</a> (n.)); also
borrowed from Medieval Latin pasteria pastry, from Latin pasta. Specific sense of small confection
made of pastry is from 1906. Pastry-cook attested from 1712.
