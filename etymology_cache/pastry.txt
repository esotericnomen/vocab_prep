pastry (n.)

mid-15c., food made with paste, not originally limited to sweets, from Middle English paste (see
paste (n.)) + -ry. Probably influenced by Old French pastaierie pastry (Modern French
p&#226;tisserie), from pastoier pastry cook, from paste (see paste (n.)); also borrowed from
Medieval Latin pasteria pastry, from Latin pasta. Specific sense of small confection made of pastry
is from 1906. Pastry-cook attested from 1712.
