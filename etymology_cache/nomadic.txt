inhabited the region around the Crimea, and who, according to Assyrian sources, overran Asia Minor
7c. B.C.E.; from Latin Cimmerius, from Greek Kimmerios. Homer described their land as a place of
perpetual mist and darkness beyond the ocean, but whether he had in mind the same people Herodotus
did, or any real place, is unclear.

Greek Araps (genitive Arabos), from Arabic 'arab, indigenous name of the people, perhaps literally

rest (n.1)

sleep, Old English r&aelig;ste, reste rest, bed, intermission of labor, mental peace, common
Germanic (Old Saxon resta resting place, burial-place, Dutch rust, Old High German rasta, German
Rast rest, peace, repose), of uncertain origin.    Original sense seems to be a measure of distance
(compare Old High German rasta, which in addition to rest meant league of miles, Old Norse rost
league, distance after which one rests, Gothic rasta mile, stage of a journey), perhaps a word from
the nomadic period. Unless the original sense is repose, thence extended secondarily to distance
between two resting place.    The meaning support, thing upon which something rests is attested from
1580s. At rest dead is from mid-14c., on the notion of last rest. Rest stop is from 1973. Colloquial
expression to give (something) a rest to stop talking about it is first recorded 1927, American
English.
