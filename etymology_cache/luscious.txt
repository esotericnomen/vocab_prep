luscious (adj.)

late 15c., perhaps a variant (with form perhaps influenced by Old French luxure, lusure) of Middle
English licius delicious (c.1400), which is perhaps a shortening of delicious, but OED is against
this. Related: Lusciously; lusciousness.


bergamot (n.)

type of citrus tree, also its fruit, both similar to bitter orange, and the essence prepared from
the oil of the rind of the fruit, 1690s, from French bergamote (17c.), from Italian bergamotta,
named for Bergamo, town in Italy. The name is Roman Bergamum, from a Celtic or Ligurian berg
mountain, cognate with the identical Germanic word.    Earlier (1610s) as a kind of pear deemed
especially luscious, in this sense ultimately a Romanic folk-etymologization from Turkish beg-armudi
prince's pear or prince of pears, influenced in form by the other word, but probably not from it
(the town is on the opposite end of the peninsula from where the pear grows). Also used of garden
plants of the mint order with a smell like that of oil of bergamot.
