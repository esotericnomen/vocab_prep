illegitimate child, early 13c., from Old French bastard (11c., Modern French b&acirc;tard),
acknowledged child of a nobleman by a woman other than his wife, probably from fils de bast
packsaddle son, meaning a child conceived on an improvised bed (saddles often doubled as beds while
traveling), with pejorative ending -art (see <a href=/index.php?term=-ard&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>-ard</a>). Alternative possibly is that the word is from Proto-Germanic
*banstiz barn, equally suggestive of low origin.  <br /><br />  Not always regarded as a stigma; the
Conqueror is referred to in state documents as William the Bastard. Figurative sense of something
not pure or genuine is late 14c.; use as a vulgar term of abuse for a man is attested from 1830. As
an adjective from late 14c. Among the bastard words in Halliwell-Phillipps' Dictionary of Archaic
and Provincial Words are avetrol, chance-bairn, by-blow, harecoppe, horcop, and gimbo (a bastard's
bastard).
