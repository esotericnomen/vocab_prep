mourn (v.)

Old English murnan to mourn, bemoan, long after, also be anxious about, be careful (class III strong
verb; past tense mearn, past participle murnen), from Proto-Germanic *murnan to remember sorrowfully
(cognates: Old Saxon mornon, Old High German mornen, Gothic maurnan to mourn, Old Norse morna to
pine away), probably from PIE root *(s)mer- to remember (see memory); or, if the Old Norse sense is
the base one, from *mer- to die, wither. Related: Mourned; mourning.
