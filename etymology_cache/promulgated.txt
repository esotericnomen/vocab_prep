promulgate (v.)

1520s, from Latin promulgatus, past participle of promulgare make publicly known, propose openly,
publish, perhaps altered from provulgare, from pro- forth (see pro-) + vulgare make public, publish.
Or the second element might be from mulgere to milk (see milk (n.)), used metaphorically for cause
to emerge; a picturesque farmers' term used originally of squeezing the milk from the udder [L.R.
Palmer, The Latin Language]. Related: Promulgated; promulgating. The earlier verb in English was
promulge (late 15c.).
