ill-tempered person, 1896, earlier state of irritable glumness (1890, in expressions such as to have
a grouch on), U.S. college student slang, of uncertain origin, possibly from grutching complaint,
grumbling (see <a href=/index.php?term=grutch&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>grutch</a>).   <blockquote>  The Grouch, on the other Hand, gave a correct
Imitation of a Bear with a Sore Toe. His Conversation was largely made up of Grunts. He carried a
Facial Expression that frightened little Children in Street Cars and took all the Starch out of
sentimental Young Ladies. He seemed perpetually to carry the Hoof-Marks of a horrible Nightmare.
[George Ade, People You Know, 1902]  </blockquote>  The verb is 1916, from the noun. Related:
Grouched; grouching. Grouch bag purse for carrying hidden money (1908) is the source of the nickname
of U.S. comedian Julius Groucho Marx (1890-1977), who supposedly carried his money in one to poker
games.
