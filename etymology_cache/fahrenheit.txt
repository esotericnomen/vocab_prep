Fahrenheit

temperature scale, 1753, named for Gabriel Daniel Fahrenheit (1686-1736), Prussian physicist who
proposed the scale in 1714. The zero in it is arbitrary, based on the lowest temperature observed by
him in the winter of 1709. An abstract surname meaning literally experience.


eighties (n.)

1827 as the years of someone's life between ages 80 and 89; from 1833 as the ninth decade of years
in a given century; from 1854 with reference to Fahrenheit temperature. See eighty.


thermometer (n.)

1630s, from French thermom&egrave;tre (1620s), coined by Jesuit Father Jean Leur&eacute;chon from
Greek thermos hot (see thermal) + metron measure (see meter (n.2)). An earlier, Latinate form was
thermoscopium (1610s). The earliest such device was Galileo's air-thermometer, invented c.1597. The
typical modern version, with mercury in glass, was invented by Fahrenheit in 1714. Related:
Thermometric; thermometrical.


nineties (n.)

1857 as the years of someone's life between 90 and 99; from 1848 as the tenth decade of years in a
given century; 1849 with reference to Fahrenheit temperature. See ninety.    Many still live who
remember those days; if the old men cannot tell you the exact date, they will say: 'It were in the
nineties;' (etc.) [Chambers's Journal, Nov. 1, 1856]    In Britain, the naughty nineties was a
popular name 1920s-30s for the 1890s, based on the notion of a relaxing of morality and mood in
contrast to earlier Victorian times. In U.S., gay nineties in reference to the same decade is
attested from 1927, and was the title of a regular nostalgia feature in Life magazine about that
time.    The long, dreary blue-law Sunday afternoons were periods of the Nineties which no amount of
rosy retrospect will ever be able to recall as gay, especially to a normal healthy boy to whom all
activities were taboo except G. A. Henty and the bound volumes of Leslie's Weekly of the Civil War.
