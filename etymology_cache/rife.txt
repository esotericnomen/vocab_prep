Old English rife abundant, common, prevalent, from Proto-Germanic *rif- (cognates: Old Norse rifr,
Swedish river, Norwegian riv, Middle Dutch riif, Middle Low German rive abundant, generous), said to
be from PIE root *rei- to scratch, tear, cut The prevalence of the word in early southern texts is
in favour of its being native in English, rather than an adoption from Scandinavian. [OED]
