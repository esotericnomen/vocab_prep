hut (n.)

1650s, from French hutte cottage (16c.), from Middle High German h&uuml;tte cottage, hut, probably
from Proto-Germanic *hudjon-, related to the root of Old English hydan to hide, from PIE *keudh-,
from root (s)keu- (see hide (n.1)). Apparently first in English as a military word. Old Saxon hutta,
Danish hytte, Swedish hytta, Frisian and Middle Dutch hutte, Dutch hut are from High German.
