upbeat (adj.)

with a positive mood, 1947, apparently from on the upbeat improving, getting better, attested from
1934 and a favorite of Billboard headline-writers in the early 1940s, from the musical noun upbeat
(1869), referring to the beat of a bar at which the conductor's baton is in a raised position; from
up (adv.) + beat (n.). The optimistic sense apparently for no other reason than that it sounds like
a happy word (the musical upbeat is no more inherently positive than any other beat).
