upbeat (adj.)

with a positive mood, 1947, apparently from on the upbeat improving, getting better, attested from
1934 and a favorite of Billboard headline-writers in the early 1940s, from the musical noun upbeat
(1869), referring to the beat of a bar at which the conductor's baton is in a raised position; from
up (adv.) + beat (n.). The optimistic sense apparently for no other reason than that it sounds like
a happy word (the musical upbeat is no more inherently positive than any other beat).


cheerio

upbeat parting exclamation, British, 1910, from cheer.


downbeat

1876 (n.), in reference to downward stroke of a conductor's baton; 1952 (adj.) in figurative sense
of pessimistic, but that is probably via associations of the word down (adv.), because the beat
itself is no more pessimistic than the upbeat is optimistic.
