c.1300, vitaylle (singular), from Anglo-French and Old French vitaille food, nourishment,
provisions, from Late Latin victualia provisions, noun use of plural of victualis of nourishment,
from victus livelihood, food, sustenance, that which sustains life, from past participle stem of
vivere to live (see <a href=/index.php?term=vital&amp;allowed_in_frame=0

pronunciation remains vittles.
