girth (n.)

c.1300, belt around a horse's body, from Old Norse gjor&eth; girdle, belt, hoop, from Proto-Germanic
*gertu- (cf Gothic gairda girdle), from the same source as gird. Sense of measurement around an
object first recorded 1640s.


surcingle (n.)

girth for a horse or other animal, late 14c., from Old French surcengle, from sur- over (see sur-
(1)) + cengle a girdle, from Latin cingulum girth (see cinch (n.)).


cinch (n.)

1859, American English, saddle-girth, from Spanish cincha girdle, from Latin cingulum a girdle, a
swordbelt, from cingere to surround, encircle, from PIE root *kenk- (1) to gird, encircle (cognates:
Sanskrit kankate binds, kanci girdle; Lithuanian kinkau to harness horses). Replaced earlier
surcingle. Sense of an easy thing is 1898, via notion of a sure hold (1888).


volume (n.)

late 14c., roll of parchment containing writing; a bound book, from Old French volume scroll, book;
work, volume; girth, size (13c.) and directly from Latin volumen (genitive voluminis) roll (of a
manuscript); coil, wreath, literally that which is rolled, from volvere to turn around, roll (see
volvox). Meaning book forming part of a set is 1520s in English, from that sense in French.
Generalized sense of bulk, mass, quantity (1620s) developed from that of bulk or size of a book
(1520s), again following the sense evolution in the French word.
