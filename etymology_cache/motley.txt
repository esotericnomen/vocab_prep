late 14c., parti-colored (originally of fabric), from Anglo-French motteley, probably from Old
English mot speck (see <a href=/index.php?term=mote&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>mote</a>). But Klein's sources say probably from Gaulish. Diversified in color,
especially of a fool's dress. Hence, allusively, a fool (1600). As a noun meaning cloth of mixed
color from late 14c.
