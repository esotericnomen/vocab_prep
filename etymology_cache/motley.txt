motley (adj.)

English mot speck (see mote). But Klein's sources say probably from Gaulish. Diversified in color,
especially of a fool's dress. Hence, allusively, a fool (1600). As a noun meaning cloth of mixed
color from late 14c.

varicolored (adj.)

diversified in color, motley, also vari-colored, 1660s, from Latin varius (see vary) + English

yew (n.)

evergreen tree of temperate Europe and Asia, Old English iw, eow yew, from Proto-Germanic *iwo-
(cognates: Middle Dutch iwe, Dutch ijf, Old High German iwa, German Eibe, Old Norse yr), from PIE
*ei-wo- (cognates: Old Irish eo, Welsh ywen yew), perhaps a suffixed form of root *ei- (2) reddish,
motley, yellow.    OED says French if, Spanish iva, Medieval Latin ivus are from Germanic (and says
Dutch ijf is from French); others posit a Gaulish ivos as the source of these. Lithuanian jeva
likewise is said to be from Germanic. The tree symbolizes both death and immortality, being
poisonous as well as long-lived. Reference to its wood as well-suited to making bows dates from
c.1400.
