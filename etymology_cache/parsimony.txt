early 15c., from Latin parsimonia sparingness, frugality, thrift, from pars-, past participle stem
of parsi, perfect tense of parcere to spare, save, refrain from, use moderately (which is said to be
unrelated to Latin parvus small, parum too little) + -monia, suffix signifying action, state, or
condition.
