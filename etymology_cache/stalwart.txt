stalwart (adj.)

late 14c., resolute, determined, Scottish variant of stalworth, from Old English
st&aelig;lwier&eth;e good, serviceable, probably a contracted compound of sta&eth;ol base,
foundation, support; stability, security (from Proto-Germanic *stathlaz, from PIE root *sta- to
stand, set down, make or be firm; see stet) + wier&eth;e good, excellent, worthy (see worth).
Another theory traces the first element of st&aelig;lwier&eth;e to Old English st&aelig;l place,
from Proto-Germanic *st&aelig;laz.
