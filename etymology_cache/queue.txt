queue (n.)

late 15c., band attached to a letter with seals dangling on the free end, from French queue a tail,
from Old French cue, coe tail (12c., also penis), from Latin coda (dialectal variant or alternative
form of cauda) tail, of unknown origin. Also in literal use in 16c. English, tail of a beast,
especially in heraldry. The Middle English metaphoric extension to line of dancers (c.1500) led to
extended sense of line of people, etc. (1837). Also used 18c. in sense of braid of hair hanging down
behind (first attested 1748).
