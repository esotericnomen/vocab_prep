1797, from French antagonisme or directly from late Greek antagonisma, noun of action from
antagonizesthai to struggle against (see antagonist).


opposition (n.)

late 14c., an astrological term for the situation of two heavenly bodies exactly across from one
another in the heavens, from Old French oposicion (12c.) or directly from Latin oppositionem
(nominative oppositio) act of opposing, a placing against, noun of action from past participle stem
of opponere set against (see opponent). Meaning that which is opposite something else is from 1540s;
meaning contrast, antagonism first attested 1580s; sense of political party opposed to the one in

exploitation (n.)

1803, productive working of something, a positive word among those who used it first, though
regarded as a Gallicism, from French exploitation, noun of action from exploiter (see exploit (v.)).
Bad sense developed 1830s-50s, in part from influence of French socialist writings (especially Saint
Simon), also perhaps influenced by U.S. anti-slavery writing; and the insulting word was hurled at
activities it once had crowned as praise.    It follows from this science [conceived by Saint
Simon] that the tendency of the human race is from a state of antagonism to that of an universal
peaceful association -- from the dominating influence of the military spirit to that of the
industriel one; from what they call l'exploitation de l'homme par l'homme to the exploitation of the
globe by industry. [Quarterly Review, April &amp; July 1831]
