decipher (v.)

1520s, from de- + cipher. Perhaps in part a loan-translation from Middle French d&eacute;chiffrer.
Related: Deciphered; deciphering.


moniker (n.)

1849, said to be originally a hobo term (but attested in London underclass from 1851), of uncertain
origin; perhaps from monk (monks and nuns take new names with their vows, and early 19c. British
tramps referred to themselves as in the monkery). Its origins seem always to have been obscure:
Sir H. Rawlinson can decipher cuneiform, but can he tell us why moniker--the word has a certain
Coptic or Egyptian twang--means a name painted on a trunk? [The Saturday Review, Dec. 19, 1857]


undecipherable (adj.)

1758, from un- (1) not + decipherable (see decipher (v.)).


indecipherable (adj.)

1802, from in- (1) not + decipherable (see decipher (v.)). Related: Indecipherability.


Rosetta Stone (n.)

discovered 1798 at Rosetta, Egypt; now in British Museum. Dating to 2c. B.C.E., its trilingual
inscription helped Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois Champollion decipher Egyptian demotic and hieroglyphics in
1822, which opened the way to study of all early Egyptian records. Hence, figurative use of the term
to mean something which provides the key to previously unattainable understanding (1902). The place
name is the European form of Rashid, a name given because it was founded c.800 C.E. by Caliph Harun
ar-Rashid.
