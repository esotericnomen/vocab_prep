also blow-hard, 1840, a sailor's word (from 1790 as a nickname for a sailor), perhaps not originally
primarily meaning braggart; from <a href=/index.php?term=blow&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>blow</a> (v.1) + <a href=/index.php?term=hard&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>hard</a> (adv.). An adjective sense of boastful appeared c.1855, and may be a
separate formation leading to a modified noun use.
