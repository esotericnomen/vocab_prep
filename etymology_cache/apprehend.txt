mid-14c., to grasp in the senses or mind, from Old French aprendre (12c.) teach; learn; take, grasp;
acquire, or directly from Latin apprehendere to take hold of, grasp, from ad- to + prehendere to
seize (see <a href=/index.php?term=prehensile&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>prehensile</a>). Metaphoric extension to seize with the mind took place in
Latin, and was the sole sense of cognate Old French aprendre (Modern French apprendre to learn, to
be informed about; also compare <a href=/index.php?term=apprentice&amp;allowed_in_frame=0

name of the law, arrest, recorded from 1540s, which use probably was taken directly from Latin.
