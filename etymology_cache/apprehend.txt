apprehend (v.)

mid-14c., to grasp in the senses or mind, from Old French aprendre (12c.) teach; learn; take, grasp;
acquire, or directly from Latin apprehendere to take hold of, grasp, from ad- to + prehendere to
seize (see prehensile). Metaphoric extension to seize with the mind took place in Latin, and was the
sole sense of cognate Old French aprendre (Modern French apprendre to learn, to be informed about;
also compare apprentice). Original sense returned in English in meaning to seize in the name of the
law, arrest, recorded from 1540s, which use probably was taken directly from Latin. Related:
Apprehended; apprehending.
