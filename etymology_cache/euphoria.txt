euphoria (n.)

1727, a physician's term for condition of feeling healthy and comfortable (especially when sick),
medical Latin, from Greek euphoria power of enduring easily, from euphoros, literally bearing well,
from eu well (see eu-) + pherein to carry (see infer). Non-technical use, now the main one, dates to
1882 and is perhaps a reintroduction.

eccentric person disconnected with reality (often implying an intimacy with hallucinogenic drugs) is

which was watched by many children who dreamed of growing up to be one and succeeded. Related:
