mentor (n.)

wise advisor, 1750, from Greek Mentor, friend of Odysseus and adviser of Telemachus (but often
actually Athene in disguise) in the Odyssey, perhaps ultimately meaning  adviser, because the name
appears to be an agent noun of mentos intent, purpose, spirit, passion from PIE *mon-eyo- (cognates:
Sanskrit man-tar- one who thinks, Latin mon-i-tor one who admonishes), causative form of root *men-
to think (see mind (n.)). The general use of the word probably is via later popular romances, in
which Mentor played a larger part than he does in Homer.
