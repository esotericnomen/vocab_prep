mentor (n.)

wise advisor, 1750, from Greek Mentor, friend of Odysseus and adviser of Telemachus (but often
actually Athene in disguise) in the Odyssey, perhaps ultimately meaning  adviser, because the name
appears to be an agent noun of mentos intent, purpose, spirit, passion from PIE *mon-eyo- (cognates:
Sanskrit man-tar- one who thinks, Latin mon-i-tor one who admonishes), causative form of root *men-
to think (see mind (n.)). The general use of the word probably is via later popular romances, in
which Mentor played a larger part than he does in Homer.


mentor (v.)

1888, from mentor (n.). Related: Mentored; mentoring.


guru (n.)

1800, gooroo, from Hindi guru teacher, priest, from Sanskrit guru-s one to be honored, teacher,
literally heavy, weighty, from PIE root *gru- (see grave (adj.)). Generalized sense of mentor is
from 1940; sense of expert in something first recorded c.1966 in Canadian English in reference to
Marshall McLuhan.


al Qaida

also Al-Qaeda; name of a loosely structured jihadist movement founded c.1989 by Osama bin Laden;
from Arabic, literally the base. A common Arabic term among Muslim radicals from the wider Islamic
world who came to Afghanistan in 1980s and fought alongside local rebels against the Soviets, and
who regarded themselves and their struggle not merely in Afghan terms but as the base or foundation
of a wider jihad and revival in Islam. Used by Bin Laden's mentor, Abdallah Azzam (1941-1989), who
referred to the vanguard which constitutes the strong foundation [al-qaida al-sulbah] for the
expected society. In U.S., the term first turns up in a CIA report in 1996.    Every Muslim, from
the moment they realise the distinction in their hearts, hates Americans, hates Jews, and hates
Christians. This is a part of our belief and our religion. For as long as I can remember, I have
felt tormented and at war, and have felt hatred and animosity for Americans. [Osama bin Laden,
interview aired on Al-Jazeera, December 1998]
