lustrous

c.1600, from luster + -ous. Related: Lustrously; lustrousness.


taffeta (n.)

mid-14c., fine, smooth, lustrous silk cloth, also taffata, from Old French taffetas (early 14c.),
from Italian taffeta or Medieval Latin taffata, ultimately from Persian taftah silk or linen cloth,
noun use of past participle of taftan to twist, spin, weave, interlace, from Iranian *tap-. Applied
to different fabrics in different eras (and see tapestry).


beryl (n.)

hard, lustrous mineral, c.1300, from Old French beryl (12c., Modern French b&eacute;ryl), from Latin
beryllus, from Greek beryllos, perhaps from Prakrit veruliya, from Sanskrit vaidurya-, of Dravidian
origin, perhaps from the city of Velur (modern Belur) in southern India.    Medieval Latin berillus
also was applied to any precious stone of a pale green color, to fine crystal, and to eyeglasses
(the first spectacle lenses may have been made of beryl), hence German Brille spectacles, from
Middle High German berille beryl, and French besicles (plural) spectacles, altered 14c. from Old
French bericle.


porcelain (n.)

1530s, from Middle French porcelaine and directly from Italian porcellana porcelain (13c.),
literally cowrie shell, the chinaware so called from resemblance of its lustrous transparency to the
shiny surface of the shells. The shell's name in Italian is from porcella young sow, fem. of Latin
porcellus young pig, diminutive of porculus piglet, diminutive of porcus pig (see pork (n.)).
According to an old theory, the connection of the shell and the pig is a perceived resemblance of
the shell opening to the exposed outer genitalia of pigs.   <b>porcelain</b> is china &amp; china is
p.; there is no recondite difference between the two things, which indeed are not two, but one;
&amp; the difference between the two words is merely that china is the homely term, while porcelain
is exotic &amp; literary. [Fowler]
