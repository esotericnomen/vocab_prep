1570s, from Medieval Latin preternaturalis (mid-13c.), from Latin phrase praeter naturam (praeterque
fatum) beyond nature (and beyond fate), from praeter beyond (see <a
href=/index.php?term=preterite&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>preterite</a>) +
accusative of natura nature (see <a href=/index.php?term=natural&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>natural</a>). Preternatural is used especially to note that which might have
been a work of nature, but is not [Century Dictionary].
