hackneyed (adj.)

1769, kept for hire, past participle adjective from hackney. The figurative sense of trite, so
overused as to have become uninteresting is older, 1749, from hack (n.2) in special sense of one who
writes anything for hire.


banal (adj.)

trite, commonplace, 1840, from French banal, belonging to a manor, common, hackneyed, commonplace,
from Old French banel communal (13c.), from ban decree; legal control; announcement; authorization;
payment for use of a communal oven, mill, etc. (see ban (v.)). The modern sense evolved from the
word's use in designating things like ovens or mills that belonged to feudal serfs, or else
compulsory military service; in either case it was generalized in French through open to everyone to
commonplace, ordinary, to trite, petty.


stale (adj.)

early 13c., freed from dregs or lees (of ale, wine, etc.), probably literally having stood long
enough to clear, ultimately from PIE root *sta- to stand (see stet); probably via Old French estal
placed, fixed position, from Frankish *stal- position (see stall (n.1)). Cognate with Middle Dutch
stel stale (of beer and old urine). Originally a desirable quality (in beer and wine); the meaning
not fresh is first recorded late 15c. Figurative sense (of immaterial things) old and trite,
hackneyed is recorded from 1560s. As a noun, that which has become tasteless by exposure, hence a
prostitute (in Shakespeare, etc.). Related: Staleness.
