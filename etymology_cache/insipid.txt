tasteless, from Latin in- not (see in- (1)) + sapidus tasty, from sapere have a taste (also be wise;
see sapient). Figurative meaning uninteresting, dull first recorded 1640s, but it was also a
secondary sense in Medieval Latin.<blockquote>In ye coach ... went Mrs. Barlow, the King's mistress
and mother to ye Duke of Monmouth, a browne, beautifull, bold, but insipid creature. [John Evelyn,
diary, Aug. 18, 1649]</blockquote>  Related: Insipidly.
