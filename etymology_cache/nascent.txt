aspirin (n.)

coined 1899 by German chemist Heinrich Dreser (1860-1924) in German as a trademark name, from Latin
Spiraea (ulmaria) meadow-sweet, the plant in whose flowers or leaves the processed acid in the
medicine is naturally found, + common chemical ending -in (see -ine (2)). Spiraea (Tournefort, 1700)
is from Latinized form of Greek speiraia meadow-sweet, so called from the shape of its follicles
(see spiral (adj.)). The initial -a- is to acknowledge acetylation; Dreser said the word was a
contraction of acetylierte spirs&auml;ure, the German name of the acid, which now is obsolete,
replaced by salicylic acid.   Die Bezeichnung Aspirin ist abgeleitet aus Spirs&#228;ure -- alter
Name der Salicyls&#228;ure und A = Acetyl; statt Acetylirte Spirs&#228;ure, kurzweg Aspirin. [H,
Dreser, Pharmakologisches &#252;ber Aspirin (Acetylsalicyls&#228;ure), in Archiv f&#252;r die
Gesammte Physiologie des Menschen und der Thiere, 1899, p.307]    The custom of giving commercial
names to medicinal products began in Germany in the late 19th century, when nascent pharmaceutical
firms were discovering medical uses for common, easily made chemicals. To discourage competitors
they would market the substance under a short trademarked name a doctor could remember, rather than
the long chemical compound word. German law required prescriptions to be filled exactly as written.
