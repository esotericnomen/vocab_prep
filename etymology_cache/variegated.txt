sheldrake (n.)

early 14c., from sheld- variegated + drake male duck. First element cognate with Middle Dutch
schillede separated, variegated, West Flemish schilde, from schillen (Dutch verschillen to make
different), from Proto-Germanic *skeli-, from PIE root *(s)kel- (1) to cut (see scale (n.1)). This
is the origin considered most likely, though English sheld by itself is a dialect word attested only
from c.1500. OED finds derivation from  shield (n.), on resemblance to the patterns on shields,
improbable.
