early 14c., from sheld- variegated + <a href=/index.php?term=drake&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>drake</a> male duck. First element cognate with Middle Dutch schillede
separated, variegated, West Flemish schilde, from schillen (Dutch verschillen to make different),
from Proto-Germanic *skeli-, from PIE root *(s)kel- (1) to cut (see <a
href=/index.php?term=scale&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>scale</a> (n.1)). This is the
origin considered most likely, though English sheld by itself is a dialect word attested only from
c.1500. OED finds derivation from  <a href=/index.php?term=shield&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>shield</a> (n.), on resemblance to the patterns on shields, improbable.
