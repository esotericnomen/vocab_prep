secular (adj.)

c.1300, living in the world, not belonging to a religious order, also belonging to the state, from
Old French seculer (Modern French s&#233;culier), from Late Latin saecularis worldly, secular,
pertaining to a generation or age, from Latin saecularis of an age, occurring once in an age, from
saeculum age, span of time, generation.    According to Watkins, this is probably from PIE *sai-
tlo-, with instrumental element *-tlo- + *sai- to bind, tie (see sinew), extended metaphorically to
successive human generations as links in the chain of life. Another theory connects it with words
for seed, from PIE root *se- to sow (see sow (v.), and compare Gothic mana-se&thorn;s mankind,
world, literally seed of men).    Used in ecclesiastical writing like Greek aion of this world (see
cosmos). It is source of French si&egrave;cle. Ancient Roman ludi saeculares was a three-day, day-
and-night celebration coming once in an age (120 years). In English, in reference to humanism and
the exclusion of belief in God from matters of ethics and morality, from 1850s.
