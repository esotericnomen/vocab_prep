c.1300, living in the world, not belonging to a religious order, also belonging to the state, from
Old French seculer (Modern French s&#233;culier), from Late Latin saecularis worldly, secular,
pertaining to a generation or age, from Latin saecularis of an age, occurring once in an age, from
saeculum age, span of time, generation.  <br /><br />  According to Watkins, this is probably from
PIE *sai-tlo-, with instrumental element *-tlo- + *sai- to bind, tie (see <a
href=/index.php?term=sinew&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>sinew</a>), extended
metaphorically to successive human generations as links in the chain of life. Another theory
connects it with words for seed, from PIE root *se- to sow (see <a
href=/index.php?term=sow&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>sow</a> (v.), and compare
Gothic mana-se&thorn;s mankind, world, literally seed of men).  <br /><br />  Used in ecclesiastical
writing like Greek aion of this world (see <a href=/index.php?term=cosmos&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>cosmos</a>). It is source of French si&egrave;cle. Ancient Roman ludi
saeculares was a three-day, day-and-night celebration coming once in an age (120 years). In English,
in reference to humanism and the exclusion of belief in God from matters of ethics and morality,
from 1850s.
