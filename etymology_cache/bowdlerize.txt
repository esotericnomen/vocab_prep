1836, from Thomas Bowdler (1754-1825), English editor who in 1818 published a notorious expurgated
Shakespeare, in which, according to his frontispiece, nothing is added to the original text; but
those words and expressions omitted which cannot with propriety be read aloud in a family. Related:
Bowdlerized; bowdlerizing.
