chasten (v.)

1520s, with -en (1) + the word it replaced, obsolete verb chaste to correct (someone's) behavior
(Middle English chastien, c.1200), from Old French chastiier to punish (see chastise). Related:
Chastened; chastening.


chastise (v.)

c.1300, chastisen, from Old French chastiier to warn, advise, instruct; chastise, admonish; punish;
dominate, tame (12c., Modern French ch&acirc;tier), from Latin castigare to set or keep right, to
reprove, chasten, to punish, literally to make pure (see castigate). Or perhaps from Middle English
chastien (see chasten) + -ise, though this would be early for such a native formation. The form of
the modern word is not easily accounted for [OED]. Related: Chastised; chastising.  He alone may
chastise who loves. [Rabindranath Tagore, The Crescent Moon, 1913]


cleanse (v.)

Old English cl&aelig;nsian to cleanse, purge, purify, chasten, justify, from West Germanic
*klainson, from *klainoz (see clean (adj.)). Despite its modern spelling (16c.), it retains its
Middle English pronunciation. Related: Cleansed; cleansing.
