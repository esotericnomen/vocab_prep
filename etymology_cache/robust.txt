1540s, from Middle French robuste (14c.) and directly from Latin robustus strong and hardy,
literally as strong as oak, originally oaken, from robur, robus hard timber, strength, also a
special kind of oak, named for its reddish heartwood, from Latin ruber red (related to robigo rust),
from PIE *reudh- (see <a href=/index.php?term=red&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>red</a> (adj.1)). Related: Robustly; robustness. Robustious (1540s) was a
common form in 17c. (see Hamlet iii.2); it fell from use by mid-18c., but was somewhat revived by
mid-19c. antiquarian writers.
