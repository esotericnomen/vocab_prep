shamefaced (adj.)

modest, bashful, 1550s, folk etymology alteration of shamefast, from Old English scamf&aelig;st

adjectival suffix (see fast (adj.)). Related: Shamefacedly; shamefacedness.   <b>shamefaced,
-fast</b>. It is true that the second is the original form, that -faced is due to a mistake, &amp;
that the notion attached to the word is necessarily affected in some slight degree by the change.
But those who, in the flush of this discovery, would revert to -fast in ordinary use are rightly
rewarded with the name of pedants .... [Fowler]
