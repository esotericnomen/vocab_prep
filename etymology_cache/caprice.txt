sudden change of mind, 1660s, from French caprice whim (16c.), from Italian capriccio whim,
originally a shivering, possibly from capro goat, with reference to frisking, from Latin capreolus
wild goat (see <a href=/index.php?term=cab&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>cab</a>). But
another theory connects the Italian word with capo head + riccio curl, frizzled, literally hedgehog
(from Latin ericius). The notion in this case would be of the hair standing on end in horror, hence
the person shivering in fear.
