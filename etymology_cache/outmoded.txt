shibboleth (n.)

late 14c., the Hebrew word shibboleth, meaning flood, stream, also ear of corn; in Judges xii:4-6.
It was the password used by the Gileadites to distinguish their own men from fleeing Ephraimites,
because Ephraimites could not pronounce the -sh- sound. Hence the figurative sense of watchword
(first recorded 1630s), which evolved by 1862 to outmoded slogan still adhered to. A similar test-
word was cicera chick pease, used by the Italians to identify the French (who could not pronounce it
correctly) during the massacre called the Sicilian Vespers (1282).


cling (v.)

Old English clingan hold fast, adhere closely; congeal, shrivel (strong verb, past tense clang, past
participle clungen), from Proto-Germanic *klingg- (cognates: Danish klynge to cluster; Old High

clench; German Klinke latch).    The main sense shifted in Middle English to adhere to (something
else), stick together. Of persons in embrace, c.1600. Figuratively (to hopes, outmoded ideas, etc.),
from 1580s. Of clothes from 1792. Related: Clung; clinging.
