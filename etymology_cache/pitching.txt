wind-up (n.)

1570s, conclusion or final adjustment and settlement of some matter, from verbal phrase wind up (see
wind (v.1)). Baseball pitching sense attested from 1906.


pitch (v.1)

c.1200, to thrust in, fasten, settle, probably from an unrecorded Old English *piccean, related to
prick (v.). The original past tense was pight. Sense of set upright, as in pitch a tent (late 13c.),
is from notion of driving in the pegs. Meaning to incline forward and downward is from 1510s.
Meaning throw (a ball) evolved late 14c. from that of hit the mark. Musical sense is from 1670s. Of
ships, to plunge in the waves, 1620s. To pitch in work vigorously is from 1847, perhaps from farm
labor. Related: Pitched; pitching.


queer (v.)

to spoil, ruin, 1812, from queer (adj.). Related: Queered; queering. Earlier it meant to puzzle,
ridicule, cheat (1790). To queer the pitch (1846) is in reference to the patter of an itinerant
tradesman or showman (see pitch (n.1)).    These wanderers, and those who are still seen
occasionally in the back streets of the metropolis, are said to 'go a-pitching ;' the spot they
select for their performance is their 'pitch,' and any interruption of their feats, such as an
accident, or the interference of a policeman, is said to 'queer the pitch,'--in other words, to
spoil it. [Thomas Frost, Circus Life and Circus Celebrities, London, 1875]
