ceramic (adj.)

1850, keramic, from Greek keramikos, from keramos potter's clay, pottery, tiles, perhaps from a pre-
Hellenic word. Watkins suggests possible connection with Latin cremare to burn, but Klein's sources
are firmly against this. Spelling influenced by French c&#233;ramique (1806). Related: ceramist
(1855). Ceramics is attested from 1857.
