awl (n.)

Old English &aelig;l awl, piercer, from Proto-Germanic *&aelig;lo (cognates: Old Norse alr, Dutch
aal, Middle Low German al, Old High German &auml;la, German Ahle), of uncertain origin. Earliest
references are to piercing of the ears, though later it was associated with shoemakers. Through
misdivision, frequently written 15c.-17c. as nawl (for an awl; see N).
