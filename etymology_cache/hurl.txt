hurl (v.)

early 13c., hurlen, to run against (each other), come into collision, later throw forcibly (c.1300);
rush violently (late 14c.); perhaps related to Low German hurreln to throw, to dash, and East
Frisian hurreln to roar, to bluster. OED suggests all are from an imitative Germanic base *hurr
expressing rapid motion; see also hurry. The noun is attested from late 14c., originally rushing
water. For difference between hurl and hurtle (which apparently were confused since early Middle
English) see hurtle.
