1836, from Sanskrit nirvana-s extinction, disappearance (of the individual soul into the universal),
literally to blow out, a blowing out (not transitively, but as a fire ceases to draw; a literal
Latinization would be de-spiration), from nis-, nir- out + va- to blow (see <a
href=/index.php?term=wind&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>wind</a> (n.1)). Figurative
sense of perfect bliss is from 1895.
