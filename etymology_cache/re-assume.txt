December (n.)

c.1000, from Old French decembre, from Latin December, from decem ten (see ten); tenth month of the
old Roman calendar, which began with March.    The -ber in four Latin month names is probably from
-bris, an adjectival suffix. Tucker thinks that the first five months were named for their positions
in the agricultural cycle, and after the gathering in of the crops, the months were merely numbered.
<blockquote>  If the word contains an element related to mensis, we must assume a *decemo-membris
(from *-mensris). October must then be by analogy from a false division Sep-tem-ber &amp;c.;
Perhaps, however, from *de-cem(o)-mr-is, i.e. forming the tenth part or division, from *mer- ...,
while October = *octuo-mr-is. [T.G. Tucker, Etymological Dictionary of Latin]  </blockquote>
