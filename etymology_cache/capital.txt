hence capital, chief, first, from caput (genitive capitis) head (see capitulum). Meaning main,
principal, chief, dominant, most important is from early 15c. in English. Capital letter for an
upper case one is attested from late 14c. The modern informal sense of excellent, first-rate is
dated from 1762 in OED (as an exclamation of approval, OED's first example is 1875), perhaps from
earlier use of the word in reference to ships, first-rate, of the line, attested from 1650s.   <br

heafdes &thorn;olian to forfeit life. Capital punishment was in Blackstone (1765) and classical
Latin capitis poena. Capital gain is recorded from 1921. Capital goods is recorded from 1899.
