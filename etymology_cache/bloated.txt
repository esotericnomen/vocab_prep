bloated (adj.)

overgrown, 1660s, past participle adjective from bloat (v.). Figurative sense by 1711.


fogey (n.)

also fogy, an old, dull fellow, 1780, Scottish foggie, originally army pensioner or veteran, perhaps
connected to fogram (1775) old-fashioned person; or from fog in obsolete senses of moss or bloated

bloat (v.)

1670s, to cause to swell (earlier, in reference to cured fish, to cause to be soft, 1610s), from now
obsolete bloat (adj.), attested from c.1300 as soft, flabby, flexible, pliable, but by 17c. meaning
puffed up, swollen. Perhaps from a Scandinavian source akin to Old Norse blautr soaked, soft from
being cooked in liquid (compare Swedish bl&#246;t fisk soaked fish), possibly from Proto-Germanic
*blaut-, from PIE *bhleu- to swell, well up, overflow, an extension of root *bhel- (2) to blow,
inflate, swell (see bole).    Influenced by or combined with Old English blawan blow, puff.
Figurative use by 1711. Intransitive meaning to swell, to become swollen is from 1735. Related:
Bloated; bloating.
