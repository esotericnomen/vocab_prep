1700, thieves' cant, to act as a lookout, spy on, from Middle English tuten to peep, peer, probably
from a variant of Old English totian to stick out, peep, peer, from Proto-Germanic *tut- project
(cognates: Dutch tuit sprout, snout, Middle Dutch tute nipple, pap, Middle Low German tute horn,
funnel, Old Norse tota teat, toe of a shoe). The sense developed to look out for jobs, votes,
customers, etc., to try to get them (1731), then praise highly in an attempt to sell (1920).
