c.1300, nobility of rank or birth, from Old French genterise, variant of gentilise noble birth,
gentleness, from gentil (see <a href=/index.php?term=gentle&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>gentle</a>). Meaning noble persons is from 1520s. Earlier in both senses was
gentrice (c.1200 as nobility of character, late 14c. as noble persons). In Anglo-Irish, gentry was a
name for the fairies (1880), and gentle could mean enchanted (1823).
