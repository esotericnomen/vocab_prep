forum (n.)

mid-15c., place of assembly in ancient Rome, from Latin forum marketplace, open space, public place,
apparently akin to foris, foras out of doors, outside, from PIE root *dhwer- (see door). Sense of
assembly, place for public discussion first recorded 1680s.


forensic (adj.)

pertaining to or suitable for courts of law, 1650s, from Latin forensis of a forum, place of
assembly, from forum public place (see forum). Used in sense of pertaining to legal trials, as in
forensic medicine (1845). Related: Forensical (1580s).


rostrum (n.)

1540s, from Latin rostrum, name of the platform stand for public speakers in the Forum in ancient
Rome. It was decorated with the beaks of ships taken in the first naval victory of the Roman
republic, over Antium, in 338 B.C.E., and the word's older sense is end of a ship's prow, literally
beak, muzzle, snout, originally means of gnawing, instrument noun form of rodere to gnaw (see
rodent). Compare claustrum lock, bar, from claudere to shut.  Extended sense of any platform for
public speaking is first recorded 1766. Classical plural form is rostra.


forest (n.)

late 13c., extensive tree-covered district, especially one set aside for royal hunting and under the
protection of the king, from Old French forest forest, wood, woodland (Modern French for&ecirc;t),
probably ultimately from Late Latin/Medieval Latin forestem silvam the outside woods, a term from
the Capitularies of Charlemagne denoting the royal forest; perhaps via Old High German forst, from
Latin foris outside (see foreign), with a sense of beyond the park, the park being the main or
central fenced woodland.    Another theory traces it through Medieval Latin forestis, originally
forest preserve, game preserve, from Latin forum in legal sense court, judgment; in other words land
subject to a ban [Buck]. Replaced Old English wudu.
