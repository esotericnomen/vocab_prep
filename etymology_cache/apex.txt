apex (n.)

c.1600, from Latin apex summit, peak, tip, top, extreme end; probably related to apere to fasten,
fix, hence the tip of anything (one of the meanings in Latin was small rod at the top of the
flamen's cap), from PIE *ap- to take, reach. Proper plural is apices.


apical (adj.)

of or belonging to an apex, 1828, from Latin apicem, from apex (see apex) + -al (1).


tittle (n.)

late 14c., small stroke or point in writing (Wyclif, in Matt. v:18), translating Latin apex in Late
Latin sense of accent mark over a vowel, which itself translates Greek keraia (literally a little
horn), used by the Greek grammarians of the accents and diacritical points, in this case a Biblical
translation of Hebrew qots, literally thorn, prick, used of the little lines and projections by
which the Hebrew letters of similar form differ from one another.    Wyclif's word is borrowed from
a specialized sense of Latin titulus (see title (n.)), which was used in Medieval Latin (and in
Middle English and Old French) to indicate a stroke over an abridged word to indicate letters
missing (and compare Proven&ccedil;al titule the dot over -i-).    As apex was used by the Latin
grammarians for the accent or mark over a long vowel, titulus and apex became to some extent
synonymous; hence Wyclif's use of titil, titel to render L. apex [OED]    Compare tilde, which is
the Spanish form of the same word.
