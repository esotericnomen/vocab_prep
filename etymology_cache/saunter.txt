saunter (n.)

a leisurely stroll, 1828, from saunter (v.). Earlier it meant idle occupation, diversion (1728).


saunter (v.)

late 15c., santren to muse, be in reverie, of uncertain origin despite many absurd speculations.
Meaning walk with a leisurely gait is from 1660s, and may be a different word. Klein suggests this
sense of the word derives via Anglo-French sauntrer (mid-14c.) from French s'aventurer to take
risks, but OED finds this unlikely. Related: Sauntered; sauntering.


flaneur (n.)

loafer, idler, 1854, from French fl&acirc;neur, from fl&acirc;ner to stroll, loaf, saunter, probably
from a Scandinavian source (compare Norwegian flana, flanta to gad about).
