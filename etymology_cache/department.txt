<blockquote>  The Department Store is the outgrowth of the cheap counter business originated by
Butler Brothers in Boston about ten years ago. The little Five Cent Counter then became a
cornerstone from which the largest of all the world's branches of merchandising was to be reared. It
was the Cheap Counter which proved to the progressive merchant his ability to sell all lines of
wares under one roof. It was the Five Cent Counter epidemic of '77 and '78 which rushed like a
mighty whirlwind from the Atlantic to the Pacific and all along its path transformed old time one
line storekeepers into the wide-awake merchant princes of the present day. It was this same epidemic
which made possible the world famed Department Stores of Houghton, of Boston; Macy, of New York;
Wanamaker, of Philadelphia; and Lehman, of Chicago. [American Storekeeper, 1885]  </blockquote>
