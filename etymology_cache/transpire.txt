1590s, pass off in the form of a vapor or liquid, from Middle French transpirer (16c.), from Latin
trans- through (see <a href=/index.php?term=trans-&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>trans-</a>) + spirare to breathe (see <a
href=/index.php?term=spirit&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>spirit</a> (n.)). Figurative
sense of leak out, become known is recorded from 1741, and the erroneous meaning take place, happen
is almost as old, being first recorded 1755. Related: Transpired; transpiring.
