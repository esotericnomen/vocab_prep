chagrin (v.)

1660s (implied in chagrined), from chagrin (n.). Related: Chagrined; chagrining.


chagrin (n.)

1650s, melancholy, from French chagrin melancholy, anxiety, vexation (14c.), from Old North French
chagreiner or Angevin dialect chagraigner sadden, of unknown origin, perhaps [Gamillscheg] from Old
French graignier grieve over, be angry, from graigne sadness, resentment, grief, vexation, from
graim sorrowful, of unknown origin, perhaps from a Germanic source (compare Old High German gram
angry, fierce). But OED and other sources trace it to an identical Old French word, borrowed into
English phonetically as shagreen, meaning rough skin or hide, of uncertain origin, the connecting
notion being roughness, harshness. Modern sense of feeling of irritation from disappointment is
1716.


neo-conservative (n.)

also neoconservative; used in the modern sense by 1979:    My Republican vote [in the 1972
presidential election] produced little shock waves in the New York intellectual community. It didn't
take long - a year or two - for the socialist writer Michael Harrington to come up with the term
neoconservative to describe a renegade liberal like myself. To the chagrin of some of my friends, I
decided to accept that term; there was no point calling myself a liberal when no one else did.
[Irving Kristol, Forty Good Years, The Public Interest, Spring 2005]    The term is attested from
1960, but it originally often was applied to Russell Kirk and his followers, who would be
philosophically opposed to the later neocons. From neo- + conservative.
