urchin (n.)

c.1300, yrichon hedgehog, from Old North French *irechon (cognates: Picard irechon, Walloon ireson,
Hainaut hirchon), from Old French herichun hedgehog (Modern French h&eacute;risson), formed with
diminutive suffix -on + Vulgar Latin *hericionem, from Latin ericius hedgehog, enlarged form of er,
originally *her, from PIE root *ghers- to bristle (cognates: Greek kheros hedgehog; see horror).
Still used for hedgehog in non-standard speech in Cumbria, Yorkshire, Shropshire. Applied throughout
16c. to people whose appearance or behavior suggested hedgehogs, from hunchbacks (1520s) to goblins
(1580s) to bad girls (1530s); meaning poorly or raggedly clothed youngster emerged 1550s, but was
not in frequent use until after c.1780. Sea urchin is recorded from 1590s (a 19c. Newfoundland name
for them was whore's eggs); Johnson describes it as a kind of crabfish that has prickles instead of
feet.
