late 14c., from Latin temeritatem (nominative temeritas) blind chance, accident; rashness,
indiscretion, foolhardiness, from temere by chance, at random; indiscreetly, rashly, related to
tenebrae darkness, from PIE root *teme- dark (cognates: Sanskrit tamas- darkness, tamsrah dark;
Avestan temah darkness; Lithuanian tamsa darkness, tamsus dark; Old Church Slavonic tima darkness;
Old High German dinstar dark; Old Irish temel darkness). The connecting notion is blindly, without
foreseeing.
