onerous (adj.)

late 14c., from Old French onereus, honereus (14c., Modern French on&eacute;reux) and directly from
Latin onerosus, from onus (genitive oneris) burden (see onus).


Occam&#039;s razor

when two competing hypotheses explain the data equally well, choose the simpler. Or, as Sir William
Hamilton puts it, Neither more, nor more onerous, causes are to be assumed, than are necessary to
account for the phenomena. Named for English philosopher William of Ockham or Occam (c.1285-c.1349),
who expressed it with Entia non sunt multiplicanda praeter ncccssitatem.    So called after William
of Occam (died about 1349): but, as a historical fact, Occam does not make much use of this
principle, which belongs rather to the contemporary nominalist William Durand de St. Pour&#231;ain
(died 1332). [Century Dictionary]
