utopia (n.)

1551, from Modern Latin Utopia, literally nowhere, coined by Thomas More (and used as title of his
book, 1516, about an imaginary island enjoying the utmost perfection in legal, social, and political
systems), from Greek ou not + topos place (see topos). Extended to any perfect place by 1610s.
Commonly, but incorrectly, taken as from Greek eu- good (see eu-) an error reinforced by the
introduction of dystopia.


utopian (adj.)

1550s, with reference to More's fictional country; 1610s as extravagantly ideal, impossibly
visionary, from utopia + -an. As a noun meaning visionary idealist it is recorded by 1832 (also in
this sense was utopiast, 1845).


Shangri La (n.)

imaginary earthly paradise, 1938, from Shangri La, name of Tibetan utopia in James Hilton's novel
Lost Horizon (1933, film version 1937). In Tibetan, la means mountain pass.


dystopia (n.)

imaginary bad place, 1868, apparently coined by J.S. Mill (Hansard Commons), from Greek dys- bad,
abnormal, difficult (see dys-) + utopia. Related: Dystopian.


suburbia (n.)

1876, from suburb + -ia, perhaps on the model of utopia.
