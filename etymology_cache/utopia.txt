utopia (n.)

1551, from Modern Latin Utopia, literally nowhere, coined by Thomas More (and used as title of his
book, 1516, about an imaginary island enjoying the utmost perfection in legal, social, and political
systems), from Greek ou not + topos place (see topos). Extended to any perfect place by 1610s.
Commonly, but incorrectly, taken as from Greek eu- good (see eu-) an error reinforced by the
introduction of dystopia.
