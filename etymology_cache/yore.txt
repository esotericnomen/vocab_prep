yore (adv.)

Old English geara of yore, formerly, in former times, literally of years, originally adverbial
genitive plural of gear (see year), and used without of. As a noun from mid-14c.


auntie (n.)

1787, also aunty, familiar diminutive form of aunt. As a form of kindly address to an older woman to
whom one is not related, originally in southern U.S., of elderly slave women.  The negro no longer
submits with grace to be called uncle or auntie as of yore. [Harper's Magazine, October 1883]


Wyoming

region in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, from Munsee Delaware (Algonquian) chwewamink at the big
river flat, from /xw-/ big + /-e:wam-/ river flat + /-enk/ place. Popularized by 1809 poem Gertrude
of Wyoming, set amid wars between Indians and American settlers, written by Scottish author Thomas
Campbell (1777-1844), who seems to have had a vague or defective notion of Pennsylvania geography:
On Susquehanna's side, fair Wyoming!  Although the wild-flower on thy ruin'd wall,  And roofless
homes, a sad remembrance bring,  Of what thy gentle people did befall;  Yet thou wert once the
loveliest land of all  That see the Atlantic wave their morn restore.  Sweet land! may I thy lost
delights recall,  And paint thy Gertrude in her bowers of yore,  Whose beauty was the love of
Pennsylvania's shore!   et cetera. Subsequently applied 19c. to other locations (in Kansas, Ohio,
and Wisconsin), and to a western territory organized July 25, 1868 (admitted as a state 1890).    On
the same day there was debate in the Senate over the name for the new Territory. Territories often
keep their names when they become States, so we may be glad that Cheyenne, to be pronounced Shy-en,
was not adopted. Lincoln was rejected for an obvious and, no doubt, sound reason. Apparently, nobody
had a better name to offer, though there must be plenty of Indian words that could properly be used,
and, for the present, the insignificant Wyoming is retained. [The Nation, June 11, 1868]
