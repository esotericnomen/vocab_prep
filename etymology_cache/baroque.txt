baroque (adj.)

1765, from French baroque (15c.) irregular, from Portuguese barroco imperfect pearl, of uncertain
origin, perhaps related to Spanish berruca a wart.<blockquote>This style in decorations got the
epithet of Barroque taste, derived from a word signifying pearls and teeth of unequal size.
[Fuseli's translation of Winkelmann, 1765]</blockquote>Klein suggests the name may be from Italian
painter Federigo Barocci (1528-1612), a founder of the style. How to tell baroque from rococo,
according to Fowler: The characteristics of baroque are grandeur, pomposity, and weight; those of
rococo are inconsequence, grace, and lightness. But the two terms often used without distinction for
styles featuring odd and excessive ornamentation.
