baroque (adj.)

1765, from French baroque (15c.) irregular, from Portuguese barroco imperfect pearl, of uncertain
origin, perhaps related to Spanish berruca a wart.This style in decorations got the epithet of
Barroque taste, derived from a word signifying pearls and teeth of unequal size. [Fuseli's
translation of Winkelmann, 1765]Klein suggests the name may be from Italian painter Federigo Barocci
(1528-1612), a founder of the style. How to tell baroque from rococo, according to Fowler: The
characteristics of baroque are grandeur, pomposity, and weight; those of rococo are inconsequence,
grace, and lightness. But the two terms often used without distinction for styles featuring odd and
excessive ornamentation.


rococo (adj.)

1836, old-fashioned, from French rococo (19c.), apparently a humorous alteration of rocaille
shellwork, pebble-work from Middle French roche rock, from Vulgar Latin *rocca stone. Specifically
of furniture or architecture of the time of Louis Quatorze and Louis Quinze, from 1841. If this is
correct, the reference is to the excessive use of shell designs in this lavish style. For
differentiation, see baroque. The general sense of tastelessly florid or ornate is from 1844.
Much of the painting, engraving, porcelain-work, etc., of the time has ... a real decorative charm,
though not of a very high order in art. Hence rococo is used attributively in contempt to note
anything feebly pretentious and tasteless in art or literature. [Century Dictionary, 1902]
