sporadic (adj.)

1680s, from Medieval Latin sporadicus scattered, from Greek sporadikos scattered, from sporas
(genitive sporados) scattered, dispersed, from spora a sowing (see spore). Originally a medical
term, occurring in scattered instances; the meaning happening at intervals is first recorded 1847.
Related: Sporadical (1650s); sporadically.


rock (n.1)

stone, mass of mineral matter, c.1300, from Old English rocc (as in stanrocc stone rock or obelisk)
and directly from Old North French roque, which is cognate with Medieval Latin rocca (8c.), from
Vulgar Latin *rocca, of uncertain origin, according to Klein sometimes said to be from Celtic
(compare Breton roch).    In Middle English it seems to have been used principally for rock
formations as opposed to individual stones. Meaning precious stone, especially a diamond, is 1908,
U.S. slang. Meaning crystallized cocaine is attested from 1973, in West Coast U.S. slang. Figurative
use for sure foundation (especially with reference to Christ) is from 1520s; but also from 1520s as
source of danger or destruction, in reference to shipwrecks (as in on the rocks). Also used
attributively in names of animals that frequent rocky habitats, as in rock lobster (1843). Between a
rock and a hard place first attested 1921:   to be between a rock and a hard place, vb. ph. To be
bankrupt. Common in Arizona in recent panics; sporadic in California. [Dialect Notes, vol. V, part
iv, 1921]    Rock-ribbed is from 1776, originally of land; figurative sense of resolute first
recorded 1887. Rock-happy (1945) was U.S. Pacific Theater armed forces slang for mentally unhinged
after too much time on one island. The rock-scissors-paper game is attested by that name from 1976;
from 1968 as paper-stone-scissors. A 1967 source says it is based on Japanese Jan Ken Pon (or Janken
for short), which is said to mean the same thing more or less.
