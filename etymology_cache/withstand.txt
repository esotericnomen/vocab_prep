Old English wi&eth;standan resist, oppose, from wi&eth; against (see <a
href=/index.php?term=with&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>with</a>) + standan to stand
(see <a href=/index.php?term=stand&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>stand</a> (v.));
perhaps a loan-translation of Latin resistere to resist (see <a
href=/index.php?term=resist&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>resist</a>). Similar
formation in Old Norse vi&eth;standa, Old Frisian withstonda, Old High German widarstan, German
widerstehen. In 14c. and early 15c., withsit was in use with the same meaning. Related: Withstood;
withstanding.
