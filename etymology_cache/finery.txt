finery (n.)

1670s, showy dress, from fine (adj.) + -ery. Literally, something that is fine.


trumpery (n.)

mid-15c., deceit, trickery, from Middle French tromperie (14c.), from tromper to deceive, of
uncertain origin (see trump (v.2), which has influenced the spelling in English). Meaning showy but
worthless finery is first recorded c.1600.


chiffon (n.)

feminine finery, sheer silk fabric, 1765, from French chiffon (17c.), diminutive of chiffe a rag,
piece of cloth (17c.), of unknown origin, perhaps a variant of English chip (n.1) or one of its
Germanic cousins. Klein suggests Arabic. Extension to pastry is attested by 1929.


putz (n.)

obnoxious man, fool, 1964, from Yiddish, from German putz, literally finery, adornment, obviously
used here in an ironic sense. Attested in writing earlier in slang sense of penis (1934, in Tropic
of Cancer). A non-ironic sense is in putz Nativity display around a Christmas tree (1873), from
Pennsylvania Dutch (German), which retains the old German sense.


attire (v.)

c.1300, to fit out, equip; to dress in finery, to adorn, from Old French atirier to equip, ready,
prepare, from a- to + tire order, row, dress (see tier). Related: Attired; attiring.


frippery (n.)

1560s, old clothes, cast-off garments, from Middle French friperie old clothes, an old clothes shop,
from Old French freperie, feuperie old rags, rubbish (13c.), from frepe, feupe fringe; rags, old
clothes, from Late Latin faluppa chip, splinter, straw, fiber. The notion is of things worn down,
clothes rubbed to rags. The ironic meaning finery (but with overtones of tawdriness) dates from
1630s.


gala (n.)

1620s, festive dress or attire, from French en gala, perhaps from Old French gale merriment, from
galer rejoice, make merry (see gallant). Klein suggests the French word is from Italian gala (as in
phrase vestito di gala robe of state), perhaps from Arabic khil'a fine garment given as a
presentation. Sense of festive occasion (characterized by display of finery) first recorded 1777.
