c.1400, perhaps a causative or frequentative form of Middle English suken to suck (see <a
href=/index.php?term=suck&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>suck</a>), but OED suggests
instead a back-formation from <a href=/index.php?term=suckling&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>suckling</a> (though this word is attested only from mid-15c.). Related:
Suckled; suckling.
