hoary (adj.)

1510s, gray or white with age (of hair); c.1600 as venerable, ancient; from hoar + -y (2). Related:
Hoariness.


Herr

German equivalent of Mr., 1650s, originally nobler, superior, from Middle High German herre, from
Old High German herro, comparative of her noble, worthy, exalted, from PIE *kei-, a color adjective,
in suffixed form *koi-ro- here meaning gray, hoary, hence gray-haired, venerable. Cognate with Old
Frisian hera, Dutch heer; perhaps in this usage a loan-translation of Latin senior. Hence also
Herrenvolk master race, in Nazi ideology, the concept of the German people.


hoar (adj.)

Old English har hoary, gray, venerable, old, the connecting notion being gray hair, from Proto-
Germanic *haira (cognates: Old Norse harr gray-haired, old, Old Saxon, Old High German her
distinguished, noble, glorious, German hehr), from PIE *kei-, source of color adjectives (see hue
(n.1)). German also uses the word as a title of respect, in Herr. Of frost, it is recorded in Old
English, perhaps expressing the resemblance of the white feathers of frost to an old man's beard.
Used as an attribute of boundary stones in Anglo-Saxon, perhaps in reference to being gray with
lichens, hence its appearance in place-names.
