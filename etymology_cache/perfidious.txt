Albion

ancient name of England, Old English, from Latin, sometimes said to be from the non-Indo-European
base *alb mountain, which also is suggested as the source of Latin Alpes Alps, Albania, and Alba, an
Irish name for Scotland. But more likely from Latin albus white (see alb), which would be an apt
description of the chalk cliffs of the island's southern coast.Breoton is garsecges ealond,
&eth;&aelig;t w&aelig;s iu geara Albion haten. [translation of Bede's Historia Ecclesiastica Gentis
Anglorum, c.900 C.E.]Perfidious Albion translates French rhetorical phrase la perfide Albion, said
to have been in use since 16c. but popularized by Napoleon I in the recruiting drive of 1813, a
reference to the supposedly treacherous policies of Britain when dealing with foreign powers.
