weatherman (n.)

one who observes the weather, 1869, from weather (n.) + man (n.). Weather-prophet is from 1784 as
barometer; 1827 as person who predicts the weather.  <blockquote>  Clerk of the Weather, I deplore
That all thy greatness is no more,  As should a gentle bard;  That Nature, or that Nature's law
When you politely called for thaw,  Gave frost was rather hard.  [from Consolatory Address to Mr.
Murphy, the Weather Prophet, Colburn's New Monthly Magazine, 1838]  </blockquote>
