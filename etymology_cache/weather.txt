predicts the weather.  <blockquote>  Clerk of the Weather, I deplore  <br />That all thy greatness
is no more,  <br />As should a gentle bard;  <br />That Nature, or that Nature's law  <br />When you
politely called for thaw,  <br />Gave frost was rather hard.  <br /><br />[from Consolatory Address
to Mr. Murphy, the Weather Prophet, Colburn's New Monthly Magazine, 1838]  </blockquote>
