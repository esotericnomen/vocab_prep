right of succession of the first-born, c.1600, from French primogeniture and directly from Medieval
Latin primogenitura, from Late Latin primogenitus first-born, from Latin primo (adv.) first in order
of time, from primus first (see <a href=/index.php?term=prime&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>prime</a> (adj.)) + genitus, past participle of gignere to beget (see <a
href=/index.php?term=genus&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>genus</a>). Earlier it meant
simply fact of being first-born (1590s).
