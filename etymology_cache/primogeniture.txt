primogeniture (n.)

right of succession of the first-born, c.1600, from French primogeniture and directly from Medieval
Latin primogenitura, from Late Latin primogenitus first-born, from Latin primo (adv.) first in order
of time, from primus first (see prime (adj.)) + genitus, past participle of gignere to beget (see
genus). Earlier it meant simply fact of being first-born (1590s).
