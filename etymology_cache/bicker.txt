c.1300, skirmish, battle; from the same source as <a
href=/index.php?term=bicker&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>bicker</a> (v.). In modern
use, often to describe the sound of a flight of an arrow or other repeated, loud, rapid sounds, in
which sense it is perhaps at least partly echoic.
