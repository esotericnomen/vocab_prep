biennial (adj.)

lasting for two years (1620s); occurring every two years (1750), from Latin biennium two-year
period, from bi- (see bi-) + annus year (see annual). The vowel change is due to the Latin phonetic
law according to which the unaccented and closed radical syllable of the second element of
compounds, original -&#259;- becomes -&#277;- [Klein]. The noun meaning a biennial plant is attested
by 1770.
