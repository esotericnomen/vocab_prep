lasting for two years (1620s); occurring every two years (1750), from Latin biennium two-year
period, from bi- (see <a href=/index.php?term=bi-&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>bi-</a>) + annus year (see <a
href=/index.php?term=annual&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>annual</a>). The vowel
change is due to the Latin phonetic law according to which the unaccented and closed radical
syllable of the second element of compounds, original -&#259;- becomes -&#277;- [Klein]. The noun
meaning a biennial plant is attested by 1770.
