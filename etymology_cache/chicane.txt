chicane (n.)

in English in various senses, including act of chicanery (1670s), obstacles on a roadway (1955),
also a term in bridge (1880s), apparently all ultimately from an archaic verb chicane to trick
(1670s), from French chicane (16c.), from chicaner to pettifog, quibble (15c., see chicanery).
