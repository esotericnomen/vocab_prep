calamity (n.)

early 15c., from Middle French calamite (14c.), from Latin calamitatem (nominative calamitas)
damage, loss, failure; disaster, misfortune, adversity, origin obscure. Early etymologists
associated it with calamus straw (see shawm); but it is perhaps from a lost root preserved in
incolumis uninjured, from PIE *kle-mo-, from base *kel- (1) to strike, cut (see holt).
