early 15c., from Middle French calamite (14c.), from Latin calamitatem (nominative calamitas)
damage, loss, failure; disaster, misfortune, adversity, origin obscure. Early etymologists
associated it with calamus straw (see <a href=/index.php?term=shawm&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>shawm</a>); but it is perhaps from a lost root preserved in incolumis
uninjured, from PIE *kle-mo-, from base *kel- (1) to strike, cut (see <a
href=/index.php?term=holt&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>holt</a>).
