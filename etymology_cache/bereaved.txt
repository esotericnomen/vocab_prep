Old English bereafian to deprive of, take away, seize, rob, from be + reafian rob, plunder, from
Proto-Germanic *raubojanan, from PIE *reup- to snatch (see <a
href=/index.php?term=rapid&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>rapid</a>). A common Germanic
formation (compare Old Frisian birava despoil, Old Saxon biroban, Dutch berooven, Old High German
biroubon, German berauben, Gothic biraubon). Since mid-17c., mostly in reference to life, hope,
loved ones, and other immaterial possessions. Past tense forms bereaved and <a
href=/index.php?term=bereft&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>bereft</a> have co-existed
since 14c., now slightly differentiated in meaning, the former applied to loss of loved ones, the
latter to circumstances.
