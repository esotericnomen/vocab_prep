mite (n.2)

little bit, mid-14c., from Middle Dutch or Middle Low German mite tiny animal, from Proto-Germanic
*miton-, from PIE *mei- (2) small (see minus), and thus probably identical with mite (n.1). Also the
name of a medieval Flemish copper coin of very small value, proverbial in English for a very small
unit of money, hence used since Wyclif to translate Latin minutum from Vulgate in Mark xii:43,
itself a translation of Greek lepton. French mite (14c.) is a loan-word from Dutch.
