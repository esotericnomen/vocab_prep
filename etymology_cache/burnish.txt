burnish (v.)

early 14c., from Old French burniss- present participle stem of burnir, metathesis of brunir to
shine, gleam, sparkle (trans.), to polish, make sparkle, make bright, shine, from brun brown;
polished, from a Germanic source (compare Old High German brun, Old Norse brunn bright, polished;
brown; see brown (adj.)). The connection to brown might be explained if the original objects in mind
were wooden ones. Related: Burnished; burnishing.
