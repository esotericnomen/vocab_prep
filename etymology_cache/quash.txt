quash (v.)

to make void, annul, early 14c., from Old French quasser, casser to annul, declare void, and
directly from Medieval Latin quassare, alteration of Late Latin cassare, from cassus null, void,
empty (see caste (n.)).    Meaning to break, crush, is early 14c., from Old French quasser, casser
to break, smash, injure, harm, weaken, from Latin quassare to shatter, frequentative of quatere
(past participle quassus) to shake, from PIE root *kwet- to shake (cognates: Greek passein to
sprinkle, Lithuanian kuteti to shake up, Old Saxon skuddian to move violently, German sch&#252;tteln
to shake, Old English scudan to hasten).    The words have influenced each other in form and sense
since Medieval Latin and now are somewhat grown together. Related: Quashed; quashing.
