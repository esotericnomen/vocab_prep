loom (v.)

1540s, to come into view largely and indistinctly, perhaps from a Scandinavian source (compare
dialectal Swedish loma, East Frisian lomen move slowly), perhaps a variant from the root of lame
(adj.). Early used also of ships moving up and down. Figurative use from 1590s. Related: Loomed;
looming.
