ostracism (n.)

1580s, a method of 10-year banishment in ancient Athens, by which the citizens gathered and each
wrote on a potsherd or tile the name of a man they deemed dangerous to the liberties of the people,
and a man whose name turned up often enough was sent away. From Middle French ostracisme (16c.),
Modern Latin ostracismus, or directly from Greek ostrakismos, from ostrakizein to ostracize, from
ostrakon tile, potsherd, from PIE *ost-r-, from root *ost- bone (see osseous). The Greek word is
related to osteon bone, ostreion oyster (and cognate with German Estrich pavement, which is from
Medieval Latin astracus pavement, ultimately from Greek ostrakon).    A similar practice in ancient
Syracuse (with banishment for five years) was by writing names on olive leaves, and thus was called
petalismos.
