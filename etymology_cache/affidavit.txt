1590s, from Medieval Latin affidavit, literally he has stated on oath, third person singular
perfective of affidare to trust, from Latin ad- to (see <a
href=/index.php?term=ad-&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>ad-</a>) + fidare to trust,
from fidus faithful, from fides faith (see <a href=/index.php?term=faith&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>faith</a>). So called from being the first word of sworn statements.
