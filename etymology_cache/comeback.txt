metaphysics (n.)

1560s, plural of Middle English metaphisik, methaphesik (late 14c.), branch of speculation which
deals with the first causes of things, from Medieval Latin metaphysica, neuter plural of Medieval
Greek (ta) metaphysika, from Greek ta meta ta physika the (works) after the Physics, title of the 13
treatises which traditionally were arranged after those on physics and natural sciences in
Aristotle's writings. The name was given c.70 B.C.E. by Andronicus of Rhodes, and was a reference to
the customary ordering of the books, but it was misinterpreted by Latin writers as meaning the
science of what is beyond the physical. See meta- + physics. The word originally was used in English
in the singular; plural form predominated after 17c., but singular made a comeback late 19c. in
certain usages under German influence.
