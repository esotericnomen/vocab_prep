drab (n.)

1680s, color of natural, undyed cloth, from Middle French drap (see drape (n.)). Figurative sense is
c.1880. Apparently not related to earlier word meaning a dirty, untidy woman (1510s), a prostitute
(1520s), which seems to be connected with Irish drabog, Gaelic drabag dirty woman, and perhaps with
Low German drabbe dirt. Ultimately perhaps from PIE *dher- (1) to make muddy. Meaning small, petty
debt (the sense in dribs and drabs) is 1828, of uncertain connection to the other senses.


drivel (v.)

Old English dreflian to dribble or run at the nose, slobber, from Proto-Germanic *drab-, from PIE
*dher- (1) to make muddy, darken. Meaning to speak nonsense is mid-14c. Related: Driveling,
drivelling.


trull (n.)

a low prostitute or concubine; a drab, strumpet, trollop [OED], 1510s, from German trulle trollop,
wench, hussy, perhaps cognate with troll (n.), or perhaps from troll (v.), compare Middle High
German trolle awkward fellow, Swabian trull a thick, fat woman.


pucelle (n.)

maid, mid-15c., especially in reference to Joan of Arc (called in Old French la pucelle from
c.1423), according to French sources from Vulgar Latin *pulicella maid (source also of Italian
pulcella), diminutive of Latin pulla, fem. of pullus young animal, especially a chicken (see foal
(n.)), but there are difficulties with this derivation. Also, in 16c. English, a drab, a slut.
