1680s, color of natural, undyed cloth, from Middle French drap (see <a
href=/index.php?term=drape&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>drape</a> (n.)). Figurative
sense is c.1880. Apparently not related to earlier word meaning a dirty, untidy woman (1510s), a
prostitute (1520s), which seems to be connected with Irish drabog, Gaelic drabag dirty woman, and
perhaps with Low German drabbe dirt. Ultimately perhaps from PIE *dher- (1) to make muddy. Meaning
small, petty debt (the sense in dribs and drabs) is 1828, of uncertain connection to the other
senses.
