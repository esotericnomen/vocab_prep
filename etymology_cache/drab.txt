drab (n.)

1680s, color of natural, undyed cloth, from Middle French drap (see drape (n.)). Figurative sense is
c.1880. Apparently not related to earlier word meaning a dirty, untidy woman (1510s), a prostitute
(1520s), which seems to be connected with Irish drabog, Gaelic drabag dirty woman, and perhaps with
Low German drabbe dirt. Ultimately perhaps from PIE *dher- (1) to make muddy. Meaning small, petty
debt (the sense in dribs and drabs) is 1828, of uncertain connection to the other senses.
