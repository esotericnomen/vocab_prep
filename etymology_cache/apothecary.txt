mid-14c., shopkeeper, especially one who stores, compounds, and sells medicaments, from Old French
apotecaire (13c., Modern French apothicaire), from Late Latin apothecarius storekeeper, from Latin
apotheca storehouse, from Greek apotheke barn, storehouse, literally a place where things are put
away, from apo- away (see <a href=/index.php?term=apo-&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>apo-</a>) + tithenai to put, to place (see <a
href=/index.php?term=theme&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>theme</a>). Same root
produced French boutique and Spanish bodega. Cognate compounds produced Sanskrit apadha-
concealment, Old Persian apadana- palace.  <br /><br />  Drugs and herbs being among the chief items
of non-perishable goods, the meaning narrowed 17c. to druggist (Apothecaries' Company of London
separated from the Grocers' in 1617). Apothecaries formerly were notorious for the assumed gravity
and affectation of knowledge generally put on by the gentlemen of this profession, who are commonly
as superficial in their learning as they are pedantic in their language [Francis Grose, A Classical
Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue, 1796]. Hence, Apothecary's Latin, barbarously mangled, also known
as Dog Latin.
