Old English mist dimness (of eyesight), mist (earliest in compounds, such as misthleo&eth;u misty
cliffs, w&aelig;lmist mist of death), from Proto-Germanic *mikhstaz (cognates: Middle Low German
mist, Dutch mist, Icelandic mistur, Norwegian and Swedish mist), perhaps from PIE *meigh- to urinate
(cognates: Greek omikhle, Old Church Slavonic migla, Sanskrit mih, megha cloud, mist; see <a

class=crossreference>micturition</a>).<blockquote>Sometimes distinguished from fog, either as being
less opaque or as consisting of drops large enough to have a perceptible downward motion.
[OED]</blockquote>Also in Old English in sense of dimness of the eyes, either by illness or tears,
and in figurative sense of things that obscure mental vision.
