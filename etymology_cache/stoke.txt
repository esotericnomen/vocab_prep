1680s, to feed and stir up a fire in a fireplace or furnace, back-formation from stoker (1650s);
ultimately from Dutch stoken to stoke, from Middle Dutch stoken to poke, thrust, related to stoc
stick, stump, from Proto-Germanic *stok- pierce, prick, from PIE *steug-, extended form of root
*(s)teu- (1) to push, stick, knock, beat (see stick (v.)).    Meaning to stir up, rouse (feelings,
