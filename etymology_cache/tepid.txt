tepid (adj.)

c.1400, from Latin tepidus lukewarm, from tepere be moderately warm, from PIE root *tep- to be hot
(cognates: Sanskrit tapati makes warm, heats, burns, tapas heat, austerity; Avestan tafnush fever;
Old Church Slavonic topiti to warm, teplu warm; Old Irish tene fire; Welsh tes heat). Related:

luke (adj.)

obsolete except in lukewarm (late 14c.), from Middle English leuk tepid (c.1200), of unknown origin;
perhaps from Middle Dutch or Old Frisian leuk tepid, weak, or from Old English hleowe (adv.) warm,
all from Proto-Germanic *khlewaz (see lee).


lee (n.)

Old English hleo shelter, cover, defense, protection, from Proto-Germanic *khlewaz (cognates: Old
Norse hle, Danish l&aelig;, Old Saxon hleo, Dutch lij lee, shelter). No known cognates outside
Germanic; original sense uncertain and might have been warm (compare German lau tepid, Old Norse hly
shelter, warmth), which might link it to PIE *kele- (1) warm. As an adjective, 1510s, from the noun.
