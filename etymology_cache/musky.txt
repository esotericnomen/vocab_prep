musky (n.)

late 19c., short for muskrat or muskellunge. Also   muskie.


musky (adj.)

c.1600, from musk + -y (2). Related: Muskiness.


muscat (n.)

type of wine, 1570s, from French, from Italian moscato, literally musky-flavored, from Vulgar Latin
*muscatus, from Latin muscus (see musk).


weasel (n.)

Old English weosule, wesle weasel, from Proto-Germanic *wisulon (cognates: Old Norse visla, Middle
Dutch wesel, Dutch wezel, Old High German wisula, German Wiesel), probably related to Proto-Germanic
*wisand- bison (see bison), with a base sense of stinking animal, because both animals have a foul,
musky smell (compare Latin vissio stench). A John Wesilheued (John Weaselhead) turns up on the
Lincolnshire Assize Rolls for 1384, but the name seems not to have endured, for some reason.
Related: Weaselly.


nutmeg (n.)

hard aromatic seed of the East Indies, c.1300, from Old North French or Anglo-French *noiz mugue,
from Old French nois muguete, unexplained alteration of nois muscade nut smelling like musk, from
nois nut (from Latin nux) + Latin muscada, fem. of muscat musky (see muscat). Probably influenced in
English by Medieval Latin nux maga (compare unaltered Dutch muskaatnoot, German muscatnu&szlig;,
Swedish muskotn&ouml;t).    American English colloquial wooden nutmeg anything false or fraudulent
is from 1830. Connecticut is called the Nutmeg State in allusion to the story that wooden nutmegs
are there manufactured for exportation. [John Russell Bartlett, Dictionary of Americanisms, 1859]
