stupefy (v.)

early 15c., from Latin stupefacere make stupid or senseless, benumb, stun, from stupere be stunned
(see stupid) + facere to make (see factitious).


stupefaction (n.)

early 15c., from Medieval Latin stupefactionem (nominative stupefactio), noun of action from past
participle stem of Latin stupefacere (see stupefy).


amaze (v.)

early 13c., amasian stupefy, make crazy, from a-, probably used here as an intensive prefix, +
-masian, related to maze (q.v.). Sense of overwhelm with wonder is from 1580s. Related: Amazed;
amazing.


maze (n.)

c.1300, delusion, bewilderment (also as a verb, stupefy, daze), possibly from Old English
*m&aelig;s, which is suggested by the compound amasod amazed and verb amasian to confound, confuse
(see amaze). Perhaps related to Norwegian dialectal mas exhausting labor, Swedish masa to be slow or
sluggish. Meaning labyrinth first recorded late 14c.


sturdy (adj.)

c.1300, hard to manage, reckless, violent, from Old French estordi (11c., Modern French
&#233;tourdi) violent, originally dazed, past participle of estordiir to daze, stun, stupefy, from
Vulgar Latin *exturdire, which some presume to be from Latin intensive prefix ex- + turdus thrush.
Barnhart suggests the notion is of thrushes eating grape remnants at wineries and behaving as if
drunk (Italian tordo thrush also means simpleton, and French has the expression so&#251;l comme une
grive drunk as a thrush). OED, however, regards all this as open to grave objection. Century
Dictionary compares Latin torpidus dull.    Sense of solidly built, strong and hardy first recorded
late 14c. Related: Sturdily; sturdiness. Sturdy-boots obstinate person is from 1762; a sturdy beggar
in old language was one capable of work (c.1400).
