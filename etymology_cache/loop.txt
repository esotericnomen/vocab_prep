Looped; looping. Slang looped drunk is from 1934. Loop the loop (1900) originally was in reference
to roller-coasters at amusement parks.  <blockquote>  Loop-the-Loop is the name of a new
entertainment which goes further in the way of tempting Providence than anything yet invented. The
Loop is an immense circle of track in the air. A car on a mimic railway shoots down a very steep
incline, and is impelled around the inner side of this loop. ... The authorities at Coney Island are
said to have prohibited looping-the-loop because women break their corset strings in their efforts
to catch their breath as they sweep down the incline, and moreover, a young man is reported to have
ruptured a blood vessel in his liver. [Philadelphia Medical Journal, Aug. 10, 1901]  </blockquote>
