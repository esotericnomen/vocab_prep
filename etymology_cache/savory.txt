savory (n.)

aromatic mint, late 14c., perhaps an alteration of Old English s&aelig;&thorn;erie, which is
ultimately from Latin satureia savory (n.), a foreign word in Latin. But early history of the word
suggests transmission via Old French savereie. In either case, the form of the word probably was
altered by influence of the Middle English or Old French form of savory (adj.).
