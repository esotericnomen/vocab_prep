savory (n.)

aromatic mint, late 14c., perhaps an alteration of Old English s&aelig;&thorn;erie, which is
ultimately from Latin satureia savory (n.), a foreign word in Latin. But early history of the word
suggests transmission via Old French savereie. In either case, the form of the word probably was
altered by influence of the Middle English or Old French form of savory (adj.).


savory (adj.)

pleasing in taste or smell, c.1200, from Old French savore tasty, flavorsome (Modern French
savour&eacute;),  past participle of savourer to taste (see savor (n.)).

unsavory (adj.)

sapid (adj.)

souffle (n.)

light dish, sometimes savory but usually sweet, 1813, from French souffl&eacute;, noun use of past
participle of souffler to puff up, from Latin sufflare, from sub- under, up from under (see sub-) +
flare to blow (see blow (v.1)).


aspic (n.)

savory meat jelly, 1789, from French aspic jelly (18c.), literally asp, from Old French aspe (see
asp) + ending from basilisc basilisk (the two creatures sometimes were confused with one another).
The foodstuff said to be so called from its coldness (froid comme un aspic is said by Littr&eacute;
to be a proverbial phrase), or the colors in the gelatin, or the shape of the mold. It also was a
French word for lavendar spike and might refer to this as a seasoning element.
