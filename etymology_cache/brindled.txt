brindled (adj.)

marked with streaks, streaked with a dark color, 1670s, from Middle English brended (early 15c.),
from bren brown color (13c.), noun made from past participle of brennen burn (see burn (v.)); the
derived adjective perhaps means marked as though by branding or burning. Form altered perhaps by
influence of kindled.
