marked with streaks, streaked with a dark color, 1670s, from Middle English brended (early 15c.),
from bren brown color (13c.), noun made from past participle of brennen burn (see <a
href=/index.php?term=burn&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>burn</a> (v.)); the derived
adjective perhaps means marked as though by branding or burning. Form altered perhaps by influence
of kindled.
