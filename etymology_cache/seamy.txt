c.1600, least pleasant, worst, in figurative phrase seamy side, from <a
href=/index.php?term=seam&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>seam</a> + <a
href=/index.php?term=-y&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>-y</a> (2); the seamy side of a
sewn garment being the less attractive, and thus typically turned in. The popularity of the
figurative sense likely is due to its use by Shakespeare in Othello IV.ii.146: Some such Squire he
was That turn'd your wits the seamy-side without, And made you to suspect me with the Moore.
