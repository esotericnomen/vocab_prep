seamy (adj.)

c.1600, least pleasant, worst, in figurative phrase seamy side, from seam + -y (2); the seamy side
of a sewn garment being the less attractive, and thus typically turned in. The popularity of the
figurative sense likely is due to its use by Shakespeare in Othello IV.ii.146: Some such Squire he
was That turn'd your wits the seamy-side without, And made you to suspect me with the Moore.
