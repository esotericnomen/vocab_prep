chore (n.)

1751, American English, variant of char, from Middle English cherre odd job, from Old English cerr,
cierr turn, change, time, occasion, affair business.   Chore, a corruption of char, is an English
word, still used in many parts of England, as a char-man, a char-woman; but in America, it is
perhaps confined to New England. It signifies small domestic jobs of work, and its place cannot be
supplied by any other single word in the language. [Noah Webster, Dissertations on the English
Language, 1789]


charwoman (n.)

1590s, from Middle English char, cherre turn of work (see chore) + woman. An Alicia Charwoman
appears in the Borough of Nottingham records in 1379.


axe (n.)

Old English &aelig;ces (Northumbrian acas) axe, pickaxe, hatchet, later &aelig;x, from Proto-
Germanic *akusjo (cognates: Old Saxon accus, Old Norse ex, Old Frisian axe, German Axt, Gothic
aqizi), from PIE *agw(e)si- (cognates: Greek axine, Latin ascia).    The spelling ax is better on
every ground, of etymology, phonology, and analogy, than axe, which became prevalent during the 19th
century; but it is now disused in Britain. [OED]   <hr />   The spelling ax, though better on every
ground, of etymology, phonology, &amp; analogy (OED), is so strange to 20th-c. eyes that it suggests
pedantry &amp; is unlikely to be restored. [Fowler]    Meaning musical instrument is 1955,
originally jazz slang for the saxophone; rock slang for guitar dates to 1967. The axe in figurative
sense of cutting of anything (expenses, workers, etc.), especially as a cost-saving measure, is from
1922, probably from the notion of the headman's literal axe (itself attested from mid-15c.). To have
an axe to grind is from an 1815 essay by U.S. editor and politician Charles Miner (1780-1865) in
which a man flatters a boy and gets him to do the chore of axe-grinding for him, then leaves without
offering thanks or recompense. Misattributed to Benjamin Franklin in Weekley, OED print edition, and
many other sources.
