flag (n.1)

cloth ensign, late 15c., now in all modern Germanic languages, but apparently first recorded in
English, origin unknown, but likely connected with flag (v.) or else, like it, perhaps imitative. A
less likely guess is that it is from the flag in flagstone on notion of being square and flat. U.S.
Flag Day (1894) is in reference to the adopting of the Stars and Stripes by the Continental Congress
on June 14, 1777.
