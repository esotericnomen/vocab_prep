cloth ensign, late 15c., now in all modern Germanic languages, but apparently first recorded in
English, origin unknown, but likely connected with <a
href=/index.php?term=flag&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>flag</a> (v.) or else, like
it, perhaps imitative. A less likely guess is that it is from the flag in <a
href=/index.php?term=flagstone&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>flagstone</a> on notion
of being square and flat. U.S. Flag Day (1894) is in reference to the adopting of the Stars and
Stripes by the Continental Congress on June 14, 1777.
