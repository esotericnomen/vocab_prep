Old English cu cow, from Proto-Germanic *kwon (cognates: Old Frisian ku, Middle Dutch coe, Dutch
koe, Old High German kuo, German Kuh, Old Norse kyr, Danish, Swedish ko), earlier *kwom, from PIE
*gwous (cognates Sanskrit gaus, Greek bous, Latin bov-, Old Irish bo, Latvian guovs, Armenian gaus
cow, Slovak hovado ox), perhaps ultimately imitative of lowing (compare Sumerian gu, Chinese ngu,
ngo ox). In Germanic and Celtic, of females only; in most other languages, of either gender. Other
cow words sometimes are from roots meaning horn, horned, such as Lithuanian karve, Old Church
Slavonic krava.
