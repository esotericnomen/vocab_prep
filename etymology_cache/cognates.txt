bone (n.)

Old English ban bone, tusk, from Proto-Germanic *bainam (cognates: Old Frisian ben, Old Norse bein,
Danish ben, German Bein). No cognates outside Germanic (the common PIE root is *os-; see osseous);
the Norse, Dutch, and German cognates also mean shank of the leg, and this is the main meaning in
Modern German, but English never seems to have had this sense.
