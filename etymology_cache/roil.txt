1580s, of uncertain origin, probably from Middle French rouiller to rust, make muddy, from Old
French roil mud, muck, rust (12c.), from Vulgar Latin *robicula, from Latin robigo rust (see <a
href=/index.php?term=robust&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>robust</a>). An earlier
borrowing of the French verb is Middle English roil to roam or rove about (early 14c.). Related:
Roiled; roiling.
