roil (v.)

1580s, of uncertain origin, probably from Middle French rouiller to rust, make muddy, from Old
French roil mud, muck, rust (12c.), from Vulgar Latin *robicula, from Latin robigo rust (see
robust). An earlier borrowing of the French verb is Middle English roil to roam or rove about (early
14c.). Related: Roiled; roiling.


rile (v.)

1825, American English spelling alteration to reflect a dialectal pronunciation of roil (q.v.);
compare heist from hoist and in the same era spile for spoil (v.). Bartlett writes that in both
England and America roil is now commonly pronounced and written rile [Dictionary of Americanisms,
1848]. Related: Riled; riling.
