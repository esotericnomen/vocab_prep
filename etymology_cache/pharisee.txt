from Old English Fariseos, Old French pharise (13c.), and directly from Late Latin Pharis&aelig;us,
from Greek Pharisaios, from Aramaic perishayya, emphatic plural of perish separated, separatist,
corresponding to Hebrew parush, from parash he separated. Ancient Jewish sect (2c. B.C.E.-1c. C.E.)

(Matt. xxiii:27). Meaning self-righteous person, formalist, hypocrite is attested from 1580s.
