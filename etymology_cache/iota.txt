iota (n.)

anything very small. The letter name is from Semitic (compare Hebrew yodh).

jod (n.)

Medieval Latin spelling of Hebrew letter yodh (see iota). Also see jot (n.).


hoot (v.)

to call or shout in disapproval or scorn, c.1600, probably related to or a variant of Middle English
houten, huten to shout, call out (c.1200), probably ultimately imitative. First used of bird cries,
especially that of the owl, mid-15c. Related: Hooted; hooting. As a noun from mid-15c. Meaning a
laugh, something funny is first recorded 1942. Slang sense of smallest amount or particle (the hoot
you don't give when you don't care) is from 1891.    A dod blasted ole fool! answered the captain,
who, till now, had been merely an amused on-looker. Ye know all this rumpus wont do nobuddy a hoot
o' good--not a hoot. [Along Traverse Shores, Traverse City, Michigan, 1891]   Hooter in the same
sense is from 1839.   <b>HOOTER</b>. Probably a corruption of iota. Common in New York in such
phrases as I don't care a hooter for him. This note ain't worth a hooter. [John Russell Bartlett,
Dictionary of Americanisms, 1877]
