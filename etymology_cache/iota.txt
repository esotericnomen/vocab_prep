very small amount, 1630s, figurative use of iota, ninth and smallest letter in the Greek alphabet.
Modern use is after Matt. v:18 (see <a href=/index.php?term=jot&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>jot</a>), but iota in classical Greek also was proverbially used of anything
very small. The letter name is from Semitic (compare Hebrew yodh).
