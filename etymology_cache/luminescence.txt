luminescence (n.)

1884, from Latin lumen (genitive luminis) light (see luminous) + -escence.  <blockquote>
Fluorescence and Phosphorescence -- Prof. E. Wiedmann has made a new study of these phenomena. He
proposes the general name luminescence for evolutions of light which do not depend on the
temperature of the substance concerned. [Photographic News, April 20, 1888]  </blockquote>
