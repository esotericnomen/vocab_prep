c.1500, lying on the back, from Latin supinus bent backwards, thrown backwards, lying on the back,
figuratively inactive, indolent, from PIE *(s)up- (see <a
href=/index.php?term=sub-&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>sub-</a>). The grammatical use
for Latin verbal noun formed from the past participle stem (mid-15c.) is from Late Latin supinum
verbum supine verb, perhaps so called because, though furnished with a noun case ending, it falls
back on the verb. Related: Supinely.
