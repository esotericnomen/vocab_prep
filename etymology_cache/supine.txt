supine (adj.)

c.1500, lying on the back, from Latin supinus bent backwards, thrown backwards, lying on the back,
figuratively inactive, indolent, from PIE *(s)up- (see sub-). The grammatical use for Latin verbal
noun formed from the past participle stem (mid-15c.) is from Late Latin supinum verbum supine verb,
perhaps so called because, though furnished with a noun case ending, it falls back on the verb.
