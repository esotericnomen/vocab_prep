oaf (n.)

1620s, auf, oph (modern form from 1630s), a changeling; a foolish child left by the fairies
[Johnson], from a Scandinavian source such as Norwegian alfr silly person, in Old Norse elf (see
elf). Hence, a misbegotten, deformed idiot. Until recently, some dictionaries still gave the plural
as oaves.


oafish (adj.)

1610s, from oaf + -ish. Related: Oafishly; oafishness.


loaf (n.)

late 13c., from Old English hlaf portion of bread baked in a mass of definite form, from Proto-
Germanic *khlaibuz (cognates: Old Norse hleifr, Swedish lev, Old Frisian hlef, Old High German
hleib, German Laib, Gothic hlaifs bread, loaf), of uncertain origin, perhaps connected to Old
English hlifian to raise higher, tower, on the notion of the bread rising as it bakes, but it is
unclear whether loaf or bread is the original sense. Finnish leip&auml;, Old Church Slavonic chlebu,
Lithuanian klepas probably are Germanic loan words. Meaning chopped meat shaped like a bread loaf is
attested from 1787.


loaf (v.)

1835, American English, back-formation from loafer (1830). Related: Loafed; loafing.    The term
loafing is, of course, very vague. Its meaning, like that of its opposite, work, depends largely on
the user. The highly successful quarterback with an E in Greek is a loafer in his professor's eyes,
while the idea of the professor's working, in spite of his voluminous researches on Mycenean Table
Manners, would excite hoots of derision from the laborer that lays the drains before his study
window. [Yale Literary Magazine, May 1908]


loafer (n.)

idler, person who loafs, 1830, of uncertain origin, often regarded as a variant of land loper
(1795), a partial loan-translation of German Landl&auml;ufer vagabond, from Land land + L&auml;ufer
runner, from laufen to run (see leap (v.)). But OED finds this connection not very probable. As a
type of shoe, 1937. Related: Loafers.
