c.1300, maleise pain, suffering; sorrow, anxiety, also, by late 14c., disease, sickness, from Old
French malaise difficulty, suffering, hardship, literally ill-ease, from mal bad (see <a
href=/index.php?term=mal-&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>mal-</a>) + aise ease (see <a
href=/index.php?term=ease&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>ease</a> (n.)). The current
use is perhaps a mid-18c. reborrowing from Modern French. A Middle English verbal form, malasen to
trouble, distress (mid-15c.), from Old French malaisier, did not endure.
