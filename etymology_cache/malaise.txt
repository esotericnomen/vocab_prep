malaise (n.)

c.1300, maleise pain, suffering; sorrow, anxiety, also, by late 14c., disease, sickness, from Old
French malaise difficulty, suffering, hardship, literally ill-ease, from mal bad (see mal-) + aise
ease (see ease (n.)). The current use is perhaps a mid-18c. reborrowing from Modern French. A Middle
English verbal form, malasen to trouble, distress (mid-15c.), from Old French malaisier, did not
endure.
