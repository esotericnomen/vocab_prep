anodyne (adj.)

1540s, from Medieval Latin anodynus pain-removing, allaying pain, from Latin anodynus painless, from
Greek anodynos free from pain, from an- without (see an- (1)) + odyne pain, a word perhaps from PIE
root *ed- to eat (source of Lithuanian ed&#382;ioti to devour, bite, ed&#382;iotis to suffer pain;
see eat). In old slang, frequently a euphemism for death; as in anodyne necklace hangman's noose.
