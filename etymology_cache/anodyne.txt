1540s, from Medieval Latin anodynus pain-removing, allaying pain, from Latin anodynus painless, from
Greek anodynos free from pain, from an- without (see <a
href=/index.php?term=an-&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>an-</a> (1)) + odyne pain, a
word perhaps from PIE root *ed- to eat (source of Lithuanian ed&#382;ioti to devour, bite,
ed&#382;iotis to suffer pain; see <a href=/index.php?term=eat&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>eat</a>). In old slang, frequently a euphemism for death; as in anodyne
necklace hangman's noose.
