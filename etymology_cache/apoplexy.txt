late 14c., sudden fit of paralysis and dizziness, from Old French apoplexie or directly from Late
Latin apoplexia, from Greek apoplexia, from apoplessein to strike down and incapacitate, from apo-
off (see <a href=/index.php?term=apo-&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>apo-</a>), in this
case probably an intensive prefix, + plessein hit (cognates: <a
href=/index.php?term=plague&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>plague</a> (n.), also with a
root sense of stricken). The Latin translation, sideratio, means disease caused by a constellation.
