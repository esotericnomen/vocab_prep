apoplexy (n.)

late 14c., sudden fit of paralysis and dizziness, from Old French apoplexie or directly from Late
Latin apoplexia, from Greek apoplexia, from apoplessein to strike down and incapacitate, from apo-
off (see apo-), in this case probably an intensive prefix, + plessein hit (cognates: plague (n.),
also with a root sense of stricken). The Latin translation, sideratio, means disease caused by a
constellation.


apoplectic (adj.)

1610s, involving apoplexy, from French apoplectique (16c.), from Latin apoplecticus, from Greek
apoplektikos disabled by a stroke, crippled, struck dumb, from apoplektos, verbal adjective of
apoplessein (see apoplexy). Meaning showing symptoms of apoplexy (1721) gradually shaded into
enraged, very angry.
