astute (adj.)

1610s, from Latin astutus crafty, wary, shrewd; sagacious, expert, from astus cunning, cleverness,
adroitness, of uncertain origin, perhaps from Greek asty town, a word borrowed into Latin and with
an overtone of city sophistication (compare asteism). Related: Astutely; astuteness.


Pratt

the surname apparently is from Old English *pr&aelig;tt (adj.) cunning, astute; related to late Old
English noun pr&aelig;tt a trick (see pretty). As a type of pottery, named for Staffordshire pottery
manufacturer Felix Pratt (1780-1859).


pretty (adj.)

Old English pr&aelig;ttig (West Saxon), pretti (Kentish), *prettig (Mercian) cunning, skillful,
artful, wily, astute, from pr&aelig;tt, *prett a trick, wile, craft, from Proto-Germanic *pratt-
(cognates: Old Norse prettr a trick, prettugr tricky; Frisian pret, Middle Dutch perte, Dutch pret
trick, joke, Dutch prettig sportive, funny, Flemish pertig brisk, clever), of unknown origin.
Connection between Old English and Middle English words is uncertain, but if they are the same,
meaning had shifted by c.1400 to manly, gallant, and later moved via attractive, skillfully made, to
fine, to beautiful in a slight way (mid-15c.). Ironical use from 1530s. For sense evolution, compare
nice, silly. Also used of bees (c.1400). After the OE. period the word is unknown till the 15th c.,
when it becomes all at once frequent in various senses, none identical with the OE., though
derivable from it [OED].     Meaning not a few, considerable is from late 15c. With a sense of
moderately, qualifying adjectives and adverbs, since 1560s. Pretty please as an emphatic plea is
attested from 1902. A pretty penny lot of money is first recorded 1768.
