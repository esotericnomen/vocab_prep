genteel (adj.)

1590s, from Middle French gentil stylish, fashionable, elegant; nice, graceful, pleasing, from Old
French gentil high-born, noble (11c.); a reborrowing of the French word that had early come into
English as gentle (q.v.), with French pronunciation and stress preserved to emphasize the
distinction. See also jaunty; gentile. OED 2nd ed. reports genteel is now used, except by the
ignorant, only in mockery (a development it dates from the 1840s).


asteism (n.)

genteel irony, polite mockery, 1580s, from Greek asteismos wit, witticism, from asteios of a city or
town (as opposed to country), from asty town, city, especially (without the article) Athens.


doily (n.)

1714, short for doily-napkin (1711), from doily thin, woolen fabric; supposedly from Doiley, surname
of a 17c.-early 18c. dry-goods dealer on London's Strand. Doily earlier meant genteel, affordable
woolens (1670s), evidently from the same source. The surname is d'Ouilly, from one of several places
called Ouilly in Normandy.


shabby (adj.)

1660s, of persons, poorly dressed, with -y (2) + shab a low fellow (1630s), literally scab (now only
dialectal in the literal sense, in reference to a disease of sheep), from Old English sceabb (the
native form of the Scandinavian word that yielded Modern English scab; also see sh-). Similar
formation in Middle Dutch schabbich, German sch&auml;big shabby.    Of clothes, furniture, etc., of
mean appearance, no longer new or fresh from 1680s; meaning inferior in quality is from 1805.
Figurative sense contemptibly mean is from 1670s. Related: Shabbily; shabbiness. Shabby-genteel run-
down but trying to keep up appearances, retaining in present shabbiness traces of former gentility,
first recorded 1754. Related: Shabaroon disreputable person, c.1700.
