genteel (adj.)

1590s, from Middle French gentil stylish, fashionable, elegant; nice, graceful, pleasing, from Old
French gentil high-born, noble (11c.); a reborrowing of the French word that had early come into
English as gentle (q.v.), with French pronunciation and stress preserved to emphasize the
distinction. See also jaunty; gentile. OED 2nd ed. reports genteel is now used, except by the
ignorant, only in mockery (a development it dates from the 1840s).
