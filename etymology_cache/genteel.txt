1590s, from Middle French gentil stylish, fashionable, elegant; nice, graceful, pleasing, from Old
French gentil high-born, noble (11c.); a reborrowing of the French word that had early come into
English as <a href=/index.php?term=gentle&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>gentle</a>
(q.v.), with French pronunciation and stress preserved to emphasize the distinction. See also <a

href=/index.php?term=gentile&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>gentile</a>. OED 2nd ed.
reports genteel is now used, except by the ignorant, only in mockery (a development it dates from
the 1840s).
