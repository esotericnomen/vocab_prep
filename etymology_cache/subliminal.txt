subliminal (adj.)

1873, below the threshold (of consciousness or sensation), formed from Latin stem of sublime (Latin
limen, genitive liminis) + -al (1)). Apparently a loan-translation of German unter der Schwelle (des
Bewusstseins) beneath the threshold (of consciousness), from Johann Friedrich Herbart (1776-1841),
author of a textbook on psychology published in 1824. The scare over subliminal advertising came in
1957. Related: Subliminally.
