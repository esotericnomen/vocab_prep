1785, American English, perhaps from gaw, a survival from Middle English gowen to stare (c.1200),
from a Scandinavian source akin to Old Norse ga to heed, from Proto-Germanic *gawon-, from PIE
*ghow-e- to honor, revere, worship (see <a href=/index.php?term=favor&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>favor</a> (n.)); and altered perhaps by gawk hand (see <a
href=/index.php?term=gawky&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>gawky</a>). Liberman writes
that it need not have been derived from <a href=/index.php?term=gowk&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>gowk</a>. It is possibly another independent imitative formation with the
structure g-k. Related: Gawked; gawking.
