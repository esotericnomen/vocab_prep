gawk (v.)

1785, American English, perhaps from gaw, a survival from Middle English gowen to stare (c.1200),
from a Scandinavian source akin to Old Norse ga to heed, from Proto-Germanic *gawon-, from PIE
*ghow-e- to honor, revere, worship (see favor (n.)); and altered perhaps by gawk hand (see gawky).
Liberman writes that it need not have been derived from gowk. It is possibly another independent
imitative formation with the structure g-k. Related: Gawked; gawking.
