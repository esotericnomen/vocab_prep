gawk (v.)

1785, American English, perhaps from gaw, a survival from Middle English gowen to stare (c.1200),
from a Scandinavian source akin to Old Norse ga to heed, from Proto-Germanic *gawon-, from PIE
*ghow-e- to honor, revere, worship (see favor (n.)); and altered perhaps by gawk hand (see gawky).
Liberman writes that it need not have been derived from gowk. It is possibly another independent
imitative formation with the structure g-k. Related: Gawked; gawking.


gawky (adj.)

awkward, ungainly, 1724, from gawk hand left hand (1703), perhaps a contraction of gaulick, thus
gaulish hand, derogatory slang that could have originated during some period of strained Anglo-
French relations, i.e. most of recorded history.


gaze (v.)

late 14c., probably of Scandinavian origin (compare Norwegian, Swedish dialectal gasa to gape),
perhaps related somehow to Old Norse ga heed (see gawk). Related: Gazed; gazing.
