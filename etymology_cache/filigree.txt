wire (n.)

Old English wir metal drawn out into a fine thread, from Proto-Germanic *wira- (cognates: Old Norse
viravirka filigree work, Swedish vira to twist, Old High German wiara fine gold work), from PIE
*wei- (1) to turn, twist, plait (cognates: Old Irish fiar, Welsh gwyr bent, crooked; Latin viere to
bend, twist, viri&aelig; bracelets, of Celtic origin). A wire as marking the finish line of a
racecourse is attested from 1883; hence the figurative down to the wire. Wire-puller in the
political sense is 1848, American English, on the image of pulling the wires that work a puppet.
