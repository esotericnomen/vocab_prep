mid-15c., from Old French acreue growth, increase, what has grown, fem. of acreu, past participle of
acreistre (Modern French accro&icirc;tre) to increase, from Latin accrescere (see <a
href=/index.php?term=accretion&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>accretion</a>). Related:
Accrued; accruing. Apparently a verb from a French noun because there is no English verb to go with
it until much later, unless the record is defective.
