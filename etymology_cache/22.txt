Catch-22 (n.)

from the title of Joseph Heller's 1961 novel. In widespread use only after release of the movie
based on the book in 1970. The catch is that a bomber pilot is insane if he flies combat missions
without asking to be relieved from duty, and is thus eligible to be relieved from duty. But if he
asks to be relieved from duty, that means he's sane and has to keep flying.  <blockquote>There was
only one catch and that was Catch-22, which specified that a concern for one's safety in the face of
dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind. Orr was crazy and could be
grounded. All he had to do was ask; and as soon as he did, he would no longer be crazy and would
have to fly more missions. Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane if he didn't, but if he
was sane he had to fly them. If he flew them he was crazy and didn't have to; but if he didn't want
to he was sane and had to. Yossarian was moved very deeply by the absolute simplicity of this clause
of Catch-22 and let out a respectful whistle.  That's some catch, that Catch-22, he observed.It's
the best there is, Doc Daneeka agreed.</blockquote>  See catch (n.).
