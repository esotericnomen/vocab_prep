audacity (n.)

mid-15c., from Medieval Latin audacitas boldness, from Latin audacis genitive of audax (see
audacious).


presumption (n.)

mid-13c., seizure and occupation without right, also taking upon oneself more than is warranted,
from Old French presumcion (12c., Modern French pr&#233;somption) and directly from Late Latin
praesumptionem (nominative praesumptio) confidence, audacity, in classical Latin, a taking for
granted, anticipation, noun of action from past participle stem of praesumere to take beforehand,
from prae before (see pre-) + sumere to take (see exempt (adj.)). In English, the meaning the taking
of something for granted is attested from c.1300. Presumptuous preserves the older sense.


effrontery (n.)

1715, from French effronterie, from effront&eacute; shameless, from Old French esfronte shameless,
brazen, probably from Late Latin effrontem (nominative effrons) barefaced, from Latin ex- out (see
ex-) + frontem (nominative frons) brow (see front (n.)).    Latin frontus had a sense of ability to
blush, but the literal sense of effrontery often has been taken to be putting forth the forehead.
Forehead in Johnson's Dictionary (1755) has a secondary sense of impudence; confidence; assurance;
audaciousness; audacity.
