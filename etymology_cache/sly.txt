sly (adj.)

c.1200, skillful, clever, dexterous, from Old Norse sloegr cunning, crafty, sly, from Proto-Germanic
*slogis (cognates: Low German slu cunning, sly, German schlau), probably from base *slak- to strike,
hit (see slay (v.)), with an original notion of able to hit. Compare German verschlagen cunning,
crafty, sly, schlagfertig quick-witted, literally strike-ready, from schlagen to strike. A non-
pejorative use of the word lingered in northern English dialect until 20c. On the sly in secret is
recorded from 1812. Sly-boots a seeming Silly, but subtil Fellow is in the 1700 Dictionary of the
Canting Crew.
