careen (v.)

1590s, to turn a ship on its side (with the keel exposed), from French cariner, literally to expose
a ship's keel, from Middle French carene keel (16c.), from Italian (Genoese dialect) carena, from
Latin carina keel of a ship, originally nutshell, possibly from PIE root *kar- hard (see hard
(adj.)).     Intransitive sense of to lean, to tilt is from 1763, specifically of ships; in general
use by 1883. In sense to rush headlong, confused with career (v.) since at least 1923. [To career is
to move rapidly; to careen is to lurch from side to side (often while moving rapidly).] Earlier
figurative uses of careen were to be laid up; to rest. Related: Careened; careening.
