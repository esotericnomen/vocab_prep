rue (v.)

feel regret, Old English hreowan make sorry, distress, grieve (class II strong verb; past tense
hreaw, past participle hrowen), from Proto-Germanic *khrewan (cognates: Old Frisian riowa, Middle
Dutch rouwen, Old Dutch hrewan, German reuen to sadden, cause repentance); in part, blended with Old
English weak verb hreowian feel pain or sorrow, and perhaps influenced by Old Norse hryggja make
sad, both from Proto-Germanic *khruwjan, all from PIE root *kreue- (2) to push, strike (see
anacrusis). Related: Rued; ruing.
