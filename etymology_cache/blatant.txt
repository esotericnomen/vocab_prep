blatant (adj.)

1596, in blatant beast, coined by Edmund Spenser in The Faerie Queen to describe a thousand-tongued
monster representing slander; probably suggested by Latin blatire to babble. It entered general use
1650s, as noisy in an offensive and vulgar way; the sense of obvious, glaringly conspicuous is from
1889. Related: Blatantly.


gerrymander

1812 as both a noun and verb, American English, from Elbridge Gerry + (sala)mander. Gerry, governor
of Massachusetts, was lampooned when his party redistricted the state in a blatant bid to preserve
an Antifederalist majority. One Essex County district resembled a salamander, and a newspaper editor
dubbed it Gerrymander. Related: Gerrymandered; gerrymandering.
