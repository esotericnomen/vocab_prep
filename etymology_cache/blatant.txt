1596, in blatant beast, coined by Edmund Spenser in The Faerie Queen to describe a thousand-tongued
monster representing slander; probably suggested by Latin blatire to babble. It entered general use
1650s, as noisy in an offensive and vulgar way; the sense of obvious, glaringly conspicuous is from
1889. Related: Blatantly.
