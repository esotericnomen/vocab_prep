waft (v.)

c.1500, transitive, to move gently (through the air), probably from Middle Dutch or Middle Low
German, ultimately from wachten to guard (perhaps via notion of a ship that guards another as it
sails), related to waken rouse from sleep, from Proto-Germanic *waht- (see wake (n.1)). Possibly
influenced by northern dialect waff cause to move to and fro (1510s), a variant of wave.
Intransitive sense from 1560s. Related: Wafted; wafting.


waffle (v.)

1690s, to yelp, bark, frequentative of provincial waff to yelp, to bark like a puppy (1610);
possibly of imitative origin. Figurative sense of talk foolishly (c.1700) led to that of vacillate,
equivocate (1803), originally a Scottish and northern English usage. Late 17c. Scottish also had
waff act of waving, variant of waft, which might have influenced the sense. Related: Waffled;
waffler; waffling.
