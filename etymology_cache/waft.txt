c.1500, transitive, to move gently (through the air), probably from Middle Dutch or Middle Low
German, ultimately from wachten to guard (perhaps via notion of a ship that guards another as it
sails), related to waken rouse from sleep, from Proto-Germanic *waht- (see <a
href=/index.php?term=wake&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>wake</a> (n.1)). Possibly
influenced by northern dialect waff cause to move to and fro (1510s), a variant of wave.
Intransitive sense from 1560s. Related: Wafted; wafting.
