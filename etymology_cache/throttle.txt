1540s, throat; it appears to be an independent formation from <a
href=/index.php?term=throat&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>throat</a>, perhaps a
diminutive form, not derived directly from the verb. The mechanical sense is first recorded 1872,
short for throttle-valve (1824). Full-throttle (allowing maximum speed) is from 1848 in reference to
steam engines.
