veer (v.)

1580s, to change direction (originally of the wind; 1610s of a ship), from Middle French virer to
turn (12c.), of uncertain origin, perhaps (Diez) from the Latin stem vir- in viriae (plural)
bracelets. Gamillscheg finds von Wartburg's derivation of it from a Vulgar Latin contraction of
Latin vibrare to shake to be nicht m&#246;glich. Related: veered, veering.
