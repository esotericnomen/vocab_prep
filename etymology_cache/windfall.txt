windfall (n.)

mid-15c., from wind (n.1) + fall (n.1). Originally literal, in reference to wood or fruit blown down
by the wind, and thus free to all. Figurative sense of unexpected acquisition is recorded from
1540s.


Dick Whittington

The story is an old one, told under other names throughout Europe, of a poor boy who sends a cat he
had bought for a penny as his stake in a trading voyage; the captain sells it on his behalf for a
fortune to a foreign king whose palace is overrun by rats. The hero devotes part of his windfall to
charity, which may be why the legend attached in England since 16c. to Sir Richard Whittington
(d.1423), three times Lord Mayor of London, who died childless and devoted large sums in his will to
churches, almshouses, and St. Bartholomew's Hospital.
