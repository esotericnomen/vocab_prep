dossier (n.)

1880, from French dossier bundle of papers, from dos back (12c.), from Vulgar Latin dossum, variant
of Latin dorsum back (see dorsal). Supposedly so called because the bundle bore a label on the back,
or possibly from resemblance of the bulge in a mass of bundled papers to the curve of a back. Old
French dossiere meant back-strap, ridge strap (of a horse's harness).


do-si-do

1929, from French dos-&agrave;-dos back to back (see dossier).


parados (n.)

rear wall of a trench, 1917, earlier elevation behind a fortified place (1853), literally defense
from the back, from French parados, from para- defense (see para- (2)) + dos back (see dossier).


reredos (n.)

screen behind an altar, late 14c., from Anglo-French rere-, archaic comb. form of rear (n.), + dos
back (see dossier). Klein's sources suggest it is aphetic of Anglo-French areredos, from Old French
arere at the back (Modern French arri&#232;re).
