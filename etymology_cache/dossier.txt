1880, from French dossier bundle of papers, from dos back (12c.), from Vulgar Latin dossum, variant
of Latin dorsum back (see <a href=/index.php?term=dorsal&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>dorsal</a>). Supposedly so called because the bundle bore a label on the back,
or possibly from resemblance of the bulge in a mass of bundled papers to the curve of a back. Old
French dossiere meant back-strap, ridge strap (of a horse's harness).
