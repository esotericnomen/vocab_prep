clarion (n.)

small, high-pitched type of trumpet, early 14c., from Old French clarion (high-pitched) trumpet,
bugle and directly from Medieval Latin clarionem (nominative clario) a trumpet, from Latin clarus
clear (see clear (adj.)). Clarion call is attested from 1838.


accordion (n.)

1831, from German Akkordion, from Akkord musical chord, concord of sounds, be in tune (compare
Italian accordare to attune an instrument); ultimately from same source as English accord (v.), with
suffix on analogy of clarion, etc. Invented 1829 by piano-maker Cyrill Demian (1772-1847) of Vienna.


clarinet (n.)

1768, from French clarinette (18c.), diminutive of clarine little bell (16c.), noun use of fem. of
adjective clarin (which also was used as a noun, trumpet, clarion), from clair, cler (see clear
(adj.)). Alternative form clarionet is attested from 1784.    The instrument, a modification of the
medieval shawm, said to have been invented c.1700 by J.C. Denner of Nuremberg, Germany. A recognized
orchestral instrument from c.1775. Ease of playing increased greatly with a design improvement from
1843 based on Boehm's flute.    After the hautboy came the clarinet. This instrument astonished
every beholder, not so much, perhaps, on account of its sound, as its machinery. One that could
manage the keys of a clarinet, forty five years ago, so as to play a tune, was one of the wonders of
the age. Children of all ages would crowd around the performer, and wonder and admire when the keys
were moved. [Nathaniel D. Gould, Church Music in America, Boston, 1853]    German Clarinet, Swedish
klarinett, Italian clarinetto, etc. all are from French. Related: Clarinettist.
