equivocate (v.)

early 15c., equivocaten, from Medieval Latin equivocatus, past participle of equivocare to call by
the same name, from Late Latin aequivocus (see equivocation). Related: Equivocated; equivocating.


quibble (v.)

equivocate, evade the point, turn from the point in question or the plain truth, 1650s, from quibble
(n.). Earlier to pun (1620s). Related: Quibbled; quibbling.


waffle (v.)

1690s, to yelp, bark, frequentative of provincial waff to yelp, to bark like a puppy (1610);
possibly of imitative origin. Figurative sense of talk foolishly (c.1700) led to that of vacillate,
equivocate (1803), originally a Scottish and northern English usage. Late 17c. Scottish also had
waff act of waving, variant of waft, which might have influenced the sense. Related: Waffled;
waffler; waffling.


weasel (v.)

to deprive (a word or phrase) of its meaning, 1900, from weasel (n.); so used because the weasel
sucks out the contents of eggs, leaving the shell intact. Both this and weasel-word are first
attested in The Stained-Glass Political Platform, a short story by Stewart Chaplin, first printed in
Century Magazine, June 1900:    Why, weasel words are words that suck all the life out of the words
next to them, just as a weasel sucks an egg and leaves the shell. If you heft the egg afterward it's
as light as a feather, and not very filling when you're hungry; but a basketful of them would make
quite a show, and would bamboozle the unwary.    They were picked up at once in American political
slang. The sense of extricate oneself (from a difficult place) like a weasel is first recorded 1925;
that of to evade and equivocate is from 1956. Related: Weasled; weasling.
