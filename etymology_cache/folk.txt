1846, coined by antiquarian William J. Thoms (1803-1885) as an Anglo-Saxonism (replacing popular
antiquities) and first published in the Athenaeum of Aug. 22, 1846, from <a
href=/index.php?term=folk&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>folk</a> + <a
href=/index.php?term=lore&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>lore</a>. Old English folclar
meant homily.  <br /><br />  This word revived folk in a modern sense of of the common people, whose
culture is handed down orally, and opened up a flood of compound formations, as in folk art (1892),
folk-hero (1874), folk-medicine (1877), folk-tale/folk tale (1850; Old English folctalu meant
genealogy), folk-song (1847), folk singer (1876), folk-dance (1877).
