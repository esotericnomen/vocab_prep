bedizen (v.)

1660s, from be- + dizen to dress (1610s), especially, from late 18c., to dress finely, adorn,
originally to dress (a distaff) for spinning (1520s), and evidently the verbal form of the first
element in distaff.  <blockquote>  It is remarkable that neither the vb., nor the sb. as a separate
word, has been found in OE. or ME., and that on the other hand no vb. corresponding to dizen is
known in L.G. or Du. [OED]  </blockquote>
