bedizen (v.)

1660s, from be- + dizen to dress (1610s), especially, from late 18c., to dress finely, adorn,
originally to dress (a distaff) for spinning (1520s), and evidently the verbal form of the first
element in distaff.    It is remarkable that neither the vb., nor the sb. as a separate word, has
been found in OE. or ME., and that on the other hand no vb. corresponding to dizen is known in L.G.
or Du. [OED]


distaff (n.)

Old English dist&aelig;f stick that holds flax for spinning, from dis- bunch of flax (cognates:
Middle Low German dise, Low German diesse a bunch of flax on a distaff; see bedizen) + st&aelig;f
stick, staff (see staff).     A synonym in English for the female sex, female authority in the
family, since at least the late 1400s, probably because in the Middle Ages spinning was typically
done by women. St. Distaff's Day was Jan. 7, when women resumed their spinning and other ordinary
employments after the holidays [OED].
