to dress (1610s), especially, from late 18c., to dress finely, adorn, originally to dress (a
distaff) for spinning (1520s), and evidently the verbal form of the first element in <a
href=/index.php?term=distaff&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>distaff</a>.  <blockquote>
It is remarkable that neither the vb., nor the sb. as a separate word, has been found in OE. or ME.,
and that on the other hand no vb. corresponding to dizen is known in L.G. or Du. [OED]
