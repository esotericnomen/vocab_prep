kinetic (adj.)

relating to motion, 1841, from Greek kinetikos moving, putting in motion, from kinetos moved, verbal
adjective of kinein to move (see cite).    Buster Keaton's subject was kinetic man, a being he
approached with the almost metaphysical awe we reserve for a Doppelg&auml;nger. This being was,
eerily, himself, played by himself, then later in a projection room, watched by himself: an
experience never possible to any generation of actors in the previous history of the world. [Hugh
Kenner, The Counterfeiters, 1968]    Related: Kinetical; kinetically.
