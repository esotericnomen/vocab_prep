palate (n.)

late 14c., roof of the mouth, from Old French palat and directly from Latin palatum roof of the
mouth, perhaps of Etruscan origin [Klein]. Popularly considered the seat of taste, hence transferred
meaning sense of taste (late 14c.), which also was in classical Latin. Related: Palatal; palatalize.
