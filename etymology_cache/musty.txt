musty (adj.)

1520s, perhaps a variant of moisty moist, damp (see moist). Related: Mustiness.


mucilage (n.)

late 14c., mussillage, viscous substance found in vegetable material, from Old French mucilage
(14c.), from Late Latin mucilago musty or moldy juice (4c.), from Latin mucere be musty or moldy,
from mucus mucus  (see mucus). Meaning adhesive is first attested 1859.


must (n.2)

mold, c.1600, perhaps a back-formation of musty (q.v.).


funky (adj.)

1784, old, musty, in reference to cheeses, then repulsive, from funk (n.2) + -y (2). It began to
develop an approving sense in jazz slang c.1900, probably on the notion of earthy, strong, deeply
felt. Funky also was used early 20c. by white writers in reference to body odor allegedly peculiar
to blacks. The word reached wider popularity c.1954 (it was defined in Time magazine, Nov. 8, 1954)
and in the 1960s acquired a broad slang sense of fine, stylish, excellent.


footle (v.)

to trifle, 1892, from dialectal footer to trifle, footy mean, paltry (1752), perhaps from French se
foutre to care nothing, from Old French foutre to copulate with, from Latin futuere, originally to
strike, thrust (see confute). But OED derives the English dialect words from foughty (c.1600), from
Dutch vochtig or Danish fugtig damp, musty; related to fog (n.).


mucus (n.)

1660s (replacing Middle English mucilage), from Latin mucus slime, mold, mucus of the nose, snot,
from PIE root *meug- slippery, slimy, with derivatives referring to wet or slimy substances or
conditions (cognates: Latin emungere to sneeze out, blow one's nose, mucere be moldy or musty, Greek
myssesthai to blow the nose, myxa mucus, mykes fungus, Sanskrit muncati he releases). Old English
had horh, which may be imitative.


moist (adj.)

late 14c., moist, wet; well-irrigated, from Old French moiste damp, wet, soaked (13c., Modern French
moite), from Vulgar Latin *muscidus moldy, also wet, from Latin mucidus slimy, moldy, musty, from
mucus slime (see mucus). Alternative etymology [Diez] is from Latin musteus fresh, green, new,
literally like new wine, from musteum new wine (see must (n.1)). If this wasn't the source, it
influenced the form of the other word in Old French. Related: Moistly; moistness.
