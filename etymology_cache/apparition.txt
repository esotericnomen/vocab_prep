c.1500, unclosing (of Heaven), from Anglo-French aparicion, Old French apparition, aparoison (15c.),
used in reference to the Epiphany (revealing of Christ child to the Wise Men), from Late Latin
apparitionem (nominative apparitio) an appearance, also attendants, in classical Latin service,
servants, noun of action from past participle stem of apparere appear (see <a
href=/index.php?term=appear&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>appear</a>). Meaning ghost
first recorded c.1600; the shade of sense differentiation between appearance and apparition is that
the latter tends to be unexpected or startling.
