indentation (n.)

1728, of margins or edges, extended form of indent (n.). Meaning action of making a dent or
impression is from 1847.


dent (n.)

early 14c., a strike or blow, dialectal variant of Middle English dint (q.v.); sense of indentation
first recorded 1560s, apparently influenced by indent.


indention (n.)

1763, formed irregularly from indent + -ation. It could be a useful word if it split with
indentation the two senses (relating to margins and to dents) of that word, but indention, too, is
used in both.


indenture (n.)

contract for services, late 14c., from Anglo-French endenture, Old French endenteure indentation,
from endenter (see indent). Such contracts (especially between master craftsmen and apprentices)
were written in full identical versions on a sheet of parchment, which was then cut apart in a
zigzag, or notched line. Each party took one, and the genuineness of a document of indenture could
be proved by juxtaposition with its counterpart. As a verb, 1650s, from the noun.


Adam&#039;s apple (n.)

1731, corresponding to Latin pomum Adami, perhaps an inexact translation of Hebrew tappuah haadam,
literally man's swelling, from ha-adam the man + tappuah anything swollen. The reference is to the
legend that a piece of the forbidden fruit (commonly believed to be an apple) that Eve gave Adam
stuck in his throat. The term is mentioned in early 15c. as the name of an actual oriental and
Mediterranean fruit, a variety of lime with an indentation fancied to resemble the marks of Adam's
teeth.


bight (n.)

Old English byht bend, angle, corner (related to bow), from Proto-Germanic *buhtiz (cognates: Middle
Low German bucht, German Bucht, Dutch bocht, Danish bught bight, bay), from PIE root *bheug- (3) to
bend, with derivatives referring to bent, pliable, or curved objects (cognates: Old English beag,
Old High German boug ring; see bow (v.)). Sense of indentation on a coastline is from late 15c.
