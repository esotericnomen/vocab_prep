boisterous (adj.)

late 15c., unexplained alteration of Middle English boistous (c.1300) rough, coarse (as of food),
clumsy, violent, of unknown origin, perhaps from Anglo-French bustous rough (road), which is perhaps
from Old French boisteos curved, lame; uneven, rough (Modern French boiteux), itself of obscure
origin. Another guess traces it via Celtic to Latin bestia. Used of persons from 1560s. Related:
Boisterously; boisterousness.
