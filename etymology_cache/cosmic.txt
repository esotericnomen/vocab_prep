cosmic (adj.)

of the universe is from 1846. Cosmical is attested from 1580s.


psychokinesis (n.)

nebula (n.)

early 15c., nebule a cloud, mist, from Latin nebula mist, vapor, fog, smoke, exhalation,
figuratively darkness, obscurity, from PIE *nebh- cloud (cognates: Sanskrit nabhas- vapor, cloud,
mists, fog, sky; Greek nephele, nephos cloud; German nebel fog; Old English nifol dark, gloomy;
Welsh niwl cloud, fog; Slavic nebo).    Re-borrowed from Latin 1660s in sense of cataracts in the
eye; astronomical meaning cloud-like patch in the night sky first recorded c.1730. As early as
Hershel (1802) astronomers realized that some nebulae were star clusters, but certain distinction of
relatively nearby cosmic gas clouds from distant galaxies was not made until 1920s, using the new
100-inch Mt. Wilson telescope.


swastika (n.)

Greek cross with arms bent at right angles, 1871 (in English specifically as emblem of the Nazi
party from 1932), from Sanskrit svastika-s, literally being fortunate, from svasti-s well-being,
luck, from su- well (from PIE *(e)su- good) + as-, root of asti (he) is, which is from the same PIE
root as Latin esse to be (see essence).    Also known as gammadion (Byzantine), cross cramponnee
(heraldry), Thor's hammer, and, perhaps, fylfot. Originally an ancient cosmic or religious symbol
thought to bring good luck. Use in reference to the Nazi emblem first recorded in English in 1932.
The German word was Hakenkreuz, literally hook-cross.
