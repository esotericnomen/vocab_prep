mid-14c., to shine; c.1500, to stare with wide eyes, perhaps from a Scandinavian source (compare
Norwegian dialectal glora to glow), from Proto-Germanic base *glo- (see <a
href=/index.php?term=glow&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>glow</a> (v.)), root of Old
English glowan to glow, which influenced the spelling. Or perhaps related to Middle Dutch gluren to
leer. Meaning to look angrily, scowl is first recorded 1775. Related: Glowered; glowering. As a
noun, 1715, from the verb.
