glower (v.)

mid-14c., to shine; c.1500, to stare with wide eyes, perhaps from a Scandinavian source (compare
Norwegian dialectal glora to glow), from Proto-Germanic base *glo- (see glow (v.)), root of Old
English glowan to glow, which influenced the spelling. Or perhaps related to Middle Dutch gluren to
leer. Meaning to look angrily, scowl is first recorded 1775. Related: Glowered; glowering. As a
noun, 1715, from the verb.
