timbrel (n.)

percussive Middle Eastern instrument, c.1500, diminutive of timbre (14c.), from Old French timbre in
its older sense of drum (see timbre). Used in Bible translations, chiefly to render Hebrew toph,
cognate with Arabic duff drum, of imitative origin.


timbre (n.)

characteristic quality of a musical sound, 1849, from French timbre quality of a sound, earlier
sound of a bell, from Old French, bell without a clapper, originally small drum, probably via
Medieval Greek *timbanon, from Greek tympanon kettledrum (see tympanum). Timbre was used in Old
French (13c.) and Middle English (14c.) to render Latin tympanum in Ps. 150.


tambourine (n.)

1782, in the modern sense of parchment-covered hoop with pieces of metal attached; earlier a small
drum (1570s), from French tambourin long narrow drum used in Provence, diminutive of tambour drum,
altered by influence of Arabic tunbur lute, from Old French tabour (see tabor).    The sense
evolutions present some difficulties, and in some 17c. and early 18c. references it is difficult to
say what sort of instrument is intended. Earlier names for this type of instrument were tambour de
basque (1680s), also timbre and timbrel. Tambour itself is attested in English from late 15c., and
Shakespeare has tabourine.
