1610s, from Greek misogynes woman-hater (see misogyny).


misogynistic (adj.)

1821, from misogynist + -ic.


woman (n.)

adult female human, late Old English wimman, wiman (plural wimmen), literally woman-man, alteration
of wifman (plural wifmen) woman, female servant (8c.), a compound of wif woman (see wife) + man
human being (in Old English used in reference to both sexes; see man (n.)). Compare Dutch vrouwmens
wife, literally woman-man.    It is notable that it was thought necessary to join wif, a neuter
noun, representing a female person, to man, a masc. noun representing either a male or female
person, to form a word denoting a female person exclusively. [Century Dictionary]    The formation
is peculiar to English and Dutch. Replaced older Old English wif and quean as the word for female
human being. The pronunciation of the singular altered in Middle English by the rounding influence
of -w-; the plural retains the original vowel. Meaning wife, now largely restricted to U.S.
dialectal use, is attested from mid-15c. Woman-hater misogynist is from c.1600. Women's work is from
1660s. Women's liberation is attested from 1966; women's rights is from 1840, with an isolated
example in 1630s.
