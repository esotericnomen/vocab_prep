gambit (n.)

chess opening in which a pawn is risked for advantage later, 1650s, gambett, from Italian gambetto,
literally a tripping up (as a trick in wrestling), from gamba leg, from Late Latin gamba (see
gambol). Applied to chess openings in Spanish in 1561 by Ruy Lopez, who traced it to the Italian
word, but the form in Spanish generally was gambito, which led to French gambit, which has
influenced the English spelling of the word. Broader sense of opening move meant to gain advantage
in English is recorded from 1855.
