cerebral (adj.)

1816, pertaining to the brain, from French c&eacute;r&eacute;bral (16c.), from Latin cerebrum the
brain (also the understanding), from PIE *keres-, from root *ker- (1) top of the head (see horn
(n.)). Meaning intellectual, clever is from 1929. Cerebral palsy attested from 1824, originally a
general term for cases of paralysis that seemed to be traceable to a morbid state of the encephalon.
Later used in a more specific sense from c.1860, based on the work of English surgeon Dr. William
Little.
