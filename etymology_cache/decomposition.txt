retort (n.2)

vessel used in chemistry for distilling or effecting decomposition by the aid of heat, c.1600, from
Middle French retorte, from Medieval Latin *retorta a retort, a vessel with a bent neck, literally a

Vaseline (n.)

1872, trademark for an ointment made from petroleum and marketed by Chesebrough Manufacturing Co.,
coined from German Wasser water + Greek elaion oil + scientific-sounded ending -ine. Robert A.
Chesebrough was of the opinion that petroleum was a product of the underground decomposition of
water.    The name is of mixed origin, being derived from Wasser, water, and elaion [Greek in the
original], oil (water-oil), and indicates the belief of the discoverer that petroleum, the mother of
Vaseline, is produced by the agency of heat and pressure from the carbon of certain rocks, and the
hydrogen of water. [The Monthly Review of Dental Surgery, February 1877]
