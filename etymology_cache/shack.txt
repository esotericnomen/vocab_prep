1878, American English and Canadian English, of unknown origin, perhaps from Mexican Spanish jacal,
from Nahuatl (Aztecan) xacalli wooden hut. Or perhaps a back-formation from dialectal English
shackly shaky, rickety (1843), a derivative of shack, a dialectal variant of <a
href=/index.php?term=shake&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>shake</a> (v.). Another
theory derives shack from <a href=/index.php?term=ramshackle&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>ramshackle</a>.  <br /><br />  Slang meaning house attested by 1910. In early
radio enthusiast slang, it was the word for a room or office set aside for wireless use, 1919,
perhaps from earlier U.S. Navy use (1917). As a verb, 1891 in the U.S. West in reference to men who
hole up for the winter; from 1927 as to put up for the night; phrase shack up cohabit first recorded
1935 (in Zora Neale Hurston).
