shack (n.)

1878, American English and Canadian English, of unknown origin, perhaps from Mexican Spanish jacal,
from Nahuatl (Aztecan) xacalli wooden hut. Or perhaps a back-formation from dialectal English
shackly shaky, rickety (1843), a derivative of shack, a dialectal variant of shake (v.). Another
theory derives shack from ramshackle.    Slang meaning house attested by 1910. In early radio
enthusiast slang, it was the word for a room or office set aside for wireless use, 1919, perhaps
from earlier U.S. Navy use (1917). As a verb, 1891 in the U.S. West in reference to men who hole up
for the winter; from 1927 as to put up for the night; phrase shack up cohabit first recorded 1935
(in Zora Neale Hurston).
