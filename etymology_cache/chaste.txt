c.1200, virtuous, pure from unlawful sexual intercourse (as defined by the Church), from Old French
chaste morally pure (12c.), from Latin castus clean, pure, morally pure (see <a
href=/index.php?term=caste&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>caste</a>). Transferred sense
of sexually pure is by 15c., perhaps by influence of <a

chaste as a noun meaning virgin person is recorded from early 14c. Related: Chastely.
