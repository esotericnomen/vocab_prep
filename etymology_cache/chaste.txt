chaste (adj.)

c.1200, virtuous, pure from unlawful sexual intercourse (as defined by the Church), from Old French
chaste morally pure (12c.), from Latin castus clean, pure, morally pure (see caste). Transferred
sense of sexually pure is by 15c., perhaps by influence of chastity, though chaste as a noun meaning
virgin person is recorded from early 14c. Related: Chastely.
