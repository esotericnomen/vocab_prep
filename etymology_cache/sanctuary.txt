sanctuary (n.)

early 14c., building set apart for holy worship, from Anglo-French sentuarie, Old French saintuaire
sacred relic, holy thing; reliquary, sanctuary, from Late Latin sanctuarium a sacred place, shrine
(especially the Hebrew Holy of Holies; see sanctum), also a private room, from Latin sanctus holy
(see saint (n.)).    Since the time of Constantine and by medieval Church law, fugitives or debtors
enjoyed immunity from arrest in certain churches, hence transferred sense of immunity from
punishment (late 14c.). Exceptions were made in England in cases of treason and sacrilege. General
(non-ecclesiastical) sense of place of refuge or protection is attested from 1560s; as land set
aside for wild plants or animals to breed and live it is recorded from 1879.
