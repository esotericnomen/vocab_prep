c.1600, a dictionary, from Middle French lexicon or directly from Modern Latin lexicon, from Greek
lexikon (biblion) word (book), from neuter of lexikos pertaining to words, from lexis word, from
legein say (see <a href=/index.php?term=lecture&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>lecture</a> (n.)).  <br /><br />  Used originally of dictionaries of Greek,
Syriac, Hebrew and Arabic, because these typically were in Latin and in Modern Latin lexicon, not
dictionarius, was the preferred word. The modern sense of vocabulary proper to some sphere of
activity (1640s) is a figurative extension.
