touchy (adj.)

apt to take offense at slight provocation, c.1600, perhaps an alteration of tetchy (q.v.) influenced
by touch (v.). Related: Touchiness.


thin (adj.)

Old English &thorn;ynne narrow, lean, scanty, not dense; fluid, tenuous; weak, poor, from Proto-
Germanic *thunni thin (cognates: West Frisian ten, Middle Low German dunne, Middle Dutch dunne,
Dutch dun, Old High German dunni, German d&uuml;nn, Old Norse &thorn;unnr, Swedish tunn, Danish
tynd), from PIE *tnu- stretched, stretched out (hence thin), from root *ten- to stretch (cognates:
Latin tenuis thin, slender; see tenet).    These our actors ... were all Spirits, and Are melted
into Ayre, into thin Ayre. [Shakespeare, The Tempest, IV.i.150, 1610]    Loose or sparse, hence
easily seen through, with figurative extensions. Related: Thinly; thinness. Thin-skinned is attested
from 1590s; the figurative sense of touchy is from 1670s.


feisty (adj.)

1896, aggressive, exuberant, touchy, American English, with -y (2) + feist small dog, earlier fice,
fist (American English, 1805); short for fysting curre stinking cur, attested from 1520s, from
Middle English fysten, fisten break wind (mid-15c.); related to Old English fisting stink, from
Proto-Germanic *fistiz- a fart, said to be from PIE *pezd- (see fart), but there are difficulties.
The 1811 slang dictionary defines fice as a small windy escape backwards, more obvious to the nose
than ears; frequently by old ladies charged on their lap-dogs. Compare also Danish fise to blow, to
fart, and obsolete English aske-fise, fire-tender, literally ash-blower (early 15c.), from an
unrecorded Norse source, used in Middle English for a kind of bellows, but originally a term of
reproach among northern nations for an unwarlike fellow who stayed at home in the chimney corner
[OED].
