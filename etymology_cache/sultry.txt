sultry (adj.)

1590s, oppressively hot, close and moist (of weather), ultimately from swelter + alteration of -y
(2), either as a contraction of sweltry or from obsolete verb sulter to swelter (1580s), alteration
of swelter. Figurative sense of hot with lust is attested from 1704; of women, lascivious, sensual,
arousing desire it is recorded from 1940. Related: Sultriness.


simoom (n.)

hot, dry desert wind, 1790, from Arabic samum a sultry wind, literally poisonous, from samma he
poisoned, from sam poison.


vamp (n.2)

seductive woman who exploits men, 1911, short for vampire. First attested use is earlier than the
release of the Fox film A Fool There Was (January 1915), with sultry Theda Bara in the role of The
Vampire. The movie was based on a play of that name that had been on Broadway in 1909 (title and
concept from a Kipling poem, The Vampire, inspired by a Burne-Jones painting). The stage lead seems
to have been played by Kathryn Kaelred and Bernice Golden Henderson. At any rate, Bara (born
Theodosia Goodman) remains the classic vamp and the word's wide currency is attributable to her
performance.    A fool there was and he made his prayer       (Even as you and I!)  To a rag and a
bone and a hank of hair       (We called her the woman who did not care)  But the fool, he called
her his lady fair       (Even as you and I.)  [Kipling, The Vampire]


Selene

moon goddess, equivalent of Latin Luna, from Greek selene the moon; name of the moon goddess,

pertaining to the moon as a world, 1660s.
