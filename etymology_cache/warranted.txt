class=crossreference>ski</a> (v.).  <blockquote>  THE new sport which has lately been introduced at
Beloit is skeeing. They are long ash planks, carefully and turned up at the end, and are warranted
to take down hill quicker than a wink. After some practice performers become very expert, and the
speed with which they go is something surprising. [Beloit College, Wisconsin, Round Table, Dec. 18,
1885]  </blockquote>
