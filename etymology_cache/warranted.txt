skiing (n.)

1885, verbal noun from ski (v.).    THE new sport which has lately been introduced at Beloit is
skeeing. They are long ash planks, carefully and turned up at the end, and are warranted to take
down hill quicker than a wink. After some practice performers become very expert, and the speed with
which they go is something surprising. [Beloit College, Wisconsin, Round Table, Dec. 18, 1885]


warrant (v.)

late 13c., to keep safe from danger, from Old North French warantir safeguard, protect; guarantee,
pledge (Old French garantir), from warant (see warrant (n.)). Meaning to guarantee to be of quality
is attested from late 14c.; sense of to guarantee as true is recorded from c.1300. Related:
Warranted; warranting; warrantable.


presumption (n.)

mid-13c., seizure and occupation without right, also taking upon oneself more than is warranted,
from Old French presumcion (12c., Modern French pr&#233;somption) and directly from Late Latin
praesumptionem (nominative praesumptio) confidence, audacity, in classical Latin, a taking for
granted, anticipation, noun of action from past participle stem of praesumere to take beforehand,
from prae before (see pre-) + sumere to take (see exempt (adj.)). In English, the meaning the taking
of something for granted is attested from c.1300. Presumptuous preserves the older sense.
