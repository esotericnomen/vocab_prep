opprobrium (n.)

1680s, from Latin opprobrium disgrace, infamy, scandal, dishonor, from opprobare (see opprobrious).


cit (n.)

colloquial shortening of citizen, 1640s; contrasted to a countryman or a gentleman, usually with
some measure of opprobrium (Johnson defines it as A pert low townsman; a pragmatical trader).


hissing (n.)

late 14c., hissyng, of imitative origin (see hiss (v.)), but originally also whistling. In both
senses expressing opprobrium.


bitch (v.)

to complain, attested at least from 1930, perhaps from the sense in bitchy, perhaps influenced by
the verb meaning to bungle, spoil, which is recorded from 1823. But bitched in this sense seems to
echo Middle English bicched cursed, bad, a general term of opprobrium (as in Chaucer's bicched bones
unlucky dice), which despite the hesitation of OED, seems to be a derivative of bitch (n.).


hooligan (n.)

1890s, of unknown origin, first found in British newspaper police-court reports in the summer of
1898, almost certainly from the variant form of the Irish surname Houlihan, which figured as a
characteristic comic Irish name in music hall songs and newspapers of the 1880s and '90s.    As an
inventor and adapter to general purposes of the tools used by navvies and hodmen, Hooligan is an
Irish character who occupies week by week the front of a comic literary journal called Nuggets, one
of the series of papers published by Mr. James Henderson at Red Lion House. Previous to publication
in London, Hooligan appears, I believe, in New York in a comic weekly, and in London he is set off
against Schneider, a German, whose contrainventions and adaptations appear in the Garland (a very
similar paper to Nuggets), which also comes from Mr. Henderson's office. Hooligan and Schneider have
been running, I should think, for four or five years. [Notes and Queries, Oct. 15, 1898]
Internationalized 20c. in communist rhetoric as Russian khuligan, opprobrium for scofflaws,
political dissenters, etc.
