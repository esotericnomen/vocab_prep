torso (n.)

1797, from Italian torso trunk of a statue, originally stalk, stump, from Vulgar Latin *tursus, from
Latin thyrsus stalk, stem, from Greek thyrsos (see thyrsus).


bodice (n.)

1560s, oddly spelled plural of body, name of a tight-fitting Elizabethan garment covering the torso;

romance novel is from 1981.


rump (n.)

hind-quarters, buttocks of an animal, mid-15c., from a Scandinavian source (compare Danish,
Norwegian rumpe, Swedish rumpa), from or corresponding to Middle Dutch romp, German Rumpf trunk,
torso. Sense of small remnant derives from tail and is first recorded 1640s in reference to the
English Rump Parliament (December 1648-April 1653). As an adjective from c.1600.


trunk (n.1)

mid-15c., box, case, from Old French tronc alms box in a church, also trunk of a tree, trunk of the
human body, wooden block (12c.), from Latin truncus trunk of a tree, trunk of the body, of uncertain
origin, perhaps originally mutilated, cut off. The meaning box, case is likely to be from the notion
of the body as the case of the organs. English acquired the main stem of a tree and torso of the
body senses from Old French in late 15c. The sense of luggage compartment of a motor vehicle is from
1930. Railroad trunk line is attested from 1843; telephone version is from 1889.


bust (n.1)

1690s, sculpture of upper torso and head, from French buste (16c.), from Italian busto upper body,
from Latin bustum funeral monument, tomb, originally funeral pyre, place where corpses are burned,
perhaps shortened from ambustum, neuter of ambustus burned around, past participle of amburere burn
around, scorch, from ambi- around + urere to burn. Or perhaps from Old Latin boro, the early form of
classical Latin uro to burn. Sense development in Italian is probably from Etruscan custom of
keeping dead person's ashes in an urn shaped like the person when alive. Meaning bosom is by 1884.
