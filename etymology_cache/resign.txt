resignation (n.)

late 14c., act of resigning (an office, etc.), from Old French resignation (14c.) and directly from
Medieval Latin resignationem (nominative resignatio), noun of action from past participle stem of
Latin resignare (see resign). Meaning submission, acquiescence is from 1640s.


resign (v.)

late 14c., give up, surrender, abandon, submit; relinquish, from Old French resigner renounce,
relinquish (13c.), from Latin resignare to check off, annul, cancel, give back, give up, from re-
opposite (see re-) + signare to make an entry in an account book, literally to mark (see sign (v.)).
The sense is of making an entry (signum) opposite -- on the credit side -- balancing the former mark
and thus canceling the claim it represents. The specific meaning of give up a position is first
recorded late 14c. Sense of to give (oneself) up to some emotion or situation is from 1718. Related:

despondence (n.)

1670s, from Latin despondere to give up, lose, lose heart, resign, to promise in marriage
(especially in phrase animam despondere, literally give up one's soul), from the sense of a promise
to give something away, from de- away (see de-) + spondere to promise (see spondee). A condition
more severe than despair.
