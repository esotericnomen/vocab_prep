mutt (n.)

1901, stupid or foolish person, probably a shortening of muttonhead (1803) in the same sense; see
mutton and compare meathead, etc. Mutt was used by 1898 of a dog, especially a stupid one, and
perhaps this is the same word formed independently (muttonhead also was used of stupid animals), or
else a separate word of unknown derivation. Wright's English Dialect Dictionary (1900) has Mutton!
used in scolding a dog, prob. in allusion to the offence of sheep-worrying.    That dog ain't no
mutt, McManus would say as he stood behind the bar opening oysters; no an he ain't no rube! Say!
he's in it all the time when Charley trims the steaks. [Robert W. Chambers, The Haunts of Men, 1898]
Used by 1910 in dog fancier publications to refer to a non-purebred animal.
