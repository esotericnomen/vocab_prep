adamant (adj.)

late 14c., hard, unbreakable, from adamant (n.). Figurative sense of unshakeable first recorded
1670s. Related: Adamantly; adamance.


adamant (n.)

mid-14c., from Old French adamant and directly from Latin adamantem (nominative adamas) adamant,
hardest iron, steel, also figuratively, of character, from Greek adamas (genitive adamantos)
unbreakable, inflexible metaphoric of anything unalterable, also the name of a hypothetical hardest
material, perhaps literally invincible, from a- not + daman to conquer, to tame (see tame (adj.)),
or else a word of foreign origin altered to conform to Greek.    Applied in antiquity to a metal
resembling gold (Plato), white sapphire, magnet (by Ovid, perhaps via confusion with Latin adamare
to love passionately), steel, emery stone, and especially diamond (see diamond). The name has thus
always been of indefinite and fluctuating sense [Century Dictionary]. The word was in Old English as
a&eth;amans a very hard stone.


adamantine (adj.)

c.1200, from Latin adamantinus hard as steel, inflexible, from Greek adamantinos, from adamas (see
adamant (n.)).


diamond (n.)

early 14c., from Old French diamant, from Medieval Latin diamantem (nominative diamas), from Vulgar
Latin *adiamantem (altered by influence of the many Greek words in dia-), from Latin adamantem
(nominative adamans) the hardest metal, later, diamond (see adamant). Playing card suit is from
1590s; Sense in baseball is American English, 1875.
