skimp (v.)

1879, probably a back-formation of skimpy. Related: Skimped; skimping.


skimpy (adj.)

1842, from skimp (adj.) scanty (1775), which perhaps ultimately is from an early 18c. alteration of
scrimp or a variant of scamp (v.). Related: Skimpiness.


scamp (v.)

do in a hasty manner, 1837, perhaps from a Scandinavian source (compare Old Norse skemma to shorten,
make shorter, from skammr short; brief; lately), or a blend of scant and skimp [Klein], or a back-
formation from scamper. Related: Scamped; scamping.
