malinger (v.)

1820, from French malingrer to suffer, perhaps also pretend to be ill, from malingre ailing, sickly
(13c.), of uncertain origin, possibly a blend of mingre sickly, miserable and malade ill. Mingre is
itself a blend of maigre meager + haingre sick, haggard, possibly from Germanic (compare Middle High
German hager thin). The sense evolution may be through notion of beggars with sham sores. Related:
Malingered; malingering; malingerer (1785).


skulk (v.)

c.1200, from a Scandinavian source such as Norwegian skulke to shirk, malinger, Danish skulke to
spare oneself, shirk, Swedish skolka to shirk, skulk, slink, play truant. Common in Middle English
but lacking in 15c.-16c. records; possibly reborrowed 17c. Related: Skulked; skulking; skulker;
skulkery.
