1843, earlier buggybow (1740), probably an alteration of <a

href=/index.php?term=bug&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>bug</a> (n.)), but connected by
Chapman [Dictionary of American Slang] with Bugibu, demon in the Old French poem Aliscans from 1141,
which is perhaps of Celtic origin (compare Cornish bucca-boo, from bucca bogle, goblin).
