bugaboo (n.)

1843, earlier buggybow (1740), probably an alteration of bugbear (also see bug (n.)), but connected
by Chapman [Dictionary of American Slang] with Bugibu, demon in the Old French poem Aliscans from
1141, which is perhaps of Celtic origin (compare Cornish bucca-boo, from bucca bogle, goblin).
