province (n.)

early 14c., country, territory, region, from Old French province province, part of a country;
administrative region for friars (13c.) and directly from Latin provincia territory outside Italy
under Roman domination, also a public office; public duty, of uncertain origin, usually explained as
pro- before + vincere to conquer (see victor); but this does not suit the earliest Latin usages.

bag (n.)

c.1200, bagge, from Old Norse baggi or a similar Scandinavian source; not found in other Germanic
languages, perhaps ultimately of Celtic origin. Disparaging slang for woman dates from 1924 (though
various specialized senses of this are much older). Meaning person's area of interest or expertise
is 1964, from Black English slang, from jazz sense of category, probably via notion of putting
something in a bag.    To be left holding the bag (and presumably nothing else), cheated, swindled
is attested by 1793. Many figurative senses, such as the verb meaning to kill game (1814) and its
colloquial extension to catch, seize, steal (1818) are from the notion of the game bag (late 15c.)
into which the product of the hunt was placed. To let the cat out of the bag reveal the secret is
from 1760.
