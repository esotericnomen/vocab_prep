gnarled (adj.)

the source of the group of words that includes gnarl (v.), gnarl (n.), gnarly is Shakespeare's use
of gnarled in 1603:  <blockquote>  Thy sharpe and sulpherous bolt Splits the vn-wedgable and gnarled
Oke. [Measure for Measure, II.ii.116]  </blockquote>  OED and Barnhart call it a variant of knurled,
from Middle English knar knot in wood (late 14c.), originally a rock, a stone; of uncertain origin.
(Gnarled) occurs in one passage of Shakes. (for which the sole authority is the folio of 1623),
whence it came into general use in the nineteenth century [OED].
