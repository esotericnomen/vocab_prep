mausoleum (n.)

magnificent tomb, 1540s, from Latin mausoleum, from Greek Mausoleion, name of the massive marble
tomb built 353 B.C.E. at Halicarnassus (Greek city in Asia Minor) for Mausolos, Persian satrap who
made himself king of Caria. It was built by his wife (and sister), Artemisia. Counted among the
Seven Wonders of the ancient world, it was destroyed by an earthquake in the Middle Ages. General
sense of any stately burial-place is from c.1600.


Taj Mahal (n.)

mausoleum at Agra, India, built by Shah Jahan for his favorite wife, from Persian, perhaps the best
of buildings, with second element related to Arabic halla to lodge. But some authorities hold that
the name of the mausoleum is a corruption of the name of the woman interred in it, Mumtaz (in
Persian, literally chosen one) Mahal, who died in 1631. Persian taj is literally crown, diadem,
ornamental headdress, but here denoting an object of distinguished excellence. Figurative use of Taj
Mahal in English as a name denoting anything surpassing or excellent is attested from 1895.
