absolution (n.)

remission, forgiveness, c.1200, from Old French absolucion, earlier assolucion, from Latin
absolutionem (nominative absolutio) completion, acquittal, noun of action from past participle stem
of absolvere to absolve (see absolve). Originally of sins; in general use from c.1400.


absolute (adj.)

late 14c., unrestricted; complete, perfect; also not relative to something else (mid-15c.), from
Middle French absolut (14c., Old French asolu, Modern French absolu), from Latin absolutus, past
participle of absolvere to set free, make separate (see absolve).    Most of the current senses also
were in the Latin word. Sense evolution was detached, disengaged, thus perfect, pure. Meaning
despotic (1610s) is from notion of absolute in position. Absolute monarchy is recorded from 1735
(absolute king is recorded from 1610s); scientific absolute magnitude (1902), absolute value (1907)
are from early 20c. In metaphysics, the absolute that which is absolute is from 1809.
