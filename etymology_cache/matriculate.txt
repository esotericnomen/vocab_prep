1570s, to admit a student to a college by enrolling his name on the register, from Late Latin
matriculatus, past participle of matriculare to register, from Latin matricula public register,
diminutive of matrix (genitive matricis) list, roll, also sources, womb (see <a
href=/index.php?term=matrix&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>matrix</a>).  <br /><br />
The connection of senses in the Latin word seems to be via confusion of Greek metra womb (from meter
mother; see <a href=/index.php?term=mother&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>mother</a>
(n.1)) and an identical but different Greek word metra meaning register, lot (see <a
href=/index.php?term=meter&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>meter</a> (n.2)). Evidently
Latin matrix was used to translate both, though it originally shared meaning with only one. Related:
Matriculated; matriculating.
