googol (n.)

1940, in Mathematics and the Imagination, a layman's book on mathematics written by U.S.
mathematicians Edward Kasner (1878-1955) and James R. Newman, the word supposedly coined a year or
two before by Kasner's 9- (or 8-) year-old nephew (unnamed in the book's account of the event), when
asked for a name for an enormous number. Perhaps influenced by comic strip character Barney Google.
Googolplex coined at the same time, in the same way.
