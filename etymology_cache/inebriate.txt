inebriated (adj.)

drunken, c.1600, past participle adjective from inebriate.


inebriate (v.)

late 15c., from Latin inebriatus, past participle of inebriare to make drunk, from in- in (see in-
(2)) + ebriare make drunk, from ebrius drunk, of unknown origin. Related: Inebriated; inebriating.
Also inebriacy; inebriant (n. and adj.); inebriety; and inebrious.


inebriation (n.)

1520s, from Late Latin inebriationem (nominative inebriatio), noun of action from past participle
stem of inebriare (see inebriate).


katzenjammer (n.)

1849, a hangover, American English colloquial, from German katzen, comb. form of katze cat (see cat
(n.)) + jammer distress, wailing (see yammer). Hence, any unpleasant reaction (1897).    Pleasure
can intoxicate, passion can inebriate, success can make you quite as drunk as champagne. The waking
from these several stages of delights will bring the same result--Katzenjammer. In English you would
call it reaction; but whole pages of English cannot express the sick, empty, weary, vacant feeling
which is so concisely contained within these four German syllables. [Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine,
August 1884]   Katzenjammer Kids spectacularly naughty children is from title of comic strip first
drawn by German-born U.S. comic strip artist Rudolph Dirks (1877-1968) in 1897 for the New York
Journal. It was temporarily de-Germanized during World War I:    THE SHENANIGAN KIDS is the new
American name for the original Katzenjammer Kids. Although the original name and idea were pure
Holland Dutch, some people may have had the mistaken impression that they were of Germanic origin,
and hence the change. It is the same splendid comic as in the past. [International Feature Service
