gloomy, morose, sluggish, grave, mid-15c., literally born under the influence of the planet Saturn,
from Middle English Saturne (see <a href=/index.php?term=Saturn&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>Saturn</a>) + <a href=/index.php?term=-ine&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>-ine</a> (1). Medieval physiology believed these characteristics to be caused
by the astrological influence of the planet Saturn, which was the most remote from the Sun (in the
limited knowledge of the times) and thus coldest and slowest in its revolution.
