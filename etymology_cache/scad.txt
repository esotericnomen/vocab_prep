scad (n.)

c.1600, Cornish name for a type of fish (also known as horse mackerel) abundant on the British
coast; of uncertain origin, perhaps a variant of shad. OED compares Welsh ysgaden herrings,
Norwegian dialectal skad, Swedish sk&#228;dde flounder.


scads (n.)

large amounts, 1869, American English, earlier dollar (1855, usually in plural), of uncertain
origin. Unknown connection to scad, the fish, which were often very abundant and occasionally seen
in enormous shoals:    In July, 1834, as Mr. Yarrell informs us, most extraordinary shoals passed up
the channel along the coast of Glamorganshire; their passage occupied a week, and they were
evidently in pursuit of the fry of the herring. The water appeared one dark mass of fish, and they
were caught by cart-loads, and might even be baled out of the water by the hands alone. [British
Fish and Fisheries, 1849]
