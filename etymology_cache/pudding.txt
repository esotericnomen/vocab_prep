pudding (n.)

c.1300, a kind of sausage: the stomach or one of the entrails of a pig, sheep, etc., stuffed with
minced meat, suet, seasoning, boiled and kept till needed, perhaps from a West Germanic stem *pud-
to swell (cognates: Old English puduc a wen, Westphalian dialect puddek lump, pudding, Low German
pudde-wurst black pudding, English dialectal pod belly; also see pudgy).    Other possibility is the
traditional one that it is from Old French boudin sausage, from Vulgar Latin *botellinus, from Latin
botellus sausage (change of French b- to English p- presents difficulties, but compare purse (n.)).
The modern sense had emerged by 1670, from extension to other foods boiled or steamed in a bag or
sack (16c.). German pudding, French pouding, Swedish pudding, Irish putog are from English. Pudding-
pie attested from 1590s.
