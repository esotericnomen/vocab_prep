c.1300, a kind of sausage: the stomach or one of the entrails of a pig, sheep, etc., stuffed with
minced meat, suet, seasoning, boiled and kept till needed, perhaps from a West Germanic stem *pud-
to swell (cognates: Old English puduc a wen, Westphalian dialect puddek lump, pudding, Low German
pudde-wurst black pudding, English dialectal pod belly; also see <a

Other possibility is the traditional one that it is from Old French boudin sausage, from Vulgar
Latin *botellinus, from Latin botellus sausage (change of French b- to English p- presents
difficulties, but compare <a href=/index.php?term=purse&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>purse</a> (n.)). The modern sense had emerged by 1670, from extension to other
foods boiled or steamed in a bag or sack (16c.). German pudding, French pouding, Swedish pudding,
Irish putog are from English. Pudding-pie attested from 1590s.
