mid-13c., from Old French coveitos (12c., Modern French convoiteux) desirous, covetous, from Vulgar
Latin *cupiditosus, from Latin cupiditas (see covet). Related: Covetously; covetousness.


fresh (adj.2)

impudent, presumptuous, 1848, U.S. slang, probably from German frech insolent, cheeky, from Old High
German freh covetous, related to Old English frec greedy, bold (see freak (n.)).


avaricious (adj.)

late 15c., from Old French avaricios greedy, covetous (Modern French avaricieux), from avarice (see
avarice). An Old English word for it was feoh-georn. Related: Avariciously; avariciousness.


lackey (n.)

1520s, footman, running footman, valet, from Middle French laquais foot soldier, footman, servant
(15c.), of unknown origin; perhaps from Old Proven&ccedil;al lacai, from lecai glutton, covetous,
from lecar to lick. Alternative etymology is via French from Catalan alacay, from Arabic al-qadi the
judge. Yet another guess traces it through Spanish lacayo, from Italian lacch&egrave;, from Modern
Greek oulakes, from Turkish ulak runner, courier. This suits the original sense better, but OED says
Italian lacch&egrave; is from French. Sense of servile follower appeared 1580s. As a political term
of abuse it dates from 1939 in communist jargon.


greedy (adj.)

Old English gr&aelig;dig (West Saxon), gredig (Anglian) voracious, also covetous, from Proto-
Germanic *gr&aelig;dagaz (cognates: Old Saxon gradag greedy, Old Norse gra&eth;r greed, hunger,
Danish graadig, Dutch gretig, Old High German gratag greedy, Gothic gredags hungry), from
*gr&aelig;duz (cognates: Gothic gredus hunger, Old English gr&aelig;dum eagerly), possibly from PIE
root *gher- to like, want (source of Sanskrit grdh to be greedy).    In Greek, the word was
philargyros, literally money-loving. A German word for it is habs&uuml;chtig, from haben to have +
sucht sickness, disease, with sense tending toward passion for.
