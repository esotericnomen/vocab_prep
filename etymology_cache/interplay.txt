interplay (n.)

1862, from inter- + play. Reciprocal play, thus free interaction.


feminine (adj.)

mid-14c., of the female sex, from Old French femenin (12c.) feminine, female; with feminine
qualities, effeminate, from Latin femininus feminine (in the grammatical sense at first), from
femina woman, female, literally she who suckles, from root of felare to suck, suckle (see fecund).
Sense of woman-like, proper to or characteristic of women is recorded from mid-15c.    The interplay
of meanings now represented in female, feminine, and effeminate, and the attempt to make them clear
and separate, has led to many coinages: feminitude (1878); feminile feminine (1640s); feminility
womanliness (1838); femality (17c., effeminacy; 1754 female nature). Also feminality (1640s, quality
or state of being female), from rare adjective feminal (late 14c.), from Old French feminal. And
femineity quality or state of being feminine, from Latin femineus of a woman, pertaining to a woman.
