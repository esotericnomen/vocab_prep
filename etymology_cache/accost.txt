accost (v.)

1570s, from Middle French accoster move up to, from Italian accostare or directly from Late Latin
accostare come up to the side, from Latin ad- to (see ad-) + costa rib, side (see coast (n.)). The
original notion is of fleets of warships attacking an enemy's coast. Related: Accosted; accosting.


appeal (v.)

early 14c., originally in legal sense of to call to a higher judge or court, from Anglo-French
apeler to call upon, accuse, Old French apeler make an appeal (11c., Modern French appeler), from
Latin appellare to accost, address, appeal to, summon, name, iterative of appellere to prepare, from
ad- to (see ad-) + pellere to beat, drive (see pulse (n.1)). Related: Appealed; appealing.
Probably a Roman metaphoric extension of a nautical term for driving a ship toward a particular
landing. Popular modern meaning to be attractive or pleasing is quite recent, attested from 1907
(appealing in this sense is from 1891), from the notion of to address oneself in expectation of a
sympathetic response.


greet (v.)

Old English gretan to come in contact with (in sense of attack, accost as well as salute, welcome,
and touch, take hold of, handle), from West Germanic *grotjan (cognates: Old Saxon grotian, Old
Frisian greta, Dutch groeten, Old High German gruozen, German gr&uuml;&szlig;en to salute, greet),
perhaps originally to resound (via notion of cause to speak), causative of Proto-Germanic
*gr&aelig;tanan, root of Old English gr&aelig;tan (Anglian gretan) weep, bewail, from PIE *gher- (2)
to call out. Greet still can mean cry, weep in Scottish &amp; northern England dialect, though this
might be from a different root. Gr&aelig;tan is probably also the source of the second element in
regret. Related: Greeted; greeting.
