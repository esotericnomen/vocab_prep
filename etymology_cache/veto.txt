pocket (adj.)

1610s, of or pertaining to or meant for a pocket, from pocket (n.). Pocket-knife is first recorded
1727; pocket-money is attested from 1630s. Often merely implying a small-sized version of something
(for example of of warships, from 1930; also compare Pocket Venus beautiful, small woman, attested
from 1808). Pocket veto attested from 1842, American English.    The pocket veto can operate only in
the case of bills sent to the President within ten days of Congressional adjournment. If he retain
such a bill (figuratively, in his pocket) neither giving it his sanction by signing it, nor
withholding his sanction in returning it to Congress, the bill is defeated. The President is not
bound to give reasons for defeating a bill by a pocket veto which he has not had at least ten days
to consider. In a regular veto he is bound to give such reasons. [James Albert Woodburn, The
American Republic and its Government, Putnam's, 1903]
