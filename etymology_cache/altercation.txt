altercation (n.)

late 14c., from Old French altercacion (12c.) and directly from Latin altercationem (nominative
altercatio) a dispute, debate, discussion, noun of action from past participle stem of altercari to
dispute (with another), from alter other (see alter).


altercate (v.)

1520s, to contend with words, from Latin altercatus, past participle of altercari (see altercation).


word (n.)

Old English word speech, talk, utterance, sentence, statement, news, report, word, from Proto-
Germanic *wurdan (cognates: Old Saxon, Old Frisian word, Dutch woord, Old High German, German wort,
Old Norse or&eth;, Gothic waurd), from PIE *were- (3) speak, say (see verb).    The meaning promise
was in Old English, as was the theological sense. In the plural, the meaning verbal altercation (as
in to have words with someone) dates from mid-15c. Word processor first recorded 1971; word
processing is from 1972; word wrap is from 1977. A word to the wise is from Latin phrase verbum
sapienti satis est a word to the wise is enough. Word-for-word is late 14c. Word of mouth is
recorded from 1550s.    It is dangerous to leave written that which is badly written. A chance word,
upon paper, may destroy the world. Watch carefully and erase, while the power is still yours, I say
to myself, for all that is put down, once it escapes, may rot its way into a thousand minds, the
corn become a black smut, and all libraries, of necessity, be burned to the ground as a consequence.
[William Carlos Williams, Paterson]
