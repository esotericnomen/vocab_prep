Geronimo

cry made in jumping, apparently from the story of the Apache leader Geronimo making a daring leap to
escape U.S. cavalry pursuers at Medicine Bluffs, Oklahoma (and supposedly shouting his name in
defiance as he did). Adopted as battle cry by 82nd Airborne U.S. paratroopers in World War II, who
perhaps had seen it in the 1939 Paramount Studios movie Geronimo. The name is the Italian and
Spanish form of Jerome, from Greek Hieronomos, literally sacred name.


aristocracy (n.)

1560s, from Middle French aristocracie (Modern French aristocratie), from Late Latin aristocratia,
from Greek aristokratia government or rule of the best, from aristos best (originally most fitting,
from PIE *ar-isto-, superlative form of *ar- to fit together; see arm (n.1)) + kratos rule, power
(see -cracy).    At first in a literal sense of government by those who are the best citizens;
meaning rule by a privileged class (best-born or best-favored by fortune) is from 1570s and became
paramount 17c. Hence, the meaning patrician order (1650s). In early use contrasted with monarchy;
after French and American revolutions, with democracy.
