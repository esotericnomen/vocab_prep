escapade (n.)

1650s, an escape from confinement, from French escapade (16c.) a prank or trick, from Spanish
escapada a prank, flight, an escape, noun use of fem. past participle of escapar to escape, from
Vulgar Latin *excappare (see escape). Or perhaps the French word is via Italian scappata, from
scappare, from the same Vulgar Latin source. Figurative sense (1814) is of breaking loose from rules
or restraints on behavior.
