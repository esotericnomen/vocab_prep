1650s, an escape from confinement, from French escapade (16c.) a prank or trick, from Spanish
escapada a prank, flight, an escape, noun use of fem. past participle of escapar to escape, from
Vulgar Latin *excappare (see <a href=/index.php?term=escape&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>escape</a>). Or perhaps the French word is via Italian scappata, from scappare,
from the same Vulgar Latin source. Figurative sense (1814) is of breaking loose from rules or
restraints on behavior.
