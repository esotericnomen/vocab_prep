cloud of bees or other insects, Old English swearm swarm, multitude, from Proto-Germanic *swarmaz
(cognates: Old Saxon, Middle Low German swarm, Danish sv&#230;rm a swarm, Swedish sv&auml;rm, Middle
Dutch swerm, Old High German swaram, German Schwarm swarm; Old Norse svarmr tumult), by Watkins,
etc., derived from PIE imitative root *swer- (2) to buzz, whisper (see <a
href=/index.php?term=susurration&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>susurration</a>) on
notion of humming sound, and thus probably originally of bees. But OED suggests possible connection
with base of <a href=/index.php?term=swerve&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>swerve</a>
and ground sense of agitated, confused, or deflected motion. General sense large, dense throng is
from early 15c.
