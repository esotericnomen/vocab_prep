gavel (n.)

small mallet used by presiding officers at meetings, 1805, American English, of unknown origin;
perhaps connected with German dialectal gaffel brotherhood, friendly society, from Middle High
German gaffel society, guild, related to Old English gafol tribute, giefan to give (see habit). But
in some sources gavel also is identified as a type of mason's tool, in which case the extended
meaning may be via freemasonry. As a verb, by 1887, from the noun. Old English had tabule wooden
hammer struck as a signal for assembly among monks, an extended sense of table (n.).
