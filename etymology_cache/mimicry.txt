ape (n.)

Old English apa ape, monkey, from Proto-Germanic *apan (cognates: Old Saxon apo, Old Norse api,
Dutch aap, German affe), perhaps borrowed in Proto-Germanic from Celtic (compare Old Irish apa) or
Slavic (compare Old Bohemian op, Slovak opitza), perhaps ultimately from a non-Indo-European
language.    Apes were noted in medieval times for mimicry of human action, hence, perhaps, the
other figurative use of the word, to mean a fool. To go ape (in emphatic form, go apeshit) go crazy
is 1955, U.S. slang. To lead apes in hell (1570s) was the fancied fate of one who died an old maid.
