early 14c., evening signal, ringing of a bell at a fixed hour, from Anglo-French coeverfu (late
13c.), from Old French cuevrefeu, literally cover fire (Modern French couvre-few), from cuevre,
imperative of covrir to cover (see <a href=/index.php?term=cover&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>cover</a> (v.)) + feu fire (see <a
href=/index.php?term=focus&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>focus</a> (n.)). The medieval
practice of ringing a bell at fixed time in the evening as an order to bank the hearths and prepare
for sleep. The original purpose was to prevent conflagrations from untended fires. The modern
extended sense of periodic restriction of movement had evolved by 1800s.
