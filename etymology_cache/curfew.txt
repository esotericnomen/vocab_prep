curfew (n.)

early 14c., evening signal, ringing of a bell at a fixed hour, from Anglo-French coeverfu (late
13c.), from Old French cuevrefeu, literally cover fire (Modern French couvre-few), from cuevre,
imperative of covrir to cover (see cover (v.)) + feu fire (see focus (n.)). The medieval practice of
ringing a bell at fixed time in the evening as an order to bank the hearths and prepare for sleep.
The original purpose was to prevent conflagrations from untended fires. The modern extended sense of
periodic restriction of movement had evolved by 1800s.
