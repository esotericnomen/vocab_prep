semi-detached (adj.)

in reference to houses, 1845, from semi- + past participle of detach (v.).  <blockquote>  The
Detached House bears its peculiar characteristic on its front; it stands alone, and nothing more can
be said about it; but with the semi-detached house there is a subtle mystery, much to be marvelled
at. Semi-detached! Have the party-walls between two houses shrunk, or is there a bridge connecting
the two, as in Mr. Beckford's house in Landsdown Crescent, Bath? A semi-detached house may be a
house with a field on one side and a bone-boiling factory on the other. Semi-detached may mean half-
tumbling to pieces. I must inquire into it. [Houses to Let, in Household Words, March 20, 1852]
