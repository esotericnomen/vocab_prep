in reference to houses, 1845, from <a href=/index.php?term=semi-&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>semi-</a> + past participle of <a
href=/index.php?term=detach&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>detach</a> (v.).
<blockquote>  The Detached House bears its peculiar characteristic on its front; it stands alone,
and nothing more can be said about it; but with the semi-detached house there is a subtle mystery,
much to be marvelled at. Semi-detached! Have the party-walls between two houses shrunk, or is there
a bridge connecting the two, as in Mr. Beckford's house in Landsdown Crescent, Bath? A semi-detached
house may be a house with a field on one side and a bone-boiling factory on the other. Semi-detached
may mean half-tumbling to pieces. I must inquire into it. [Houses to Let, in Household Words, March
20, 1852]  </blockquote>
