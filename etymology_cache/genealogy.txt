folklore (n.)

folclar meant homily.    This word revived folk in a modern sense of of the common people, whose
culture is handed down orally, and opened up a flood of compound formations, as in folk art (1892),
folk-hero (1874), folk-medicine (1877), folk-tale/folk tale (1850; Old English folctalu meant
genealogy), folk-song (1847), folk singer (1876), folk-dance (1877).
