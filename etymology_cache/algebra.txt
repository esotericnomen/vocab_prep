algebra (n.)

1550s, from Medieval Latin algebra, from Arabic al jabr (in vulgar pronunciation, al-jebr [Klein])
reunion of broken parts, as in computation, used 9c. by Baghdad mathematician Abu Ja'far Muhammad
ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi as the title of his famous treatise on equations (Kitab al-Jabr w'al-Muqabala
Rules of Reintegration and Reduction), which also introduced Arabic numerals to the West. The accent
shifted 17c. from second syllable to first. The word was used in English 15c.-16c. to mean bone-
setting, probably from Arab medical men in Spain.


algebraic (adj.)

1660s, from algebra + -ic. Earlier was algebraical (1570s).


exponent (n.)

1706, from Latin exponentem (nominative exponens), present participle of exponere put forth (see
expound). Earliest use is the mathematical one (said to have been introduced in algebra by
Descartes) for the symbol to indicate by what power the base number is to be raised. The sense of
one who expounds is 1812. As an adjective, from 1580s.


algorithm (n.)

1690s, from French algorithme, refashioned (under mistaken connection with Greek arithmos number)
from Old French algorisme the Arabic numeral system (13c.), from Medieval Latin algorismus, a
mangled transliteration of Arabic al-Khwarizmi native of Khwarazm, surname of the mathematician
whose works introduced sophisticated mathematics to the West (see algebra). The earlier form in
Middle English was algorism (early 13c.), from Old French.
