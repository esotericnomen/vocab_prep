glorious (adj.)

late 13c., from Anglo-French glorious, Old French glorieus (12c., Modern French glorieux), from
Latin gloriosus full of glory, famous, from gloria (see glory). In 14c.-17c. it also could mean

peacock (n.)

c.1300, poucock, from Middle English po peacock + coc (see cock (n.)).   Po is from Old English pawa
peafowl (cock or hen), from Latin pavo (genitive pavonis), which, with Greek taos said to be
ultimately from Tamil tokei (but perhaps is imitative; Latin represented the peacock's sound as
paupulo).    The Latin word also is the source of Old High German pfawo, German Pfau, Dutch pauw,
Old Church Slavonic pavu. Used as the type of a vainglorious person from late 14c. Its flesh
superstitiously was believed to be incorruptible (even St. Augustine credits this). When he sees his
feet, he screams wildly, thinking that they are not in keeping with the rest of his body.
[Epiphanus]
