1771, collective name for animals of a certain region or time, from Late Latin Fauna, a Roman
fertility goddess, wife, sister, or daughter (or some combination thereof) of Faunus (see <a

Popularized by Linnaeus, who adopted it as a companion word to <a

title of his 1746 catalogue of the animals of Sweden, Fauna Suecica. First used in English by
naturalist Gilbert White.
