fauna (n.)

1771, collective name for animals of a certain region or time, from Late Latin Fauna, a Roman
fertility goddess, wife, sister, or daughter (or some combination thereof) of Faunus (see faun).
Popularized by Linnaeus, who adopted it as a companion word to flora and used it in the title of his
1746 catalogue of the animals of Sweden, Fauna Suecica. First used in English by naturalist Gilbert
White.
