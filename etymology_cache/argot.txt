argot (n.)

1860, from French argot (17c.) the jargon of Paris rogues and thieves, earlier the company of
beggars, from Middle French argot, group of beggars, origin unknown. Gamillscheg suggests a
connection to Old French argoter to cut off the stubs left in pruning, with a connecting sense of to
get a grip on. The best English equivalent is perhaps cant. The German equivalent is Rotwelsch,
literally Red Welsh, but the first element may be connected with Middle High German rot beggar.
Earlier in English was pedlar's French (1520s) language of thieves and vagabonds.
