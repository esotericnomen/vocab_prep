1660s as a French word in English; nativized by 1758; from French ennui, from Old French enui
annoyance (13c.), back-formation from enuier (see <a
href=/index.php?term=annoy&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>annoy</a>). Hence
ennuy&eacute; afflicted with ennui; ennuy&eacute;e a woman so afflicted.  <blockquote>  So far as
frequency of use is concerned, the word might be regarded as fully naturalized; but the
pronunciation has not been anglicized, there being in fact no Eng. analogy which could serve as a
guide. [OED]</blockquote>
