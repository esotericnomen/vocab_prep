ennui (n.)

1660s as a French word in English; nativized by 1758; from French ennui, from Old French enui
annoyance (13c.), back-formation from enuier (see annoy). Hence ennuy&eacute; afflicted with ennui;
ennuy&eacute;e a woman so afflicted.    So far as frequency of use is concerned, the
word might be regarded as fully naturalized; but the pronunciation has not been anglicized, there
being in fact no Eng. analogy which could serve as a guide. [OED]
