ennui (n.)

1660s as a French word in English; nativized by 1758; from French ennui, from Old French enui
annoyance (13c.), back-formation from enuier (see annoy). Hence ennuy&eacute; afflicted with ennui;
ennuy&eacute;e a woman so afflicted.    So far as frequency of use is concerned, the word might be
regarded as fully naturalized; but the pronunciation has not been anglicized, there being in fact no
Eng. analogy which could serve as a guide. [OED]


boring (adj.)

mid-15c., action of piercing, from bore (v.). From 1853 in reference to animals that bore; 1840 in
the sense wearying, causing ennui.


bore (n.)

thing which causes ennui or annoyance, 1778; of persons by 1812; from bore (v.1).  The secret of
being a bore is to tell everything. [Voltaire, Sept Discours en Vers sur l'Homme, 1738]
