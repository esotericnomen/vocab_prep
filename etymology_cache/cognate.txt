1640s, from Latin cognatus of common descent, from com- together (see <a
href=/index.php?term=co-&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>co-</a>) + gnatus, past
participle of gnasci, older form of nasci to be born (see <a
href=/index.php?term=genus&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>genus</a>). Words that are
cognates are cousins, not siblings. As a noun, from 1754.
