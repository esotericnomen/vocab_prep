chasm (n.)

1590s, deep crack in the earth, from Latin chasma, from Greek khasma yawning hollow, gulf, related
to khaskein to yawn, and thus to chaos. In English in 17c. often spelled chasma. Figurative use from
1640s. Related: Chasmal; chasmic.


pharynx (n.)

1690s, from Greek pharynx (genitive pharyngos) windpipe, throat, related to pharanx cleft, chasm.


gap (n.)

early 14c. (mid-13c. in place names), from Old Norse gap chasm, related to gapa to gape, from PIE
*ghai- to yawn, gape (see yawn (v.)). Originally hole in a wall or hedge; broader sense is 16c. In
U.S., common in place names in reference to a break or pass in a long mountain chain (especially one
that water flows through). As a verb from 1847.


middlebrow

1911 (adj.), 1912 (n.), from middle + brow (compare highbrow, lowbrow).    [T]here is an alarmingly
wide chasm, I might almost say a vacuum, between the high-brow, who considers reading either as a
trade or as a form of intellectual wrestling, and the low-brow, who is merely seeking for gross
thrills. It is to be hoped that culture will soon be democratized through some less conventional
system of education, giving rise to a new type that might be called the middle-brow, who will
consider books as a source of intellectual enjoyment. [The Nation, Jan, 25, 1912]
