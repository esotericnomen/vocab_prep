forlorn (adj.)

mid-12c., forloren disgraced, depraved, past participle of obsolete forlesan be deprived of, lose,
abandon, from Old English forleosan to lose, abandon, let go; destroy, ruin, from for- completely +
leosan to lose (see lose). In the Mercian hymns, Latin perditionis is glossed by Old English
forlorenisse.    Sense of forsaken, abandoned is 1530s; that of wretched, miserable first recorded
1580s. A common Germanic compound (cognates: Old Saxon farilosan, Old Frisian urliasa, Middle Dutch
verliesen, Dutch verliezen, Old High German virliosan, German verlieren, Gothic fraliusan to lose).
Commonly in forlorn hope (1570s), which is a partial translation of Dutch verloren hoop, in which
hoop means troop, band, literally heap, and the sense of the whole phrase is of a suicide mission.
The phrase is usually used incorrectly in English, and the misuse has colored the sense of forlorn.
