compound (cognates: Old Saxon farilosan, Old Frisian urliasa, Middle Dutch verliesen, Dutch
verliezen, Old High German virliosan, German verlieren, Gothic fraliusan to lose).  <br /><br />
Commonly in forlorn hope (1570s), which is a partial translation of Dutch verloren hoop, in which
hoop means troop, band, literally heap, and the sense of the whole phrase is of a suicide mission.
The phrase is usually used incorrectly in English, and the misuse has colored the sense of forlorn.
