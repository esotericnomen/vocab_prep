jejune (adj.)

1610s, dull in the mind, flat, insipid, from Latin ieiunus empty, dry, barren, literally fasting,
hungry, of obscure origin.


jejunum (n.)

late 14c., from Latin ieiunum, neuter of ieiunus (see jejune). Translating Greek nestis (Galen). So
called because it typically is found empty during dissections, perhaps because it would tend to
drain in a body laid on its back.


dine (v.)

late 13c., from Old French disner (Modern French d&icirc;ner) to dine, eat, have a meal, originally
take the first meal of the day, from stem of Gallo-Roman *desjunare to break one's fast, from Vulgar
Latin *disjejunare, from dis- undo (see dis-) + Late Latin jejunare to fast, from Latin iejunus
fasting, hungry (see jejune).


breakfast (n.)

mid-15c., from break (v.) + fast (n.). An Old English word for it was undernmete (see undern), also
morgenmete morning meal.. The verb is recorded from 1670s. Related: Breakfasted; breakfasting.
Spanish almuerzo lunch, but formerly and still locally breakfast, is from Latin admorsus, past
participle of admordere to bite into, from ad- to + mordere to bite. In common with almuerzo, words
for breakfast tend over time to shift in meaning toward lunch; compare French d&eacute;jeuner
breakfast, later lunch (equivalent of Spanish desayuno breakfast), both from Vulgar Latin
*disieiunare to breakfast, from Latin dis- apart, in a different direction from + ieiunare, jejunare
fast (see jejune; also compare dine). German Fr&#252;hst&#252;ck is from Middle High German
vruost&#252;cke, literally early bit.
