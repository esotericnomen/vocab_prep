1911, from German Allergie, coined 1906 by  Austrian pediatrician Clemens E. von Pirquet (1874-1929)

Asperger&#039;s Syndrome (n.)

1981, named for the sake of Austrian pediatrician Hans Asperger (1906-1980), who described it in
1944 (and called it autistic psychopathy; German autistischen psychopathen). A standard diagnosis
since 1992; recognition of Asperger's work was delayed, perhaps, because his school and much of his
early research were destroyed by Allied bombing in 1944.    The example of autism shows particularly
well how even abnormal personalities can be capable of development and adjustment. Possibilities of
social integration which one would never have dremt of may arise in the course of development. [Hans
Asperger, Autistic psychopathy in Childhood, 1944]
