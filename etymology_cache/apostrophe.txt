apostrophe (n.)

mark indicating omitted letter, 1580s, from Middle French apostrophe, from Late Latin apostrophus,
from Greek apostrophos (prosoidia) (the accent of) turning away, thus, a mark showing where a letter
has been omitted, from apostrephein avert, turn away, from apo- from (see apo-) + strephein to turn
(see strophe).    In English, the mark often represents loss of -e- in -es, possessive ending. It
was being extended to all possessives, whether they ever had an -e- or not, by 18c. Greek also used
this word for a turning aside of an orator in speech to address some individual, a sense first
recorded in English 1530s.
