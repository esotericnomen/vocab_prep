imbue (v.)

early 15c., to keep wet; to soak, saturate; also figuratively to cause to absorb (feelings,
opinions, etc.), from Latin imbuere moisten, of uncertain origin, perhaps from the same root as
imbrication. Compare also Old French embu, past participle of emboivre, from Latin imbibere drink
in, soak in (see imbibe), which might have influenced the English word. Related: Imbued; imbuing.


indoctrinate (v.)

1620s, to teach, from in- (2) in + Latin doctrina teaching (see doctrine). Meaning to imbue with an
idea or opinion first recorded 1832. Related: Indoctrinated; indoctrinating. The earlier verb was
indoctrine (c.1500).


taint (v.)

1570s, to corrupt, contaminate, also to touch, tinge, imbue slightly (1590s), from Middle English
teynten to convict, prove guilty (late 14c.), partly from Old French ataint, past participle of
ataindre to touch upon, seize (see attainder). Also from Anglo-French teinter to color, dye (early
15c.), from Old French teint (12c.), past participle of teindre to dye, color, from Latin tingere
(see tincture). Related: Tainted; tainting.
