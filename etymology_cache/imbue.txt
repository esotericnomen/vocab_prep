early 15c., to keep wet; to soak, saturate; also figuratively to cause to absorb (feelings,
opinions, etc.), from Latin imbuere moisten, of uncertain origin, perhaps from the same root as <a

Compare also Old French embu, past participle of emboivre, from Latin imbibere drink in, soak in
(see <a href=/index.php?term=imbibe&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>imbibe</a>), which
might have influenced the English word. Related: Imbued; imbuing.
