imbue (v.)

early 15c., to keep wet; to soak, saturate; also figuratively to cause to absorb (feelings,
opinions, etc.), from Latin imbuere moisten, of uncertain origin, perhaps from the same root as
imbrication. Compare also Old French embu, past participle of emboivre, from Latin imbibere drink
in, soak in (see imbibe), which might have influenced the English word. Related: Imbued; imbuing.
