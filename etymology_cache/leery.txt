leery (adj.)

untrusting, suspicious, alert, 1718, originally slang, with -y (2), and perhaps from dialectal lere
learning, knowledge (see lore), or from leer (v.) in some now-obscure sense. OED suggests connection
with archaic leer (adj.) empty, useless, a general Germanic word (cognate with German leer, Dutch
laar), of unknown origin.
