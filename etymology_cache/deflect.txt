also (and with more etymological propriety) deflexion, c.1600, from Latin deflexionem, noun of
action from past participle stem of deflectere (see <a
href=/index.php?term=deflect&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>deflect</a>). Both forms
were present 17c., but the spelling with -c- has come to predominate.
