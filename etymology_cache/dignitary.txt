dignified (adj.)

past participle adjective from dignify; 1660s in sense ranking as a dignitary; 1812 in sense having
a dignified manner.


personage (n.)

mid-15c., body of a person (with regard to appearance), from Old French personage size, stature,
also a dignitary (13c.), from Medieval Latin personaticum (11c.), from persona (see person). Meaning
a person of high rank or distinction is attested from c.1500 in English; as a longer way to say

is overly self-important).
