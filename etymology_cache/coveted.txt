pippin (n.)

excellent person or thing, 1897, from coveted varieties of apple that were raised from seed (so
called since early 15c.), from Middle English pipin seed (see pip (n.1)).


covet (v.)

mid-13c., from Old French coveitier covet, desire, lust after (12c., Modern French convoiter,
influenced by con- words), probably ultimately from Latin cupiditas passionate desire, eagerness,
ambition, from cupidus very desirous, from cupere long for, desire (see cupidity). Related: Coveted;
coveting.


laugh (v.)

late 14c., from Old English (Anglian) hl&aelig;hhan, earlier hlihhan, from Proto-Germanic *klakhjan
(cognates: Old Norse hl&aelig;ja, Danish le, Old Frisian hlakkia, Old Saxon hlahhian, Middle Dutch
and Dutch lachen, Old High German hlahhan, German lachen, Gothic hlahjan), from PIE *kleg-, of
imitative origin (compare Latin cachinnare to laugh aloud, Sanskrit kakhati laughs, Old Church
Slavonic chochotati laugh, Lithuanian klageti to cackle, Greek kakhazein). Originally with a hard
-gh- sound, as in Scottish loch; the spelling remained after the pronunciation shifted to -f.    If
I coveted nowe to avenge the injuries that you have done me, I myght laughe in my slyve. [John Daus,
Sleidanes Commentaries, 1560]    Related: Laughed; laughing.
