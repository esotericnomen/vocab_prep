mid-14c., from Old French compunction (12c., Modern French componction), from Late Latin
compunctionem (nominative compunctio) remorse; a pricking (of conscience), noun of action from past
participle stem of Latin compungere to severely prick, sting, from com-, intensive prefix (see <a
href=/index.php?term=com-&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>com-</a>), + pungere to prick
(see <a href=/index.php?term=pungent&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>pungent</a>). Used
in figurative sense by early Church writers. Originally a much more intense feeling, similar to
remorse, or contrition.
