black (n.)

Old English bl&aelig;c the color black, also ink, from noun use of black (adj.). From late 14c. as
dark spot in the pupil of the eye. The meaning black person, African is from 1620s (perhaps late
13c., and blackamoor is from 1540s). To be in the black (1922) is from the accounting practice of
recording credits and balances in black ink.    For years it has been a common practice to use red
ink instead of black in showing a loss or deficit on corporate books, but not until the heavy losses
of 1921 did the contrast in colors come to have a widely understood meaning. [Saturday Evening Post,

ellipse (n.)

1753, from French ellipse (17c.), from Latin ellipsis ellipse, also, a falling short, deficit, from
Greek elleipsis (see ellipsis). So called because the conic section of the cutting plane makes a
smaller angle with the base than does the side of the cone, hence, a falling short. The Greek word
was first applied by Apollonius of Perga (3c. B.C.E.). to the curve which previously had been called
the section of the acute-angled cone, but the word earlier had been technically applied to a
rectangle one of whose sides coincides with a part of a given line (Euclid, VI. 27).
