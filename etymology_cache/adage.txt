brief, familiar proverb, 1540s, Middle French adage, from Latin adagium adage, proverb, apparently
from adagio, from ad- to (see <a href=/index.php?term=ad-&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>ad-</a>) + *agi-, root of aio I say, from PIE *ag- to speak. But Tucker thinks
the second element is rather ago set in motion, drive, urge.
