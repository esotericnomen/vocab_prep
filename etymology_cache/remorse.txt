remorse (n.)

late 14c., from Old French remors (Modern French remords), from Medieval Latin remorsum, noun use of
neuter past participle of Latin remordere to vex, disturb, literally to bite back, from re- back
(see re-) + mordere to bite (see mordant).    The sense evolution was via the Medieval Latin phrase
remorsus conscienti&aelig; (translated into Middle English as ayenbite of inwit). Middle English
also had a verb, remord to strike with remorse, touch with compassion, prick one's conscience.
