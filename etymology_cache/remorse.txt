late 14c., from Old French remors (Modern French remords), from Medieval Latin remorsum, noun use of
neuter past participle of Latin remordere to vex, disturb, literally to bite back, from re- back
(see <a href=/index.php?term=re-&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>re-</a>) + mordere to
bite (see <a href=/index.php?term=mordant&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>mordant</a>).
<br /><br />  The sense evolution was via the Medieval Latin phrase remorsus conscienti&aelig;
(translated into Middle English as ayenbite of inwit). Middle English also had a verb, remord to
strike with remorse, touch with compassion, prick one's conscience.
