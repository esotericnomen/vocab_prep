cupidity (n.)

mid-15c., from Anglo-French cupidite, Middle French cupidit&eacute;, from Latin cupiditatem
(nominative cupiditas) passionate desire, lust; ambition, from cupidus eager, passionate, from
cupere to desire (perhaps cognate with Sanskrit kupyati bubbles up, becomes agitated, Old Church
Slavonic kypeti to boil, Lithuanian kupeti to boil over). Despite the primarily erotic sense of the
Latin word, in English cupidity originally, and still especially, means desire for wealth.


concupiscence (n.)

mid-14c., from Latin concupiscentia eager desire, from concupiscens, present participle of
concupiscere, inceptive of concupere to be very desirous of, from com-, intensive prefix (see com-),
+ cupere to long for (see cupidity). Used in Vulgate to translate Greek epithymia.


Cupid

especially of lips, is from 1858.


covet (v.)

mid-13c., from Old French coveitier covet, desire, lust after (12c., Modern French convoiter,
influenced by con- words), probably ultimately from Latin cupiditas passionate desire, eagerness,
ambition, from cupidus very desirous, from cupere long for, desire (see cupidity). Related: Coveted;
