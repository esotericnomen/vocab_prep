1680s (Hakluyt, 1560s, has Malestrand), name of a famous whirlpool off the northwest coast of
Norway, from Danish malstr&oslash;m (1673), from older Dutch Maelstrom (modern maalstroom),
literally grinding-stream, from malen to grind (see <a
href=/index.php?term=meal&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>meal</a>) + stroom stream (see
<a href=/index.php?term=stream&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>stream</a> (n.)). The
name was used by Dutch cartographers (for example Mercator, 1595). OED says perhaps originally from
F&aelig;roic mal(u)streymur. Popularized as a synonym for whirlpool c.1841, the year of Poe's A
Descent into the Maelstrom.
