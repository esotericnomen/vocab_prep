point of the heavens directly overhead at any place, late 14c., from Old French cenith (Modern
French z&eacute;nith), from Medieval Latin cenit, senit, bungled scribal transliterations of Arabic
samt road, path, abbreviation of samt ar-ras, literally the way over the head. Letter -m- misread as
-ni-.  <br /><br />  The Medieval Latin word could as well be influenced by the rough agreement of
the Arabic term with classical Latin semita sidetrack, side path (notion of thing going off to the
side), from se- apart + *mi-ta-, suffixed zero-grade form of PIE root *mei- (1) to change (see <a

sense of highest point or state is from c.1600.
