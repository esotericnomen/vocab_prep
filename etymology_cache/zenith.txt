zenith (n.)

point of the heavens directly overhead at any place, late 14c., from Old French cenith (Modern
French z&eacute;nith), from Medieval Latin cenit, senit, bungled scribal transliterations of Arabic
samt road, path, abbreviation of samt ar-ras, literally the way over the head. Letter -m- misread as
-ni-.    The Medieval Latin word could as well be influenced by the rough agreement of the Arabic
term with classical Latin semita sidetrack, side path (notion of thing going off to the side), from
se- apart + *mi-ta-, suffixed zero-grade form of PIE root *mei- (1) to change (see mutable).
Figurative sense of highest point or state is from c.1600.


azimuth (n.)

distance of a star from the north or south point of the meridian, late 14c., from Old French azimut,
from Arabic as-sumut the ways, plural of as-samt the way, direction (see zenith).


Ascians (n.)

inhabitants of the torrid zone, who haue the Sunne twice euery yeere in their zenith, and then they
make no shaddowes at all [Nathanael Carpenter, Geographie Delineated forth in Two Bookes, 1635],
from Medieval Latin Ascii, from Greek askioi, from a- not, without, privative prefix (see a- (3)), +
skia shade, shadow (see shine (v.)).


Pericles

Athenian statesman (c.495-429 B.C.E.), from Greek Perikles, literally far-famed, from peri all
around (see peri-) + -kles fame (see Damocles). His leadership of Athens marks its intellectual and
material zenith. Related: Periclean.


nadir (n.)

late 14c., in astronomical sense, from Medieval Latin nadir, from Arabic nazir opposite to, in nazir
as-samt, literally opposite direction, from nazir opposite + as-samt road, path (see zenith).
Transferred sense of lowest point (of anything) is first recorded 1793.
