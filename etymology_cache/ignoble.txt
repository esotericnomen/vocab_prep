ignoble (adj.)

mid-15c., of low birth, from Middle French ignoble, from Latin ignobilis unknown, undistinguished,
obscure; of base birth, not noble, from assimilated form of in- not, opposite of (see in- (1)) +
gnobilis well-known, famous, renowned, of superior birth (see noble). Related: Ignobly.


banausic (adj.)

merely mechanical, coined 1845 from Greek banausikos pertaining to mechanics, from banausos artisan,
mere mechanical, hence (to the Greeks) base, ignoble; perhaps literally working by fire, from baunos
furnace, forge (but Klein dismisses this as folk etymology and calls it of uncertain origin).


narrow-minded (adj.)

also narrow minded, 1620s, from narrow (adj.) + minded. Related: Narrow-mindedness. Middle English
had narrow-hearted mean, ungenerous, ignoble (c.1200).
