swamp (n.)

c.1500 (implied in swampwatyr swamp-water), of uncertain origin, perhaps [Barnhart] a dialectal
survival from an Old English cognate of Old Norse sv&ouml;ppr sponge, fungus, from Proto-Germanic
*swampuz; but traditionally connected with Middle English sompe morass, swamp, which probably is
from Middle Dutch somp or Middle Low German sump swamp (see sump). All of these likely are
ultimately related to each other, from PIE *swombho- spongy; mushroom, via the notion of spongy
ground.  <blockquote>  [B]y swamps then in general is to be understood any low grounds subject to
inundations, distinguished from marshes, in having a large growth of timber, and much underwood,
canes, reeds, wythes, vines, briers, and such like, so matted together, that they are in a great
measure impenetrable to man or beast .... [Bernard Romans, A Concise History of East and West
Florida, 1775]   </blockquote>  More popular in U.S. (swamp (n.) by itself is first attested 1624 in
Capt. John Smith's description of Virginia). Swamp-oak is from 1680s, American English. Swamp Yankee
rural, rustic New Englander is attested from 1941. Thornton's American Glossary (1912) has swamp-
angel dweller in a swamp, swamp-law might makes right.
