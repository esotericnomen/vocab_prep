frock (n.)

mid-14c., from Old French froc a monk's habit (12c.), of unknown origin; perhaps from Frankish *hrok
or some other Germanic source (compare Old High German hroc mantle, coat; Old Norse rokkr, Old
English rocc, Old Frisian rokk, German Rock coat), from PIE root *rug- to spin.    Another theory
traces it to Medieval Latin floccus, from Latin floccus flock of wool. Meaning outer garment for
women or children is from 1530s. Frock-coat attested by 1823.
