pied a terre (n.)

small town house or rooms used for short residences, 1829, French, pied &#224; terre, literally foot
on the ground.


pied (adj.)

late 14c., as if it were the past participle of a verb form of Middle English noun pie magpie (see
pie (n.2)), in reference to the bird's black and white plumage. Earliest use is in reference to the
pyed freres, an order of friars who wore black and white. Also in pied piper (1845, in Browning's
poem based on the German legend; used allusively by 1939).


pie (n.3)

also pi, printers' slang for a mass of type jumbled together (also pi, pye), 1650s, perhaps from pie
(n.1) on notion of a medley, or pie (n.2); compare pica (n.1). As a verb from 1870. Related: Pied.


pica (n.1)

size of type of about six lines to the inch (12 point), 1580s, probably from pica, name of a book of
rules in Church of England for determining holy days (late 15c. in Anglo-Latin), probably from Latin
pica magpie (see pie (n.2)); the book so called perhaps from the color and the pied look of the old
type on close-printed pages. The type size was that generally used to print ordinals.


cap-a-pie (adj.)

1520s, from Middle French cap-&agrave;-pie, literally head to foot. The more usual French form is de
pied en cap. The French words are from Latin  caput head (see head (n.)) + pedem foot (see foot
(n.)).


pedigree (n.)

early 15c., genealogical table or chart, from Anglo-French pe de gru, a variant of Old French pied
de gru foot of a crane, from Latin pedem accusative of pes foot (see foot (n.)) + gruem (nominative
grus) crane, cognate with Greek geranos, Old English cran; see crane (n.)).    On old manuscripts,
descent was indicated by a forked sign resembling the branching lines of a genealogical chart; the
sign also happened to look like a bird's footprint. Form influenced in Middle English by association
with degree. Meaning ancestral line is mid-15c.; of animals, c.1600. Related: Pedigreed.
