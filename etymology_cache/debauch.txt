debauchee (n.)

1660s, from French d&eacute;bauch&eacute; debauched (person), noun use of past participle of
debaucher (see debauch).  <b>Debauchee</b>, n. One who has so earnestly pursued pleasure that he has
had the misfortune to overtake it. [Ambrose Bierce, Devil's Dictionary, 1911]


debauchery (n.)

1640s, from debauch + -ery. With a variety of spellings in 17c., such as debaush-, deboich-,
debosh-.


debauch (v.)

1590s, from Middle French d&eacute;baucher entice from work or duty, from Old French desbaucher to
lead astray, supposedly literally to trim (wood) to make a beam (from bauch beam, from Frankish balk
or some other Germanic source akin to English balk (n.)). A sense of shaving something away,
perhaps, but the root is also said to be a word meaning workshop, which gets toward the notion of to
lure someone off the job; either way the sense evolution is unclear.


deboshed (adj.)

1590s, anglicized spelling of French pronunciation of debauched dissolute (see debauch). Obsolete in
England after mid-17c., retained in Scotland, and given a revival of sorts by Scott (1826), so that
it turns up in 19c. literary works.


adulteration (n.)

c.1500, from Latin adulterationem (nominative adulteratio), noun of action from past participle stem
of adulterare corrupt, falsify; debauch; commit adultery, from ad- to (see ad-) + alterare to alter
(see alter).
