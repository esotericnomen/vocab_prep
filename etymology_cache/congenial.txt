congenial (adj.)

1620s, kindred, sympathetic, from Latin com- together (see com-) + genialis of birth, thus, kindred
(see genus). Sense of agreeable is first recorded 1711. Related: Congeniality.

1774, variant of congenial.


uncongenial (adj.)

1749, from un- (1) not + congenial (adj.).


congenital (adj.)

existing from birth, 1796, from Latin congenitus, from com- together, with (see com-) + genitus,
past participle of gignere to beget (see genus). The sense formerly belonged to congenial. Related:
Congenitally.


rookie (n.)

raw recruit, 1892 in that spelling, popularized by Kipling's Barrack-Room Ballads, of uncertain
origin, perhaps from recruit, influenced by rook (n.1) in its secondary sense, suggesting easy to
cheat. Barr&#232;re [A Dictionary of Slang, Jargon &amp; Cant, 1890] has Rookey (army), a recruit;
from the black coat some of them wear, so perhaps directly from rook (n.1). Came into general use in
American English during the Spanish-American War.    The rapid growth of a word from a single seed
transplanted in a congenial soil is one of the curiosities of literature. Take a single instance. A
few weeks ago there was not one American soldier in a thousand who knew there was such a word as
rookey. To-day there are few soldiers and ex-soldiers who have not substituted it for raw recruit.
