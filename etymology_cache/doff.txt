doff (v.)

mid-14c., contraction of do off, preserving the original sense of do as put. At the time of
Johnson's Dictionary [1755] the word was obsolete, and rarely used except by rustics, but it was
saved from extinction (along with don) by Sir Walter Scott. Related: Doffed; doffing.


don (v.)

early 14c. contraction of do on (see doff). After 1650 retained in popular use only in north.
dialect; as a literary archaism it has become very frequent in 19th c. [OED]. Related: Donned;
donning.


douse (v.)

1550s, to strike, punch, which is perhaps from Middle Dutch dossen beat forcefully or a similar Low
German word.    Meaning to strike a sail in haste is recorded from 1620s; that of to extinguish (a
light) is from 1785; perhaps influenced by dout (1520s), an obsolete contraction of do out (compare
doff, don). OED regards the meaning to plunge into water, to throw water over (c.1600) as a separate
word, of unknown origin, though admitting there may be a connection of some sort. Related: Doused;
dousing.
