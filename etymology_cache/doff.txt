mid-14c., contraction of do off, preserving the original sense of <a
href=/index.php?term=do&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>do</a> as put. At the time of
Johnson's Dictionary [1755] the word was obsolete, and rarely used except by rustics, but it was
saved from extinction (along with don) by Sir Walter Scott. Related: Doffed; doffing.
