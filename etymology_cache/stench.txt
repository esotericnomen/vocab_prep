Old English stenc a smell, odor, scent, fragrance (either pleasant or unpleasant), from Proto-
Germanic *stankwiz (cognates: Old Saxon stanc, Old High German stanch, German stank). Related to
stincan emit a smell (see <a href=/index.php?term=stink&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>stink</a> (v.)) as drench is to drink. It tended toward bad smell in Old
English (as a verb, only with this sense), and the notion of evil smell has predominated since
c.1200.
