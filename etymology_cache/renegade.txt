Muslim, from Medieval Latin renegatus, noun use of past participle of renegare deny (see renege).

recreant (n.)

faint-hearted wretch; from recreant (adj.) and from Old French recreant as a noun, one who
acknowledges defeat, a craven, coward, renegade, traitor, wretch. In English, sense of apostate,

neo-conservative (n.)

also neoconservative; used in the modern sense by 1979:    My Republican vote [in the 1972
presidential election] produced little shock waves in the New York intellectual community. It didn't
take long - a year or two - for the socialist writer Michael Harrington to come up with the term
neoconservative to describe a renegade liberal like myself. To the chagrin of some of my friends, I
decided to accept that term; there was no point calling myself a liberal when no one else did.
[Irving Kristol, Forty Good Years, The Public Interest, Spring 2005]    The term is attested from
1960, but it originally often was applied to Russell Kirk and his followers, who would be
philosophically opposed to the later neocons. From neo- + conservative.
