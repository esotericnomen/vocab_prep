improvise (v.)

1826, back-formation from improvisation, or else from French improviser (17c.), from Italian
improvisare to sing or speak extempore, from improviso, from Latin improvisus unforeseen, unexpected
(see improvisation). Or possibly a back-formation from improvisation. Related: Improvised;
improvising.


shuck (v.)

to remove the shucks from, 1819, from or related to shuck (n.). Related: Shucked; shucking.    Many
extended senses are from the notion of stripping an ear of corn, or from the capers associated with
husking frolics; such as to strip (off) one's clothes (1848) and to deceive, swindle, cheat, fool
(1959); phrase shucking and jiving fooling, deceiving is suggested from 1966, in U.S. black English,
but compare shuck (v.) a slang term among cool musicians for to improvise chords, especially to a
piece of music one does not know (1957), and shuck (n.) a theft or fraud, in use by 1950s among U.S.
blacks.    [B]lack senses probably fr[om] the fact that black slaves sang and shouted gleefully
during corn-shucking season, and this behavior, along with lying and teasing, became a part of the
protective and evasive behavior normally adopted towards white people in traditional race relations;
the sense of swindle is perhaps related to the mid-1800s term to be shucked out, be defeated, be
denied victory, which suggests that the notion of stripping someone as an ear of corn is stripped
may be basic in the semantics. [Dictionary of American Slang]
