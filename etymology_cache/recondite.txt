recondite (adj.)

1640s, removed or hidden from view, from Old French recondit, from Latin reconditus, past participle
of recondere store away, hide, conceal, put back again, put up again, lay up, from re- away, back
(see re-) + condere to store, hide, put together, from con- together (see con-) + -dere to put,
place, comb. form of dare to give (see date (n.1)). Meaning removed from ordinary understanding,
profound is from 1650s; of writers or sources, obscure, it is recorded from 1817.


porcelain (n.)

1530s, from Middle French porcelaine and directly from Italian porcellana porcelain (13c.),
literally cowrie shell, the chinaware so called from resemblance of its lustrous transparency to the
shiny surface of the shells. The shell's name in Italian is from porcella young sow, fem. of Latin
porcellus young pig, diminutive of porculus piglet, diminutive of porcus pig (see pork (n.)).
According to an old theory, the connection of the shell and the pig is a perceived resemblance of
the shell opening to the exposed outer genitalia of pigs.   <b>porcelain</b> is china &amp; china is
p.; there is no recondite difference between the two things, which indeed are not two, but one;
&amp; the difference between the two words is merely that china is the homely term, while porcelain
is exotic &amp; literary. [Fowler]
