warren (n.)

late 14c., piece of land enclosed for breeding beasts and fowls, from Anglo-French and Old North
French warenne (Old French garenne) game park, hunting reserve, possibly from Gaulish *varenna
enclosed area, related to *varros post. More likely from the present participle of Old North French
warir (Old French garir) defend, keep, from Proto-Germanic *war- to protect, guard (see warrant
(n.)). Later especially piece of land for breeding of rabbits (c.1400), which led to the transferred
sense of cluster of densely populated living spaces (1640s).
