early 15c., defense, justification, from Late Latin apologia, from Greek apologia a speech in
defense, from apologeisthai to speak in one's defense, from apologos an account, story, from apo-
from, off (see <a href=/index.php?term=apo-&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>apo-</a>) +
logos speech (see <a href=/index.php?term=lecture&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>lecture</a> (n.)).  <br /><br />  The original English sense of self-
justification yielded a meaning frank expression of regret for wrong done, first recorded 1590s, but
this was not the main sense until 18c. The old sense tends to emerge in Latin form apologia (first
attested in English 1784), especially since J.H. Newman's Apologia pro Vita Sua (1864).
