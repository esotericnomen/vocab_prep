mid-15c., from Latin pius dutiful, devout, conscientious, religious; faithful to kindred; inspired
by friendship, prompted by natural affections, perhaps [Klein] related to Latin purus pure, clean
(see <a href=/index.php?term=pure&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>pure</a>). Often
coupled with fraud (n.) from at least 1630s. Related: Piously; piousness.
