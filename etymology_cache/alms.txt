Old English &aelig;lmesse alms, almsgiving, from Proto-Germanic *alemosna (cognates: Old Saxon
alamosna, Old High German alamuosan, Old Norse &ouml;lmusa), an early borrowing of Vulgar Latin
*alemosyna (source of Old Spanish almosna, Old French almosne, Italian limosina), from Church Latin
eleemosyna (Tertullian, 3c.), from Greek eleemosyne pity, mercy, in Ecclesiastical Greek charity,
alms, from eleemon compassionate, from eleos pity, mercy, of unknown origin, perhaps imitative of
cries for alms. Spelling perversion in Vulgar Latin is perhaps by influence of alimonia.
