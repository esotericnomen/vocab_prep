early 13c., to form, fashion; c.1300, to plan, contrive, from Old French deviser dispose in
portions, arrange, plan, contrive (in modern French, to chat, gossip), from Vulgar Latin *divisare,
frequentative of Latin dividere to divide (see <a href=/index.php?term=divide&amp;allowed_in_frame=0

will), a meaning present in the Old French word. Related: Devised; devising.
