devise (v.)

early 13c., to form, fashion; c.1300, to plan, contrive, from Old French deviser dispose in
portions, arrange, plan, contrive (in modern French, to chat, gossip), from Vulgar Latin *divisare,
frequentative of Latin dividere to divide (see divide). Modern sense is from to arrange a division
(especially via a will), a meaning present in the Old French word. Related: Devised; devising.
