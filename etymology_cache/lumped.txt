a- (1)

in native (derived from Old English) words, it most commonly represents Old English an on (see a
(2)), as in alive, asleep, abroad, afoot, etc., forming adjectives and adverbs from nouns; but it
also can be Middle English of, as in anew, abreast (1590s); or a reduced form of Old English past
participle prefix ge-, as in aware; or the Old English intensive a-, as in arise, awake, ashame,
marking a verb as momentary, a single event. In words from Romanic languages, often it represents
Latin ad- to, at.[I]t naturally happened that all these a- prefixes were at length confusedly lumped
together in idea, and the resultant a- looked upon as vaguely intensive, rhetorical, euphonic, or
even archaic, and wholly otiose. [OED]
