1706, debauched, disreputable, from <a href=/index.php?term=rake&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>rake</a> (n.2) + <a href=/index.php?term=-ish&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>-ish</a>. Related: Rakishly; rakishness.  <br /><br />  The meaning smart,
jaunty, dashing (1824) is said to be a different word, probably from rake slant, slope (1620s), used
especially in reference to a ship's hull or sails, of uncertain origin, perhaps from Scandinavian
(compare Old Swedish raka project, reach; Danish rage protrude, project) related to Old English
reccan stretch. The piratical craft of former times were distinguished for their rakish build
