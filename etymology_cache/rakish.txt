rakish (adj.)

1706, debauched, disreputable, from rake (n.2) + -ish. Related: Rakishly; rakishness.    The meaning
smart, jaunty, dashing (1824) is said to be a different word, probably from rake slant, slope
(1620s), used especially in reference to a ship's hull or sails, of uncertain origin, perhaps from
Scandinavian (compare Old Swedish raka project, reach; Danish rage protrude, project) related to Old
English reccan stretch. The piratical craft of former times were distinguished for their rakish
build [Century Dictionary].


don juan (n.)

philanderer, from the legendary dissolute Spanish nobleman whose rakish exploits formed the stuff of
popular tales in Spain from early 17c., dramatized by Gabriel Tellez in Convivado de Piedra. Adapted
into French and Italian before 1700; Used attributively in English for ladies' man, womanizer from
the time of Byron's popular poem about him (1819).
