curtail (v.)

late 15c., from Middle French courtault made short, from court short (Old French cort, from Latin
curtus; see curt) + -ault pejorative suffix of Germanic origin. Originally curtal; used of horses
with docked tails, which probably influenced the spelling in general use; curtal is retained in
poetics to describe a shortened stanza or poem. Related: Curtailed; curtailing.
