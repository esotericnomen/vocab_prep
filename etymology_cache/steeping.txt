steep (v.)

to soak in a liquid, early 14c., of uncertain origin, originally in reference to barley or malt,
probably cognate with Old Norse steypa to pour out, throw (perhaps from an unrecorded Old English
cognate), from Proto-Germanic *staupijanan. Related: Steeped; steeping.


malt (n.)

Old English malt (Anglian), mealt (West Saxon), from Proto-Germanic *maltam (cognates: Old Norse
malt, Old Saxon malt, Middle Dutch, Dutch mout, Old High German malz, German Malz malt), from PIE
*meld- (see melt (v.)), extended form of root *mel- soft, probably via notion of softening the grain
by steeping it in water before brewing. Finnish mallas, Old Church Slavonic mlato are considered to
be borrowed from Germanic.


tan (v.)

Latin tannare tan, dye a tawny color (c.900), from tannum crushed oak bark, used in tanning leather,
