isotope (n.)

1913, literally having the same place, introduced by British chemist Frederick Soddy (1877-1956) on
suggestion of Margaret Todd, from Greek isos equal (see iso-) + topos place (see topos); so called
because despite the different atomic weights, the various forms of an element occupy the same place
on the periodic table.


radioisotope (n.)

1946, from radio-, comb. form of radiation, + isotope.


enrich (v.)

late 14c., to make wealthy, from Old French enrichir enrich, enlarge, from en- make, put in (see en-
(1)) + riche rich (see rich).    Figurative sense is from 1590s. Scientific sense of to increase the
abundance of a particular isotope in some material is first attested 1945. Related: Enriched;
enriching.


carbon (n.)

non-metallic element, 1789, coined 1787 in French by Lavoisier as charbone, from Latin carbonem
(nominative carbo) a coal, glowing coal; charcoal, from PIE root *ker- (4) heat, fire, to burn
(cognates: Latin cremare to burn; Sanskrit krsna black, burnt, kudayati singes; Lithuanian kuriu to
heat, kar&#353;tas hot, krosnis oven; Old Church Slavonic kurjo to smoke, krada fireplace, hearth;
Russian ceren brazier; Old High German harsta roasting; Gothic hauri coal; Old Norse hyrr fire; Old
English heor&eth; hearth).   Carbon 14, long-lived radioactive isotope used in dating organic
deposits, is from 1936. Carbon dating (using carbon 14) is recorded from 1958. Carbon cycle is
attested from 1912. Carbon footprint was in use by 2001. Carbon paper (soon to be obsolete) is from
1895.
