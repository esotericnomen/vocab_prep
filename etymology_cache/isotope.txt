1913, literally having the same place, introduced by British chemist Frederick Soddy (1877-1956) on
suggestion of Margaret Todd, from Greek isos equal (see <a
href=/index.php?term=iso-&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>iso-</a>) + topos place (see
<a href=/index.php?term=topos&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>topos</a>); so called
because despite the different atomic weights, the various forms of an element occupy the same place
on the periodic table.
