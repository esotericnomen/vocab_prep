isotope (n.)

1913, literally having the same place, introduced by British chemist Frederick Soddy (1877-1956) on
suggestion of Margaret Todd, from Greek isos equal (see iso-) + topos place (see topos); so called
because despite the different atomic weights, the various forms of an element occupy the same place
on the periodic table.
