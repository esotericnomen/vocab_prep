1715, from French effronterie, from effront&eacute; shameless, from Old French esfronte shameless,
brazen, probably from Late Latin effrontem (nominative effrons) barefaced, from Latin ex- out (see
<a href=/index.php?term=ex-&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>ex-</a>) + frontem
(nominative frons) brow (see <a href=/index.php?term=front&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>front</a> (n.)).  <br /><br />  Latin frontus had a sense of ability to blush,
but the literal sense of effrontery often has been taken to be putting forth the forehead. Forehead
in Johnson's Dictionary (1755) has a secondary sense of impudence; confidence; assurance;
audaciousness; audacity.
