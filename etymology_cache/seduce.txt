1520s, to persuade a vassal, etc., to desert his allegiance or service, from Latin seducere lead
away, lead astray, from se- aside, away (see <a href=/index.php?term=secret&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>secret</a> (n.)) + ducere to lead (see <a
href=/index.php?term=duke&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>duke</a> (n.)). Sexual sense,
now the prevailing one, is attested from 1550s and apparently was not in Latin. Originally entice (a
woman) to a surrender of chastity. Related: Seduced; seducing.  <br /><br />  Replaced Middle
English seduisen (late 15c.), from Middle French s&eacute;duire seduce, from Old French suduire to
corrupt, seduce, from Latin subducere draw away, withdraw, remove (see <a
href=/index.php?term=subduce&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>subduce</a>).
