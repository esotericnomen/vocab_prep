recourse (n.)

late 14c., from Old French recours (13c.), from Latin recursus a return, a retreat, literally a
running back, a going back, from stem of past participle of recurrere run back, return (see recur).


respite (n.)

mid-13c., from Old French respit delay, respect (Modern French r&#233;pit), from Latin respectus
consideration, recourse, regard (see respect (n.)).


resort (n.)

late 14c., that to which one has recourse for aid or assistance, from Old French resort resource, a
help, an aid, a remedy, back-formation from resortir to resort, literally to go out again, from re-
again (see re-) + sortir go out (see sortie). Meaning place people go for recreation is first
recorded 1754. Phrase in the last resort (1670s) translates French en dernier ressort, originally of
legal appeals.


grim (adj.)

Old English grimm fierce, cruel, savage, dire, painful, from Proto-Germanic *grimmaz (cognates: Old
Saxon, Old Frisian, Old High German, German grimm, Old Norse grimmr, Swedish grym fierce, furious),
from PIE *ghrem- angry, perhaps imitative of the sound of rumbling thunder (compare Greek khremizein
to neigh, Old Church Slavonic vuzgrimeti to thunder, Russian gremet' thunder).    A weaker word now
than once it was; sense of dreary, gloomy first recorded late 12c. It also had a verb form in Old
English, grimman (class III strong verb; past tense gramm, p.p. grummen). Old English also had a
noun, grima goblin, specter, perhaps also a proper name or attribute-name of a god, hence its
appearance as an element in place names.   Grim reaper as a figurative way to say death is attested
by 1847 (the association of grim and death goes back at least to 17c.). A Middle English expression
for have recourse to harsh measures was to wend the grim tooth (early 13c.).
