discomfiture (n.)

mid-14c., from Old French desconfiture rout, defeat (12c.; Modern French d&eacute;confiture), from
desconfit (see discomfit).


discomfit (v.)

c.1200, as an adjective, from Old French desconfit vanquished, defeated, past participle of
desconfire to defeat, destroy, from des- not (see dis-) + confire make, prepare, accomplish, from
Latin conficere (see confection).    Used as a verb in English from c.1300. Weaker sense of
disconcert is first recorded 1520s in English, probably by confusion with discomfort. Related:
Discomfited; discomfiting.


faze (v.)

1830, American English variant of Kentish dialect feeze to frighten, alarm, discomfit (mid-15c.),
from Old English fesian, fysian drive away, from Proto-Germanic *fausjan (cognates: Swedish
f&ouml;sa drive away, Norwegian f&ouml;ysa). Related: Fazed; fazing.


confuse (v.)

1550s, in literal sense mix or mingle things so as to render the elements indistinguishable;
attested from mid-18c. in active, figurative sense of discomfit in mind or feeling; not in general
use until 19c., taking over senses formerly belonging to confound, dumbfound, flabbergast etc. The
past participle confused (q.v.) is attested much earlier (serving as an alternative past tense to
confound), and the verb here might be a back-formation from it. Related: Confusing.
