fresco (n.)

1590s, in fresco, literally in fresh, with a sense of painted on fresh mortar or plaster, from
Italian fresco cool, fresh, from Proto-Germanic *friskaz (see fresh (adj.1)).


al fresco

1753, Italian, literally in the fresh (air). Italian al represents a contraction of words from Latin
ad to (see ad-) + ille that. Alfresco also meant painted on plaster that was still fresh or moist
(1764; see fresco).


provolone (n.)

1946, from Italian, augmentative of provola cheese made from buffalo milk, from Medieval Latin
probula, of uncertain origin.Il nome non ha una derivazione precisa. L'etimologia, secondo alcuni,
fa pensare alla parola napoletana prova-provola con cui in Campania viene indicato il classico
latticino di bufala a pasta filata, da consumarsi fresco. [Dieta Mediterranea]


fresh (adj.1)

late 13c. unsalted, pure, sweet, eager, metathesis of Old English fersc unsalted, from West Germanic
*friskaz (cognates: Old Frisian fersk, Middle Dutch versch, Dutch vers, Old High German frisc,
German frisch fresh).    Probably cognate with Old Church Slavonic presinu fresh, Lithuanian preskas
sweet. The metathesis, and the expanded Middle English senses of new, pure, eager are probably by
influence of (or in some instances, from) Old French fres (fem. fresche), from Proto-Germanic
*frisko-, and thus related to the English word. The Germanic root also is the source of Italian and
Spanish fresco. Related: Freshly; freshness.
