preclude (v.)

1610s, from Latin praecludere to close, shut off; hinder, impede, from prae- before, ahead (see
pre-) + claudere to shut (see close (v.)). Related: Precluded; precluding.


preclusion (n.)

1610s, from Latin praeclusionem (nominative praeclusio) a shutting off, noun of action from past
participle stem of praecludere (see preclude).


veranda (n.)

also verandah, 1711, from Hindi varanda, which probably is from Portuguese varanda, originally long
balcony or terrace, of uncertain origin, possibly related to Spanish baranda railing, and ultimately
from Vulgar Latin *barra barrier, bar. French v&eacute;randa is borrowed from English.    That the
word as used in England and in France was brought by the English from India need not be doubted. But
either in the same sense, or in one closely analogous, it appears to have existed, quite
independently, in Portuguese and Spanish; and the manner in which it occurs without explanation in
the very earliest narrative of the adventure of the Portuguese in India ... seems almost to preclude
the possibility of their having learned it in that country for the first time .... [Col. Henry Yule
and A.C. Burnell, Hobson-Jobson, A Glossary of Colloquial Anglo-Indian Words and Phrases, 1903]
