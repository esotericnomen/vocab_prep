c.1300, earlier aghe, c.1200, from a Scandinavian source, such as Old Norse agi fright; from Proto-
Germanic *agiz- (cognates: Old English ege fear, Old High German agiso fright, terror, Gothic agis
fear, anguish), from PIE *agh-es- (cognates: Greek akhos pain, grief), from root *agh- to be
depressed, be afraid (see <a href=/index.php?term=ail&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>ail</a>). Current sense of dread mixed with veneration is due to biblical use
with reference to the Supreme Being. Awe-inspiring is recorded from 1814.
