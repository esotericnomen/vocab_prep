Conversations]

rancor (n.)

c.1200, from Old French rancor bitterness, resentment; grief, affliction, from Late Latin rancorem
(nominative rancor) rancidness, a stinking smell (Palladius); grudge, bitterness (Hieronymus and in
Late Latin), from Latin rancere to stink (see rancid).


chagrin (n.)

1650s, melancholy, from French chagrin melancholy, anxiety, vexation (14c.), from Old North French
chagreiner or Angevin dialect chagraigner sadden, of unknown origin, perhaps [Gamillscheg] from Old
French graignier grieve over, be angry, from graigne sadness, resentment, grief, vexation, from
graim sorrowful, of unknown origin, perhaps from a Germanic source (compare Old High German gram
angry, fierce). But OED and other sources trace it to an identical Old French word, borrowed into
English phonetically as shagreen, meaning rough skin or hide, of uncertain origin, the connecting
notion being roughness, harshness. Modern sense of feeling of irritation from disappointment is
1716.
