gaunt (adj.)

mid-15c. (as a surname from mid-13c.), from Middle French gant, of uncertain origin; perhaps from a
Scandinavian source (compare Old Norse gand a thin stick, also a tall thin man) and somehow
connected with the root of gander. Connection also has been suggested to Old French jaunet yellowish
[Middle English Dictionary].
