Guelph

one of the two great parties in medieval Italian politics, characterized by support of the popes
against the emperors (opposed to the Ghibellines), 1570s, from Italian Guelfo, from Old High German
Welf, name of a princely family that became the ducal house of Brunswick, literally whelp,
originally the name of the founder. The family are the ancestors of the present dynasty of Great
Britain. The name is said to have been used as a war-cry at the Battle of Weinsberg (1140) by
partisans of Henry the Lion, duke of Bavaria, who was of the family, against Emperor Conrad III;
hence it was adopted in Italy as the name of the anti-imperial party.


puppy (n.)

late 15c., woman's small pet dog, of uncertain origin but likely from Middle French poup&eacute;e
doll, toy (see puppet). Meaning shifted from toy dog to young dog (1590s), replacing Middle English
whelp. In early use in English puppet and puppy were not always distinct from each other. Also used
about that time in sense of vain young man. Puppy-dog first attested 1590s (in Shakespeare, puppi-
dogges). Puppy love is from 1823. Puppy fat is from 1937.
