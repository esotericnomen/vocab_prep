Latin Chimaera, from Greek khimaira, name of a mythical creature, slain by Bellerophon, with a
lion's head, a goat's body, and a serpent's tail (supposedly personification of snow or winter);
literally year-old she-goat (masc. khimaros), from kheima winter season (see hibernation).
Figurative meaning wild fantasy first recorded 1580s in English (attested 13c. in
French).<blockquote>Beestis clepid chymeres, that han a part of ech beest, and suche ben not, no but
oonly in opynyoun. [Wyclif, Prologue]</blockquote>
