Old English hem a border, especially of cloth or a garment, from Proto-Germanic *hamjam (cognates:
Old Norse hemja to bridle, curb, Swedish h&auml;mma to stop, restrain, Old Frisian hemma to hinder,
Middle Dutch, German hemmen to hem in, stop, hinder), from PIE *kem- to compress. Apparently the
same root yielded Old English hamm, common in place names (where it means enclosure, land hemmed in
by water or high ground, land in a river bend). In Middle English, hem also was a symbol of pride or
ostentation.  <blockquote>  If &thorn;ei wer &thorn;e first &thorn;at schuld puplysch &thorn;ese
grete myracles of her mayster, men myth sey of hem, as Crist ded of &thorn;e Pharisees, &thorn;at
&thorn;ei magnified her owne hemmys. [John Capgrave, Life of Saint Gilbert of Sempringham, 1451]
