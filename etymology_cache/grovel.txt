1590s, Shakespearian back-formation of groveling (Middle English), regarded as a present participle
but really an adverb, from Old Norse grufe prone + obsolete adverbial suffix -ling (which survives
also as the -long in <a href=/index.php?term=headlong&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>headlong</a>, <a href=/index.php?term=sidelong&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>sidelong</a>); first element from Old Norse a grufu on proneness. Perhaps
related to <a href=/index.php?term=creep&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>creep</a>.
