megalomaniac

1882 (n.), 1883 (adj.), from megalomania (q.v.).  The megalomaniac differs from the narcissist by
the fact that he wishes to be powerful rather than charming, and seeks to be feared rather than
loved. To this type belong many lunatics and most of the great men of history. [Bertrand Russell,
The Conquest of Happiness]
