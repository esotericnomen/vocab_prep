megalomaniac

1882 (n.), 1883 (adj.), from megalomania (q.v.).  <blockquote>The megalomaniac differs from the
narcissist by the fact that he wishes to be powerful rather than charming, and seeks to be feared
rather than loved. To this type belong many lunatics and most of the great men of history. [Bertrand
Russell, The Conquest of Happiness]</blockquote>
