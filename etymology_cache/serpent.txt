serpent (n.)

c.1300, limbless reptile, also the tempter in Gen. iii:1-5, from Old French serpent, sarpent snake,
serpent (12c.), from Latin serpentem (nominative serpens) snake; creeping thing, also the name of a
constellation, from present participle of serpere to creep, from PIE *serp- to crawl, creep
(cognates: Sanskrit sarpati creeps, sarpah serpent; Greek herpein to creep, herpeton serpent;
Albanian garper serpent).    Used figuratively of things spiral or regularly sinuous, such as a type
of musical instrument (1730). Serpent's tongue as figurative of venomous or stinging speech is from
mistaken medieval notion that the serpent's tongue was its sting. Serpent's tongue also was a name
given to fossil shark's teeth (c.1600).
