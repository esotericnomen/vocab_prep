early 15c., from Middle French vipere, earlier in English as vipera (c.1200), directly from Latin
vipera viper, snake, serpent, contraction of *vivipera, from vivus alive, living (see <a
href=/index.php?term=vital&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>vital</a>) + parere bring
forth, bear (see <a href=/index.php?term=pare&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>pare</a>).
In common with many snake species in cooler climates, in most cases the viper's eggs are kept inside
the mother until hatching.  <br /><br />  Applied to persons of spiteful character since at least
1590s. The only venomous snake found in Great Britain, but not especially dangerous. The word
replaced native <a href=/index.php?term=adder&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>adder</a>.
The flesh of the viper was formerly regarded as possessing great nutritive or restorative
properties, and was frequently used medicinally [OED]; hence viper-wine, wine medicated with some
kind of extract from vipers, used 17c. by gray-bearded gallants in a bid to feele new lust, and
youthfull flames agin. [Massinger]
