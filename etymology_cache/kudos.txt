kudos (n.)

fame, renown, 1799, probably originally in university slang, from Greek kydos glory, fame,
especially in battle, literally that which is heard of (see caveat). A singular noun in Greek, but
the final -s often is mistaken as a plural suffix in English, leading to the barbarous back-
formation kudo (attested by 1936).
