fame, renown, 1799, probably originally in university slang, from Greek kydos glory, fame,
especially in battle, literally that which is heard of (see <a
href=/index.php?term=caveat&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>caveat</a>). A singular noun
in Greek, but the final -s often is mistaken as a plural suffix in English, leading to the barbarous
back-formation kudo (attested by 1936).
