juncture (n.)

late 14c., place where two things are joined, from Latin iunctura a joining, uniting, a joint, from
iunctus, past participle of iungere to join (see jugular). Sense of point in time first recorded
1650s, probably from astrology.


jointure (n.)

late 14c., act or fact of being joined, from Old French jointure a putting together, from Latin
iunctura a joining, juncture (see juncture). Specific legal sense from mid-15c.


disjuncture (n.)

c.1400, surgical, dislocation, from Latin; see dis- + juncture. Figurative use from 1680s.


pinch (n.)

late 15c., critical juncture (as in baseball pinch hitter, attested from 1912), from pinch (v.).
This figurative sense is attested earlier than the literal sense of act of pinching (1590s) or that
of small quantity (as much as can be pinched between a thumb and finger), which is from 1580s. There
is a use of the noun from mid-15c. apparently meaning fold or pleat of fabric.


occasion (n.)

late 14c., opportunity; grounds for action, state of affairs that makes something else possible; a
happening, occurrence, from Old French ochaison, ocasion cause, reason, excuse, pretext; opportunity
(13c.) or directly from Latin occasionem (nominative occasio) opportunity, appropriate time, in Late
Latin cause, from occasum, occasus, past participle of occidere fall down, go down, from ob down,
away (see ob-) + cadere to fall (see case (n.1)). The notion is of a falling together, or juncture,
of circumstances.
