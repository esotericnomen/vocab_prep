late 12c., buhsum humble, obedient, from Proto-Germanic *buh- stem of Old English bugen to bow  (see
<a href=/index.php?term=bow&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>bow</a> (v.)) + -som, for a
total meaning capable of being bent.  <br /><br />  Meaning progressed from compliant, obliging,
through lively, jolly, healthily plump, vigorous, to (in women, and perhaps influenced by lusty)
plump, comely (1580s). Used often of breasts, and by 1950s it had begun to be used more narrowly for
bosomy and could be paired with slim (adj.). Dutch buigzaam, German biegsam flexible, pliable hew
closer to the original sense of the English cognate.
