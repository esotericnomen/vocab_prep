1765, in chess, from stale stalemate (early 15c.) + <a
href=/index.php?term=mate&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>mate</a> (n.2) checkmate.
Middle English stale is probably from Anglo-French estale standstill (see <a
href=/index.php?term=stall&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>stall</a> (n.2)). A misnomer,
because a stale is not a mate. In England from the 17th c. to the beginning of the 19th c. the
player who received stalemate won the game [OED]. Figurative sense is recorded from 1885. As a verb
from 1765; figurative from 1861.
