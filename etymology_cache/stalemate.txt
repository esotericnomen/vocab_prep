stalemate (n.)

1765, in chess, from stale stalemate (early 15c.) + mate (n.2) checkmate. Middle English stale is
probably from Anglo-French estale standstill (see stall (n.2)). A misnomer, because a stale is not a
mate. In England from the 17th c. to the beginning of the 19th c. the player who received stalemate
won the game [OED]. Figurative sense is recorded from 1885. As a verb from 1765; figurative from
1861.


stand-off (n.)

also stand-off, 1843, draw, tie, from the verbal phrase (c.1600), from stand (v.) + off (adv.).
Mexican stand-off stalemate is recorded from 1891.
