warranty (n.)

mid-14c., legal term for various types of clauses in real estate transactions, from Anglo-French and
Old North French warantie protection, defense, safeguard (Old French garantie), from warant (see
warrant (n.)).


warrantee (n.)

person to whom a warranty is given, 1706, from warrant (v.) + -ee.


gu-

because g- followed by some vowels in English usually has a soft pronunciation, a silent -u-
sometimes was inserted between the g- and the vowel in Middle English to signal hardness, especially
in words from French; but this was not done with many Scandinavian words where hard g precedes a
vowel (gear (n.), get (v.), give, etc.). Germanic -w- generally became -gu- in words borrowed into
Romance languages, but Old North French preserved the Frankish -w-, and English sometimes borrowed
both forms, hence guarantee/warranty, guard/ward, etc.
