embroider (v.)

late 14c., from Anglo-French enbrouder, from en- in (see en- (1)) + broisder embroider, from
Frankish *brozdon, from Proto-Germanic *bruzdajan. Spelling with -oi- is from c.1600, perhaps by
influence of broiden, irregular alternative Middle English past participle of braid (v.). Related:
Embroidered; embroidering.
