refrain (n.)

late 14c., from Old French refrain chorus (13c.), alteration of refrait, noun use of past participle
of refraindre repeat, also break off, from Vulgar Latin *refrangere break off, alteration of Latin
refringere break up, break open (see refraction) by influence of frangere to break. Influenced in
French by cognate Proven&ccedil;al refranhar singing of birds, refrain. The notion is of something
that causes a song to break off then resume. OED says not common before 19c.
