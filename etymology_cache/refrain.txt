late 14c., from Old French refrain chorus (13c.), alteration of refrait, noun use of past participle
of refraindre repeat, also break off, from Vulgar Latin *refrangere break off, alteration of Latin
refringere break up, break open (see <a href=/index.php?term=refraction&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>refraction</a>) by influence of frangere to break. Influenced in French by
cognate Proven&ccedil;al refranhar singing of birds, refrain. The notion is of something that causes
a song to break off then resume. OED says not common before 19c.
