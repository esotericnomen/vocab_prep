amphibian (adj.)

amphibios living a double life, from amphi- of both kinds (see amphi-) + bios life (see bio-).
Formerly used by zoologists to describe all sorts of combined natures (including otters and seals),
the biological sense class of animals between fishes and reptiles that live both on land and in
water and the noun derivative both are first recorded 1835. Amphibia was used in this sense from

salamander (n.)

mid-14c., legendary lizard-like creature that can live in fire, from Old French salamandre legendary
fiery beast, also cricket (12c.), from Latin salamandra, from Greek salamandra, probably of eastern
origin.     The application in zoology to a tailed amphibian (known natively as an eft or newt) is
first recorded 1610s. Aristotle, and especially Pliny, are responsible for the fiction of an animal
that thrives in and extinguishes fires. The eft lives in damp logs and secretes a milky substance
when threatened, but there is no obvious natural explanation its connection with the myth.    Also
used 18c. for a woman who lives chastely in the midst of temptations (after Addison), and a soldier
who exposes himself to fire in battle. To rub someone a salamander was a 19c. form of German student
drinking toast (einem einen salamander reiben). Related: Salamandrine; salamandroid.
