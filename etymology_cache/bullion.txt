early 15c., uncoined gold or silver, from Anglo-French bullion bar of precious metal, also place
where coins are made, mint, perhaps, through the notion of melting, from Old French boillir to boil,
from Latin bullire boil (see <a href=/index.php?term=boil&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>boil</a> (v.)). But perhaps it is rather from Old French bille stick, block of
wood (see <a href=/index.php?term=billiards&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
