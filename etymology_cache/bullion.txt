bullion (n.)

early 15c., uncoined gold or silver, from Anglo-French bullion bar of precious metal, also place
where coins are made, mint, perhaps, through the notion of melting, from Old French boillir to boil,
from Latin bullire boil (see boil (v.)). But perhaps it is rather from Old French bille stick, block
of wood (see billiards).
