bullion (n.)

early 15c., uncoined gold or silver, from Anglo-French bullion bar of precious metal, also place
where coins are made, mint, perhaps, through the notion of melting, from Old French boillir to boil,
from Latin bullire boil (see boil (v.)). But perhaps it is rather from Old French bille stick, block
of wood (see billiards).


specie (n.)

coin, money in the form of coins, metallic money as a medium of exchange (as opposed to paper money
or bullion), 1670s, from phrase in specie in the real or actual form (1550s), from Latin in specie
in kind (in Medieval Latin, in coin), from ablative of species kind, form, sort (see species).
