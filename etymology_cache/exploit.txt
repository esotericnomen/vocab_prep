exploit (v.)

c.1400 espleiten, esploiten to accomplish, achieve, fulfill, from Old French esploitier, espleiter,
from esploit (see exploit (n.)). The sense of use selfishly first recorded 1838, from French,
perhaps extended from use of the word with reference to mines, etc. (compare exploitation). Related:
Exploited; exploiting. As an adjective form, exploitative (1882) is from French; exploitive (by
1859) appears to be a native formation.
