c.1400 espleiten, esploiten to accomplish, achieve, fulfill, from Old French esploitier, espleiter,
from esploit (see <a href=/index.php?term=exploit&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>exploit</a> (n.)). The sense of use selfishly first recorded 1838, from French,
perhaps extended from use of the word with reference to mines, etc. (compare <a
href=/index.php?term=exploitation&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>exploitation</a>).
Related: Exploited; exploiting. As an adjective form, exploitative (1882) is from French; exploitive
(by 1859) appears to be a native formation.
