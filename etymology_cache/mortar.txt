also mortar-board, academic cap, 1854, probably from <a
href=/index.php?term=mortar&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>mortar</a> (1) + <a
href=/index.php?term=board&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>board</a> (n.1); so called
because it resembles a mason's square board for carrying mortar.  Earlier it was called a mortar cap
(1680s) or simply morter (c.1600), from French mortier.
