squander (v.)

1580s (implied in squandering), to spend recklessly or prodigiously, of unknown origin; Shakespeare
used it in Merchant of Venice (1593) with a sense of to be scattered over a wide area. Squander-bug,
a British symbol of reckless extravagance and waste during war-time shortages, represented as a
devilish insect, was introduced 1943. In U.S., Louis Ludlow coined squanderlust (1935) for the
tendency of government bureaucracies to spend much money.
