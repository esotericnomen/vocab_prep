cognizance (n.)

mid-14c., from Anglo-French conysance recognition, later, knowledge, from Old French conoissance
acquaintance, recognition; knowledge, wisdom (Modern French connaissance), from past participle of
conoistre to know, from Latin cognoscere to get to know, recognize, from com- together (see co-) +
gnoscere to know (see notice (n.)). The -g- was restored in English spelling 15c. and has gradually
affected the pronunciation, which was always con-. The old pronunciation lingered longest in legal
use.
