mid-14c., from Anglo-French conysance recognition, later, knowledge, from Old French conoissance
acquaintance, recognition; knowledge, wisdom (Modern French connaissance), from past participle of
conoistre to know, from Latin cognoscere to get to know, recognize, from com- together (see <a
href=/index.php?term=co-&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>co-</a>) + gnoscere to know
(see <a href=/index.php?term=notice&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>notice</a> (n.)).
The -g- was restored in English spelling 15c. and has gradually affected the pronunciation, which
was always con-. The old pronunciation lingered longest in legal use.
