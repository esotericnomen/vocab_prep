amphitheater (n.)

late 14c., from Latin amphitheatrum, from Greek amphitheatron double theater, amphitheater, neuter
of amphitheatros with spectators all around, from amphi- on both sides (see amphi-) + theatron
theater (see theater). Classical theaters were semi-circles, thus two together made an amphi-
theater.
