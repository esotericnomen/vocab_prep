debase (v.)

1560s, from de- down + base (adj.) low, on analogy of abase (or, alternatively, from obsolete verb
base to abuse).


Arian (adj.)

1530s, pertaining to the doctrines of Arius, priest in Alexandria early 4c., who posed the question
of Christ's nature in terms which appeared to debase the Savior's relation to God (denial of
consubstantiation). Besides taking an abstract view of Christ's nature, he reaffirmed man's capacity
for perfection. The dissention was widespread and split the Church for about a century during a
crucial time.


bastardize (v.)

1610s, to identify as a bastard, from bastard (q.v.) + -ize. The figurative sense, to make
degenerate, debase is earlier (1580s), probably because bastard also was serving as a verb meaning
to declare illegitimate (1540s). Related: Bastardized; bastardizing; bastardization.


demean (v.)

lower in dignity, c.1600, perhaps from de- down + mean (adj.) and modeled on debase.
Indistinguishable in some uses from obsolete demean (see demeanor) which influenced it and may be
its true source. Related: Demeaned; demeaning.


smut (n.)

1660s, black mark, stain, from verb smutten debase, defile (late 14c.), later stain or mark with
soot, etc. (1580s), cognate with Middle High German smotzen make dirty, from West Germanic *smutt-
(cognates: Middle High German smuz grease, dirt; German Schmutz dirt, schmutzen to make dirty). The
meaning indecent or obscene language is first attested 1660s.
