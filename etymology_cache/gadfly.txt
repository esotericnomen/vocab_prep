class=crossreference>gad</a> (n.) goad, metal rod, here in the sense of stinger; but the sense is
entangled with gad (v.) and another early meaning of gadfly was someone who likes to go about, often
stopping here and there (1610s). Sense of one who irritates another is from 1640s (equivalent of
Latin oestrus).
