gadfly (n.)

1620s, fly which bites cattle, probably from gad (n.) goad, metal rod, here in the sense of stinger;
but the sense is entangled with gad (v.) and another early meaning of gadfly was someone who likes
to go about, often stopping here and there (1610s). Sense of one who irritates another is from 1640s
(equivalent of Latin oestrus).


estrus (n.)

1850, frenzied passion, from Latin oestrus frenzy, gadfly, from Greek oistros gadfly, breeze, sting,
mad impulse, perhaps from a PIE *eis, forming words denoting passion (cognates: Avestan ae&#353;ma-
anger, Lithuanian aistra violent passion, Latin ira anger). First attested 1890 with specific
meaning rut in animals, heat. Earliest use (1690s) was for a gadfly. Related: Estrous (1900).


ire (n.)

c.1300, from Old French ire anger, wrath, violence (11c.), from Latin ira anger, wrath, rage,
passion, from PIE root *eis-, forming various words denoting passion cognates: Greek hieros filled
with the divine, holy, oistros gadfly, originally thing causing madness; Sanskrit esati drives on,
yasati boils; Avestan aesma anger).    Old English irre in a similar sense is from an adjective irre
wandering, straying, angry, cognate with Old Saxon irri angry, Old High German irri wandering,
deranged, also angry; Gothic airzeis astray, and Latin errare wander, go astray, angry (see err
(v.)).
