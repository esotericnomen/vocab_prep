immaculate (adj.)

early 15c., free from mental or moral pollution, pure, from a figurative use of Latin immaculatus
unstained, from assimilated form of in- not, opposite of (see in- (1)) + maculatus spotted, defiled,
past participle of maculare to spot, from macula spot, blemish. The literal sense of spotlessly
clean or neat in English is first attested 1735. Immaculate Conception is late 15c., from Middle
French conception immacul&eacute;e (late 15c.); declared to be an article of faith in 1854.
