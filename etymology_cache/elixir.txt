elixir (n.)

mid-13c., from Medieval Latin elixir philosopher's stone, believed by alchemists to transmute baser
metals into gold and/or to cure diseases and prolong life, from Arabic al-iksir, probably from late
Greek xerion powder for drying wounds, from xeros dry (see xerasia). General sense of strong tonic
is 1590s; used for quack medicines from at least 1630s.


Tylenol (n.)

introduced 1955 as the name of an elixir for children, trade name originally registered by McNeil
Laboratories, Philadelphia, Pa., from elements abstracted from N-acetyl-para-aminophenol, the
chemical name of its active compound.


philosopher (n.)

from Old English philosophe, from Latin philosophus philosopher, from Greek philosophos philosopher,
sage, one who speculates on the nature of things and truth, literally lover of wisdom, from philos
loving (see -phile) + sophos wise, a sage (see sophist). Modern form with -r appears early 14c.,
from an Anglo-French or Old French variant of philosophe, with an agent-noun ending.  Pythagoras was
the first who called himself philosophos, instead of sophos, 'wise man,' since this latter term was
suggestive of immodesty. [Klein] Philosophy also was used of alchemy in Middle Ages, hence
Philosophers' stone (late 14c., translating Medieval Latin lapis philosophorum, early 12c.), a
reputed solid substance supposed by alchemists to change baser metals into gold or silver; also
identified with the elixir and thus given the attribute of prolonging life indefinitely and curing
wounds and disease. (French pierre philosophale, German der Stein der Weisen).
