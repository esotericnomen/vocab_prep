late 14c., of or pertaining to desires or appetites, from Old French voluptueux, volumptueuse and
directly from Latin voluptuosus full of pleasure, delightful, from voluptas pleasure, delight,
enjoyment, satisfaction, from volup pleasurably, perhaps ultimately related to velle to wish, from
PIE *wel- (2) to wish, will (see will (v.)). Meaning addicted to sensual pleasure is recorded from
mid-15c. Sense of suggestive of sensual pleasure is attested from 1816 (Byron); especially in
reference to feminine beauty from 1839. Related: Voluptuously; voluptuousness.
