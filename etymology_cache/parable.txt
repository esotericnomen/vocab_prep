parable (n.)

mid-13c., parabol, modern form from early 14c., saying or story in which something is expressed in
terms of something else, from Old French parable parable, parabolic style in writing (13c.), from
Latin parabola comparison, from Greek parabole a comparison, parable, literally a throwing beside,
hence a juxtaposition, from para- alongside (see para- (1)) + bole a throwing, casting, beam, ray,
related to ballein to throw (see ballistics).    Replaced Old English bispell. In Vulgar Latin,
parabola took on the meaning word, hence Italian parlare, French parler to speak (see parley (n.)).
