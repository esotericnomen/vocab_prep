terms of something else, from Old French parable parable, parabolic style in writing (13c.), from
Latin parabola comparison, from Greek parabole a comparison, parable, literally a throwing beside,
hence a juxtaposition, from para- alongside (see <a

throwing, casting, beam, ray, related to ballein to throw (see <a

/><br />  Replaced Old English bispell. In Vulgar Latin, parabola took on the meaning word, hence
Italian parlare, French parler to speak (see <a href=/index.php?term=parley&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
