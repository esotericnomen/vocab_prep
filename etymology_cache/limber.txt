detachable forepart of a gun carriage, 1620s, from Middle English lymer (early 15c.), earlier lymon
(c.1400), probably from Old French limon shaft, a word perhaps of Celtic origin, or possibly from
Germanic and related to <a href=/index.php?term=limb&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>limb</a> (n.1). Hence, limber (v.) to attach a limber to a gun (1783). Compare
related Spanish limon shaft, leman helmsman.
