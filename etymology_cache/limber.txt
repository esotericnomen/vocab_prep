limber (n.)

detachable forepart of a gun carriage, 1620s, from Middle English lymer (early 15c.), earlier lymon
(c.1400), probably from Old French limon shaft, a word perhaps of Celtic origin, or possibly from
Germanic and related to limb (n.1). Hence, limber (v.) to attach a limber to a gun (1783). Compare
related Spanish limon shaft, leman helmsman.


limber (adj.)

pliant, flexible, 1560s, of uncertain origin, possibly from limb (n.1) on notion of supple boughs of
a tree [Barnhart], or from limp flaccid [Skeat], or somehow from Middle English lymer shaft of a
cart (see limber (n.)), but the late appearance of the -b- in that word argues against it. Related:
Limberness. Dryden used limber-ham (see ham (n.1) in the joint sense) as a name for a character
perswaded by what is last said to him, and changing next word.


limber (v.)

1748, from limber (adj.). Related: Limbered; limbering.


unlimber (v.)

1760, to free (a gun) from its limber, usually for the purpose of bringing it into action, from un-
(2) opposite of + limber attach a gun to its limber (see limber (n.)). Figurative sense is attested
from 1864. Related: Unlimbered; unlimbering.


limbo (n.2)

dance in which the dancer bends backward and passes under a bar, 1956, of W.Indian origin, probably
an alteration of limber.


lagniappe (n.)

dividend, something extra, 1849, from New Orleans creole, of unknown origin though much speculated
upon. Originally a bit of something given by New Orleans shopkeepers to customers. Said to be from
American Spanish la &ntilde;apa the gift. Klein says this is in turn from Quechua yapa something
added, gift.We picked up one excellent word -- a word worth travelling to New Orleans to get; a
nice, limber, expressive, handy word -- 'lagniappe.' They pronounce it lanny-yap. It is Spanish --
so they said. [Mark Twain, Life on the Mississippi]
