early 15c., from Medieval Latin transparentem (nominative transparens), present participle of
transparere show light through, from Latin trans- through (see <a
href=/index.php?term=trans-&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>trans-</a>) + parere come in
sight, appear (see <a href=/index.php?term=appear&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>appear</a>). Figurative sense of easily seen through is first attested 1590s.
The attempt to back-form a verb transpare (c.1600) died with the 17c. Related: Transparently.
