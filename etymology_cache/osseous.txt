bony, early 15c., from Medieval Latin ossous, from Latin osseus bony, of bone, from os (genitive
ossis) bone, from PIE *ost- bone (cognates: Sanskrit asthi, Hittite hashtai-, Greek osteon bone,
Greek ostrakon oyster shell, Avestan ascu- shinbone, Welsh asgwrn, Armenian oskr, Albanian asht
bone). The word was later reformed in English (1680s), perhaps by influence of French osseux.
