1520s, sideways, asquint, of obscure origin. OED has separate listings for askance and obsolete
Middle English askance(s) and no indication of a connection, but Barnhart and others derive the
newer word from the older one. The Middle English word, recorded early 14c. as ase quances and found
later in Chaucer, meant in such a way that; even as; as if; and as an adverb insincerely,
deceptively. It has been analyzed as a compound of <a href=/index.php?term=as&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>as</a> and Old French quanses (pronounced kanses) how if, from Latin quam how +
si if.  <blockquote>  The E[nglish] as is, accordingly, redundant, and merely added by way of
partial explanation. The M.E. askances means as if in other passages, but here means, as if it were,
i.e. possibly, perhaps; as said above. Sometimes the final s is dropped .... [Walter W. Skeat,
glossary to Chaucer's Man of Law's Tale, 1894]  </blockquote>  Also see discussion in Leo Spitzer,
Anglo-French Etymologies, Philological Quarterly 24.23 (1945), and see OED entry for askance (adv.)
for discussion of the mysterious ask- word cluster in English. Other guesses about the origin of
askance include Old French a escone, from past participle of a word for hidden; Italian a scancio
obliquely, slantingly; or that it is a cognate of <a
