holy, ithqaddash was sanctified, related to Hebrew qadhash was holy, qadhosh holy. According to

sockdolager (n.)

1830, a decisive blow (also, figuratively a conclusive argument), fanciful formation from sock (v.1)
hit hard, perhaps via a comical mangling of doxology, on a notion of finality. The meaning something
exceptional is attested from 1838.   Sockdologising likely was nearly the last word President
Abraham Lincoln heard. During the performance of Tom Taylor's Our American Cousin, assassin John
Wilkes Booth (who knew the play well) waited for the laugh-line Well, I guess I know enough to turn
you inside out, you sockdologising old man-trap. Amid the noise as the audience responded, Booth
fired the fatal shot.
