niggardly (adj.)

1560s, from niggard + -ly (1).  <blockquote>  It was while giving a speech in Washington, to a very
international audience, about the British theft of the Elgin marbles from the Parthenon. I described
the attitude of the current British authorities as niggardly. Nobody said anything, but I privately
resolved -- having felt the word hanging in the air a bit -- to say parsimonious from then on.
