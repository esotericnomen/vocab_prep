niggardly (adj.)

1560s, from niggard + -ly (1).    It was while giving a speech in Washington, to a very
international audience, about the British theft of the Elgin marbles from the Parthenon. I described
the attitude of the current British authorities as niggardly. Nobody said anything, but I privately
resolved -- having felt the word hanging in the air a bit -- to say parsimonious from then on.
[Christopher Hitchens, The Pernicious Effects of Banning Words, Slate.com, Dec. 4, 2006]    As an
adverb from 1520s. Related: Niggardliness.

American English.


stingy (adj.)

niggardly, penurious, extremely tight-fisted, 1650s, of uncertain origin, perhaps a dialectal
alteration of earlier stingy biting, sharp, stinging (1610s), from sting (v.). Back-formation stinge
a stingy person is recorded from 1905. Related: Stingily; stinginess.


niggard (n.)

mean person, miser, late 14c., nygart, of uncertain origin. The suffix suggests French origin (see
-ard), but the root word is possibly from earlier nig stingy (c.1300), perhaps from a Scandinavian
source related to Old Norse hn&oslash;ggr stingy, from Proto-Germanic *khnauwjaz (source of Swedish
njugg close, careful, German genau precise, exact), and to Old English hneaw stingy, niggardly,
which did not survive in Middle English.
