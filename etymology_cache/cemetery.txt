cemetery (n.)

late 14c., from Old French cimetiere graveyard (12c.), from Late Latin coemeterium, from Greek
koimeterion sleeping place, dormitory, from koiman to put to sleep, keimai I lie down, from PIE root
*kei- to lie, rest, also bed, couch, hence secondary sense of beloved, dear (cognates: Greek
keisthai to lie, lie asleep, Old Church Slavonic semija family, domestic servants, Lithuanian
&#353;eima domestic servants, Lettish sieva wife, Old English hiwan members of a household, higid
measure of land, Latin cunae a cradle,  Sanskrit Sivah propitious, gracious). Early Christian
writers were the first to use it for burial ground, though the Greek word also had been anciently
used in reference to the sleep of death. An Old English word for cemetery was licburg.
