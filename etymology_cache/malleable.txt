copper (n.1)

malleable metallic element, Old English coper, from Proto-Germanic *kupar (cognates: Middle Dutch
koper, Old Norse koparr, Old High German kupfar), from Late Latin cuprum, contraction of Latin
Cyprium (aes) Cyprian (metal), after Greek Kyprios Cyprus (see Cyprus).    Latin aes originally was
copper, but this was extended to its alloy with tin, bronze, and as this was far more extensively
used than pure copper, the word's primary sense shifted to the alloy and a new word evolved for
copper, from the Latin form of the name of the island of Cyprus, where copper was mined. Aes passed
into Germanic (which originally did not distinguish copper from its alloys) and became English ore.
In Latin, aes was the common word for cash, coin, debt, wages in many figurative expressions.
Chemical symbol Cu is from cuprum.
