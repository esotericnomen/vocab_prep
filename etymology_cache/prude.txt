prude (n.)

1704, woman who affects or upholds modesty in a degree considered excessive, from French prude
excessively prim or demure woman, first recorded in Moli&egrave;re. Perhaps a false back-formation
or an ellipsis of preudefemme a discreet, modest woman, from Old French prodefame noblewoman,
gentlewoman; wife, consort, fem. equivalent of prudhomme a brave man (see proud); or perhaps a
direct noun use of the French adjective prude prudish, from Old French prude, prode, preude good,
virtuous, modest, a feminine form of the adjective preux. Also occasionally as an adjective in
English 18c.


prudery (n.)

1709, from prude + -ery and in part from French pruderie.  The peculiarity of prudery is to multiply
sentinels, in proportion as the fortress is less threatened. [Victor Hugo, Les Mis&#233;rables]
Some 20c. writers in English used extended form prudibundery, in many cases likely for contemptuous
emphasis, from French prudibonderie prudery.


faux (adj.)

from French faux false (12c., see false). Used with English words at least since 1676 (Etheredge,
faux-prude). Used by itself, with French pronunciation, from 1980s to mean fake.


prudish (adj.)

1717, from prude (adj.) + -ish. Related: Prudishly; prudishness.
