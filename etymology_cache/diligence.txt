mid-14c., from Old French diligence attention, care; haste, speed, from Latin diligentia
attentiveness, carefulness, from diligentem (nominative diligens) attentive, assiduous, careful,
originally present participle of diligere single out, value highly, esteem, prize, love; aspire to,
be content with, appreciate, originally to pick out, select, from dis- apart (see <a
href=/index.php?term=dis-&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>dis-</a>) + legere choose,
gather (see <a href=/index.php?term=lecture&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>lecture</a>
(n.)).  <br /><br />  Sense evolved from love through attentiveness to carefulness to steady effort.
From the secondary French sense comes the old useage of diligence for public stage coach (1742;
dilly for short), from a French shortening of carrosse de diligence.
