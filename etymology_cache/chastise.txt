c.1300, chastisen, from Old French chastiier to warn, advise, instruct; chastise, admonish; punish;
dominate, tame (12c., Modern French ch&acirc;tier), from Latin castigare to set or keep right, to
reprove, chasten, to punish, literally to make pure (see <a
href=/index.php?term=castigate&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>castigate</a>). Or
perhaps from Middle English chastien (see <a href=/index.php?term=chasten&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>chasten</a>) + <a href=/index.php?term=-ise&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>-ise</a>, though this would be early for such a native formation. The form of
the modern word is not easily accounted for [OED]. Related: Chastised; chastising.  <blockquote>He
alone may chastise who loves. [Rabindranath Tagore, The Crescent Moon, 1913]</blockquote>
