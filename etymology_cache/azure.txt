azure (n.)

early 14c., from Old French azur, asur, a color name, from a false separation of Arabic
(al)-lazaward lapis lazuli, as though the -l- were the French article l'. The Arabic name is from
Persian lajward, from Lajward, a place in Turkestan, mentioned by Marco Polo, where the stone was
collected.
