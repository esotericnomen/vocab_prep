defer (v.1)

to delay, late 14c., differren, deferren, from Old French differer (14c.), from Latin differre carry
apart, scatter, disperse; also be different, differ; also defer, put off, postpone, (see differ).
Etymologically identical with differ; the spelling and pronunciation differentiated from 15c.,
perhaps partly by association of this word with delay.
