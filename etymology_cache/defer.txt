to delay, late 14c., differren, deferren, from Old French differer (14c.), from Latin differre carry
apart, scatter, disperse; also be different, differ; also defer, put off, postpone, (see <a
href=/index.php?term=differ&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>differ</a>). Etymologically
identical with differ; the spelling and pronunciation differentiated from 15c., perhaps partly by
association of this word with delay.
