1802, from French surveillance oversight, supervision, a watch, noun of action from surveiller
oversee, watch (17c.), from sur- over (see <a href=/index.php?term=sur-&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>sur-</a> (1)) + veiller to watch, from Latin vigilare, from vigil watchful (see
<a href=/index.php?term=vigil&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>vigil</a>). Seemingly a
word that came to English from the Terror in France (surveillance committees were formed in every
French municipality in March 1793 by order of the Convention to monitor the actions and movements of
suspect persons, outsiders, and dissidents).
