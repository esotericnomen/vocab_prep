surveillance (n.)

1802, from French surveillance oversight, supervision, a watch, noun of action from surveiller
oversee, watch (17c.), from sur- over (see sur- (1)) + veiller to watch, from Latin vigilare, from
vigil watchful (see vigil). Seemingly a word that came to English from the Terror in France
(surveillance committees were formed in every French municipality in March 1793 by order of the
Convention to monitor the actions and movements of suspect persons, outsiders, and dissidents).
