phenomenal (adj.)

1803, of the nature of a phenomenon, a hybrid from phenomenon + -al (1). Meaning remarkable,
exceptional is from 1850.    [Phenomenal] is a metaphysical term with a use of its own. To divert it
from this proper use to a job for which it is not needed, by making it do duty for remarkable,
extraordinary, or prodigious, is a sin against the English language. [Fowler]    Related:
Phenomenally.


phenomenalism (n.)

1865 (John Grote), from phenomenal + -ism. Related: Phenomenalist.


ping-pong (n.)

1900, as Ping-Pong, trademark for table tennis equipment (Parker Brothers). Both words are imitative
of the sound of the ball hitting a hard surface; from ping + pong (attested from 1823). It had a
phenomenal vogue in U.S. c.1900-1905.
