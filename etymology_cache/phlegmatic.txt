phlegmatic (adj.)

cool, calm, self-possessed, and in a more pejorative sense, cold, dull, apathetic, 1570s, from
literal sense abounding in phlegm (as a bodily humor) (mid-14c., fleumatik), from Old French
fleumatique (13c., Modern French flegmatique), from Late Latin phlegmaticus, from Greek phlegmatikos
abounding in phlegm (see phlegm).A verry flewmatike man is in the body lustles, heuy and slow. [John
of Trevisa, translation of Bartholomew de Glanville's De proprietatibus rerum, 1398]


temperament (n.)

late 14c., proportioned mixture of elements, from Latin temperamentum proper mixture, a mixing in
due proportion, from temperare to mix (see temper (v.)). In medieval theory, it meant a combination
of qualities (hot, cold, moist, dry) that determined the nature of an organism; thus also a
combination of the four humors (sanguine, choleric, phlegmatic, and melancholic) that made up a
person's characteristic disposition. General sense of habit of mind, natural disposition is from
1821.
