pinch (n.)

late 15c., critical juncture (as in baseball pinch hitter, attested from 1912), from pinch (v.).
This figurative sense is attested earlier than the literal sense of act of pinching (1590s) or that
of small quantity (as much as can be pinched between a thumb and finger), which is from 1580s. There
is a use of the noun from mid-15c. apparently meaning fold or pleat of fabric.
