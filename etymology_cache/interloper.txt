1590s, enterloper, unauthorized trader trespassing on privileges of chartered companies, probably a
hybrid from <a href=/index.php?term=inter-&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>inter-</a>
between + -loper (from landloper vagabond, adventurer, also, according to Johnson, a term of
reproach used by seamen of those who pass their lives on shore); perhaps a dialectal form of <a

loper runner, rover, from lopen to run, from Proto-Germanic *hlaupan to leap (see <a
href=/index.php?term=leap&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>leap</a> (v.)). General sense
of self-interested intruder is from 1630s.
