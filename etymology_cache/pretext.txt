1510s, from French pr&#233;texte, from Latin praetextum a pretext, outward display, noun use of
neuter past participle of praetexere to disguise, cover, literally weave in front (for sense,
compare pull the wool over (someone's) eyes); from prae- in front (see pre-) + texere to weave, from
PIE root *teks- to weave, to make (see texture (n.)).


causation (n.)

1640s, from Latin causationem (nominative causatio) excuse, pretext, in Medieval Latin action of
causing, from causa (see cause).


cozen (v.)

1560s, of uncertain origin; perhaps from French cousiner cheat on pretext of being a cousin; or from
Middle English cosyn fraud, trickery (mid-15c.), which is perhaps related to Old French co&ccedil;on
dealer, merchant, trader, from Latin cocionem horse dealer. Related: Cozened; cozening; cozenage.

of circumstances.
