1610s, from French decrier (14c.; Old French descrier cry out, announce), from de- down, out (see <a
href=/index.php?term=de-&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>de-</a>) + crier to cry, from
Latin quiritare (see <a href=/index.php?term=cry&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>cry</a>
(v.)). In English, the sense has been colored by the presumption that de- in this word means down.
