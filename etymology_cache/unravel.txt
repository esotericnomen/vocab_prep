Dictionary]. Related: Unravelled; unravelling; unravellment.

c.1825, to unravel (of clothing), from East Anglian variant of 17c. fasel to unravel, fray (as the
end of a rope), from Middle English facelyn to fray (mid-15c.), from fasylle fringe, frayed edge,

ravel (v.)

1580s, to untangle, disentangle, unwind (originally with out), also to entangle, become tangled or
confused, from Dutch ravelen to tangle, fray, rafelen to unweave, from rafel frayed thread. The
seemingly contradictory senses of this word (ravel and unravel are both synonyms and antonyms) are
reconciled by its roots in weaving and sewing: as threads become unwoven, they get tangled.
