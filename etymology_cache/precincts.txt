carrel (n.)

1590s, study in a cloister, from Medieval Latin carula small study in a cloister, which is of
unknown origin; perhaps from Latin corolla little crown, garland, used in various senses of ring
(for example, a c.1330 description of Stonehenge: &thorn;is Bretons renged about &thorn;e feld,
&thorn;e karole of &thorn;e stones beheld); extended to precincts and spaces enclosed by rails, etc.
Specific sense of private cubicle in a library is from 1919.


banlieue (n.)

French, suburbs, precincts, from Vulgar Latin *banleuca, from ban (see ban (n.1)) + leuca a league
(of distance), in Medieval Latin, indefinite extent of territory (see league (n.2)). So, the extent
of a ban; the territory within which a ban is of force, hence, territory subject to one
jurisdiction.


mulatto (n.)

1590s, offspring of a European and a black African, from Spanish or Portuguese mulato of mixed
breed, literally young mule, from mulo mule, from Latin mulus (fem. mula) mule (see mule (n.1));
possibly in reference to hybrid origin of mules. As an adjective from 1670s. Fem. mulatta is
attested from 1620s; mulattress from 1805.    American culture, even in its most rigidly segregated
precincts, is patently and irrevocably composite. It is, regardless of all the hysterical
protestations of those who would have it otherwise, incontestibly mulatto. Indeed, for all their
traditional antagonisms and obvious differences, the so-called black and so-called white people of
the United States resemble nobody else in the world so much as they resemble each other. [Albert
Murray, The Omni-Americans: Black Experience &amp; American Culture, 1970]    Old English had
sunderboren born of disparate parents.
