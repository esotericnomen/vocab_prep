1766, allege to be of unsound mind (legal term), from Late Latin stultificare turn into foolishness,
from Latin stultus foolish (literally uneducated, unmovable, from PIE root *stel- to put, stand) +
root of facere to make (see <a href=/index.php?term=factitious&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>factitious</a>). The first element is cognate with Latin stolidus slow, dull,
obtuse (see <a href=/index.php?term=stolid&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>stolid</a>).
Meaning cause to appear foolish or absurd is from 1809. Hence stultiloquy foolish talk, silly
babbling (1650s). Related: Stultified; stultifying.
