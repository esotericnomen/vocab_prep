stultify (v.)

1766, allege to be of unsound mind (legal term), from Late Latin stultificare turn into foolishness,
from Latin stultus foolish (literally uneducated, unmovable, from PIE root *stel- to put, stand) +
root of facere to make (see factitious). The first element is cognate with Latin stolidus slow,
dull, obtuse (see stolid). Meaning cause to appear foolish or absurd is from 1809. Hence stultiloquy
foolish talk, silly babbling (1650s). Related: Stultified; stultifying.
