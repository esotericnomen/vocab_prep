Orion

bright constellation, late 14c., from Greek Oarion, name of a giant in Greek mythology, loved by
Aurora, slain by Artemis, of unknown origin, though some speculate on Akkadian Uru-anna the Light of
Heaven. Another Greek name for the constellation was Kandaon, a title of Ares, god of war, and the
star pattern is represented in many cultures as a giant (such as Old Irish Caomai the Armed King,
Old Norse Orwandil, Old Saxon Ebu&eth;rung).
