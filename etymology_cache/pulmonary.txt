pulmonary (adj.)

1704, from French pulmonaire and directly from Latin pulmonarius of the lungs, from pulmo (genitive
pulmonis) lung, cognate with Greek pleumon lung, Old Church Slavonic plusta, Lithuanian plauciai
lungs, all from PIE *pleu- to flow, to float, to swim (see pluvial).    The notion perhaps is from
the fact that, when thrown into a pot of water, lungs of a slaughtered animal float, while the
heart, liver, etc., do not (compare Middle English lights the lungs, literally the light (in weight)
organs). Also see pneumo-.
