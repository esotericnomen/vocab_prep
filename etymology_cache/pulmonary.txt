1704, from French pulmonaire and directly from Latin pulmonarius of the lungs, from pulmo (genitive
pulmonis) lung, cognate with Greek pleumon lung, Old Church Slavonic plusta, Lithuanian plauciai
lungs, all from PIE *pleu- to flow, to float, to swim (see <a
href=/index.php?term=pluvial&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>pluvial</a>).  <br /><br />
The notion perhaps is from the fact that, when thrown into a pot of water, lungs of a slaughtered
animal float, while the heart, liver, etc., do not (compare Middle English <a
href=/index.php?term=lights&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>lights</a> the lungs,
literally the light (in weight) organs). Also see <a
