pulmonary (adj.)

1704, from French pulmonaire and directly from Latin pulmonarius of the lungs, from pulmo (genitive
pulmonis) lung, cognate with Greek pleumon lung, Old Church Slavonic plusta, Lithuanian plauciai
lungs, all from PIE *pleu- to flow, to float, to swim (see pluvial).    The notion perhaps is from
the fact that, when thrown into a pot of water, lungs of a slaughtered animal float, while the
heart, liver, etc., do not (compare Middle English lights the lungs, literally the light (in weight)
organs). Also see pneumo-.


cardiopulmonary (adj.)

1908, from cardio- + pulmonary.


consumptive (adj.)

early 15c., wasteful, also with reference to pulmonary consumption, from Latin consumpt-, stem of
consumere (see consume) + -ive. As a noun, attested from late 14c.


pneumonia (n.)

c.1600, from Modern Latin, from Greek pneumonia inflammation of the lungs, from pneumon lung,
altered (perhaps by influence of pnein to breathe) from pleumon lung, literally floater, probably
cognate with Latin pulmo (see pulmonary), from PIE *pleu- to flow, to swim (see pluvial). Alteration
in Greek perhaps by influence of pnein to breathe.


lung (n.)

human respiratory organ, c.1300, from Old English lungen (plural), from Proto-Germanic *lungw-
(cognates: Old Norse lunge, Old Frisian lungen, Middle Dutch longhe, Dutch long, Old High German
lungun, German lunge lung), literally the light organ, from PIE *legwh- not heavy, having little
weight; easy, agile, nimble (cognates: Russian l&#235;gkij, Polish lekki light; Russian l&#235;gkoje
lung, Greek elaphros light in weight; see also lever).    The notion probably is from the fact that,
when thrown into a pot of water, lungs of a slaughtered animal float, while the heart, liver, etc.,
do not. Compare also Portuguese leve lung, from Latin levis light; Irish scaman lungs, from scaman
light; Welsh ysgyfaint lungs, from ysgafn light. See also lights, pulmonary. Lung cancer attested
from 1882.
