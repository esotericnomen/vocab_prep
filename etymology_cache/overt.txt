overt (adj.)

early 14c., open to view, from Old French overt (Modern French ouvert), past participle of ovrir to
open, from Latin aperire to open, uncover, from PIE compound *ap-wer-yo- from *ap- off, away (see
abo-) + base *wer- (5) to cover (see weir). Compare Latin operire to cover, from the same root with
PIE prefix *op- over; and Lithuanian atveriu open, uzveriu shut.
