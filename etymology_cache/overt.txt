early 14c., open to view, from Old French overt (Modern French ouvert), past participle of ovrir to
open, from Latin aperire to open, uncover, from PIE compound *ap-wer-yo- from *ap- off, away (see <a
href=/index.php?term=abo-&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>abo-</a>) + base *wer- (5) to
cover (see <a href=/index.php?term=weir&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>weir</a>).
Compare Latin operire to cover, from the same root with PIE prefix *op- over; and Lithuanian atveriu
open, uzveriu shut.
