grandiose (adj.)

1828 (earlier as a French word in English), from French grandiose impressive (18c.), from Italian
grandioso, from Latin grandis big (see grand (adj.)). Related: Grandiosely.


grandiosity (n.)

1814, from French grandiose (see grandiose) + -ity.    The author now and then makes a word for his
own use, as complicate, for complicated; and, still less fortunately 'grandiosity' (p. 343). [review
of Joseph Forsyth's Remarks on Italy, Edinburgh Review, January 1814]
