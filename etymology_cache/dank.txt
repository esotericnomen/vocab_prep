dank (adj.)

c.1400, earlier as a verb (early 14c.), now obsolete, meaning to moisten, used of mists, dews, etc.
Perhaps from Scandinavian (compare Swedish dank moist place, d&auml;nka to moisten) or German
(compare Middle High German damph, Dutch damp vapor). Now largely superseded by damp (adj.).
Related: Dankness.
