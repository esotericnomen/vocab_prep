luminary (n.)

mid-15c., lamp, source of (artificial) light, from Old French luminarie (12c.), lamp, lights,
lighting; candles; brightness, illumination, from Late Latin luminare light, torch, lamp, heavenly
body, literally that which gives light, from Latin lumen (genitive luminis) light, related to lucere
to shine (see light (n.)). Sense of notable person is first recorded 1690s, though the Middle

Ethiop

late 14c., from Latin &AElig;thiops Ethiopian, negro, from Greek Aithiops, perhaps from aithein to
burn + ops face (compare aithops fiery-looking, later sunburned).Who the Homeric &AElig;thiopians
were is a matter of doubt. The poet elsewhere speaks of two divisions of them, one dwelling near the
rising, the other near the setting of the sun, both having imbrowned visages from their proximity to
that luminary, and both leading a blissful existence, because living amid a flood of light; and, as
a natural concomitant of a blissful existence, blameless, and pure, and free from every kind of
moral defilement. [Charles Anthon, note to The First Six Books of Homer's Iliad, 1878]
