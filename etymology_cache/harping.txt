harp (v.)

Old English hearpian; see harp (n.). Cognate with Middle Dutch, Dutch harpen, Middle High German
harpfen, German harfen. Figurative sense of talk overmuch (about something) first recorded mid-15c.,
originally to harp upon one string. Related: Harped; harping.


harpoon (n.)

1610s, from French harpon, from Old French harpon cramp iron, clamp, clasp (described as a mason's
tool for fastening stones together), from harper to grapple, grasp, possibly of Germanic origin; or
from Latin harpa- hook (related to harpagonem grappling hook), from Greek harpe sickle, from PIE
root *serp- (1) sickle, hook. Earlier harping-iron (mid-15c.). Sense and spelling perhaps influenced
by Dutch (Middle Dutch harpoen) or Basque, the language of the first whaling peoples, who often
accompanied English sailors on their early expeditions. Also see -oon.
