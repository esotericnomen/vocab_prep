wiggle (v.)

early 13c., perhaps from Middle Dutch or Middle Flemish wigelen, frequentative of wiegen to rock,
from wiege cradle, from Proto-Germanic *wig- (cognates: Old High German wiga, German Wiege cradle,
Old Frisian widze), from PIE root *wegh- to move (see weigh). Related: Wiggled; wiggling. The noun
is attested from 1816.


polliwog (n.)

tadpole, mid-15c., polwygle, probably from pol head (see poll (n.)) + wiglen to wiggle (see wiggle
(v.)). Modern spelling is 1830s, replacing earlier polwigge.


wiggly (adj.)

1878, from wiggle (n.) + -y (2).


earwig (n.)

(Forficula auricularia), Old English earwicga, from eare (see ear (n.1)) + wicga beetle, worm,
probably related to wiggle. So called from the ancient and widespread (but false) belief that the
garden pest went into people's ears. Compare French perce-oreille, German ohr-wurm. A Northern
England name for it reported from 1650s is twitch-ballock.
