faun (n.)

late 14c., from Latin Faunus, a word of unknown origin. A god of the countryside, worshipped
especially by farmers and shepherds, equivalent of Greek Pan. Formerly men with goat horns and
tails, later with goat legs, which caused them to be assimilated to satyrs, but they have diverged
again lately.    The faun is now regarded rather as the type of unsophisticated &amp; the satyr of
unpurified man; the first is man still in intimate communion with Nature, the second is man still
swayed by bestial passions. [Fowler]    The plural is fauni.

in which satisfaction is sought through channels other than those of normal heterosexual intercourse
is from 1892, originally including homosexuality.Perversions are defined as unnatural acts, acts
contrary to nature, bestial, abominable, and detestable. Such laws are interpretable only in
accordance with the ancient tradition of the English common law which ... is committed to the
doctrine that no sexual activity is justifiable unless its objective is procreation. [A.C. Kinsey,
et.al., Sexual Behavior in the Human Male, 1948]
