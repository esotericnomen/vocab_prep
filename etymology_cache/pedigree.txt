pedigree (n.)

early 15c., genealogical table or chart, from Anglo-French pe de gru, a variant of Old French pied
de gru foot of a crane, from Latin pedem accusative of pes foot (see foot (n.)) + gruem (nominative
grus) crane, cognate with Greek geranos, Old English cran; see crane (n.)).    On old manuscripts,
descent was indicated by a forked sign resembling the branching lines of a genealogical chart; the
sign also happened to look like a bird's footprint. Form influenced in Middle English by association
with degree. Meaning ancestral line is mid-15c.; of animals, c.1600. Related: Pedigreed.
