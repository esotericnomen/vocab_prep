pedigree (n.)

early 15c., genealogical table or chart, from Anglo-French pe de gru, a variant of Old French pied
de gru foot of a crane, from Latin pedem accusative of pes foot (see foot (n.)) + gruem (nominative
grus) crane, cognate with Greek geranos, Old English cran; see crane (n.)).    On old manuscripts,
descent was indicated by a forked sign resembling the branching lines of a genealogical chart; the
sign also happened to look like a bird's footprint. Form influenced in Middle English by association
with degree. Meaning ancestral line is mid-15c.; of animals, c.1600. Related: Pedigreed.


ap- (2)

patronymic prefix in Welsh names, earlier map son, cognate with Gaelic mac. Since 17c. merged into
surnames (Ap Rhys = Price, Ap Evan = Bevan, etc.).    It is said that a Welshman who evidently was
not willing to be surpassed in length of pedigree, when making out his genealogical tree, wrote near
the middle of his long array of 'aps' -- about this time Adam was born. [Origin and Significance of
our Names, The Chautauquan, Oct. 1887-July 1888]


branch (n.)

c.1300, braunch, limb of a tree (also used of things analogous to it, especially geographic
features), from Old French branche branch, bough, twig; branch of a family (12c.), from Late Latin
branca footprint, later a claw, paw, of unknown origin, probably from Gaulish. The connecting notion
would be the shape (compare pedigree). Replaced native bough. Meaning local office of a business is
first recorded 1817, from earlier sense of component part of a system (1690s).


genealogy (n.)

early 14c., line of descent, pedigree, descent, from Old French genealogie (12c.), from Late Latin
genealogia tracing of a family, from Greek genealogia, from genea generation, descent (see genus) +
-logia (see -logy). An Old English word for it was folctalu, literally folk tale. Meaning study of
family trees is from 1768.
