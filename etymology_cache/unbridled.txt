late 14c., originally in figurative sense of unrestrained, ungoverned, from <a
href=/index.php?term=un-&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>un-</a> (1) not + bridled (see
<a href=/index.php?term=bridle&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>bridle</a> (v.)). Similar
formation in Middle Dutch ongebreidelt. Literal sense of not fitted with a bridle (of horses) is not
recorded before 1550s. The verb unbridle (see <a href=/index.php?term=un-&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>un-</a> (2)) is attested from c.1400 in the literal sense; mid-15c. in the
figurative sense.
