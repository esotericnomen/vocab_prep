unbridled (adj.)

late 14c., originally in figurative sense of unrestrained, ungoverned, from un- (1) not + bridled
(see bridle (v.)). Similar formation in Middle Dutch ongebreidelt. Literal sense of not fitted with
a bridle (of horses) is not recorded before 1550s. The verb unbridle (see un- (2)) is attested from
c.1400 in the literal sense; mid-15c. in the figurative sense.
