1755, from Latinized form of Greek komat-, comb. form of koma (genitive komatos; see <a
href=/index.php?term=coma&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>coma</a>) + <a
href=/index.php?term=-ose&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>-ose</a> (1). Perhaps
immediately from French comateux. Transferred sense of lethargic is from 1828.
