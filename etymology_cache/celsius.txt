calorie (n.)

1866, from French calorie, from Latin calor (genitive caloris) heat, from PIE *kle-os-, suffixed
form of root *kele- (1) warm (cognates: Latin calidus warm, calere be hot; Sanskrit carad- harvest,
literally hot time; Lithuanian silti become warm, silus August; Old Norse hl&aelig;r, Old English
hleow warm).    In scientific use, largely replaced 1950 by the joule. As a unit of energy, defined
as heat required to raise 1 gram of water 1 degree Celsius (the small or gram calorie), but also as
heat required to raise 1 kilogram of water 1 degree Celsius (the large calorie or kilocalorie).


hydrophobia (n.)

late 14c., idroforbia, a symptom of rabies in man (sometimes used for the disease itself), from Late
Latin hydrophobia (Celsius, 50 C.E.), from Greek hydrophobos dreading water, from hydr-, stem of
hydros water (see water (n.1)) + phobos dread, fear (see phobia). So called because human sufferers
show aversion to water and have difficulty swallowing it. In Old English as w&aelig;terfyrhtness.
