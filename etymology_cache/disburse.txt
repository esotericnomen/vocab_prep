disbursement (n.)

1590s; see disburse + -ment.


disburse (v.)

1520s, disbourse, from Old French desbourser (13c.) extract (money) from a purse, spend (money),
from des- (see dis-) + bourse purse (see bursar). Related: Disbursed; disbursing.


shell (v.)

1560s, to remove (a nut, etc.) from a shell, from shell (n.). The meaning to bombard with shells is
first attested 1856. To shell out disburse (1801) is a figurative use from the image of extracting
nuts. Related: Shelled; shelling.


dispense (v.)

early 14c., from Old French dispenser give out (13c.), from Latin dispensare disburse, administer,
distribute (by weight), frequentative of dispendere pay out, from dis- out (see dis-) + pendere to
pay, weigh (see pendant).    In Medieval Latin, dispendere was used in the ecclesiastical sense of
grant license to do what is forbidden or omit what is required (a power of popes, bishops, etc.),
and thus acquired a sense of grant remission from punishment or exemption from law, hence to do away
with (1570s), do without (c.1600). Older sense is preserved in dispensary. Related: Dispensed;
dispensing.
