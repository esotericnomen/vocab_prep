crevice (n.)

mid-14c., from Old French crevace (12c., Modern French crevasse) gap, rift, crack (also, vulgarly,
the female pudenda), from Vulgar Latin *crepacia, from Latin crepare to crack, creak (see raven);
meaning shifted from the sound of breaking to the resulting fissure.


crevasse (n.)

1823, of glaciers; 1814, of riverbanks (in that case from Louisiana French), from French crevasse,
from Old French crevace crevice (see crevice). Essentially the same word as crevice, but re-adopted
in senses for which the meaning that had taken hold in crevice was felt to be too small.


crayfish (n.)

small, freshwater lobster, early 14c., crevis, from Old French crevice crayfish (13c., Modern French
&eacute;crevisse), probably from Frankish *krebitja or a similar Germanic word that is a diminutive
form of the root of crab (n.1); compare Old High German krebiz crab, shellfish, German Krebs. Modern
spelling is 16c., under influence of fish (n.).


cranky (adj.)

cross-tempered, irritable, 1807, from crank (n.) + -y (2). The evolution would be from earlier
senses of crank, such as a twist or fanciful turn of speech (1590s); inaccessible hole or crevice
(1560s). Grose's 1787 Provincial Glossary has Cranky. Ailing sickly from the dutch crank, sick, and
identifies it as a Northern word. Jamieson's Scottish dictionary (1825) has crank in a secondary
sense of hard, difficult, as in crank word, a word hard to be understood; crank job, a work attended
with difficulty, or requiring ingenuity in the execution. Related: Crankily; crankiness.   Ben. Dang
it, don't you spare him--A cross grain'd cranky toad as ever crawl'd. (etc.) [Richard Cumberland,
Lovers Resolutions, Act I, 1813]
