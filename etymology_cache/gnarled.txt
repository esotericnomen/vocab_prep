gnarled (adj.)

the source of the group of words that includes gnarl (v.), gnarl (n.), gnarly is Shakespeare's use
of gnarled in 1603:    Thy sharpe and sulpherous bolt Splits the vn-wedgable and gnarled Oke.
[Measure for Measure, II.ii.116]    OED and Barnhart call it a variant of knurled, from Middle
English knar knot in wood (late 14c.), originally a rock, a stone; of uncertain origin. (Gnarled)
occurs in one passage of Shakes. (for which the sole authority is the folio of 1623), whence it came
into general use in the nineteenth century [OED].
