benedict (n.)

newly married man (especially one who had seemed a confirmed bachelor), 1821, from the character
Benedick in Much Ado About Nothing (1599). The name is from Late Latin Benedictus, literally
blessed, from Latin benedicte bless (you) (see benediction). This also produced the proper name
Bennet; hence also benet (late 14c.), the third of the four lesser orders of the Roman Catholic
Church, one of whose functions was to exorcize spirits.
