vitiate (v.)

1530s, from Latin vitiatus, past participle of vitiare to make faulty, injure, spoil, corrupt, from
vitium fault, defect, blemish, crime, vice (see vice (n.1)). Related: Vitiated; vitiating.


vitiation (n.)

1630s, from Latin vitiationem (nominative vitiatio) violation, corruption, noun of action from past
participle stem of vitiare (see vitiate).


suffragette (n.)

female supporter of the cause of women's voting rights, 1906, from suffrage, with French fem. ending
-ette, but not in the sense in which it was in vogue at the time.   <b>suffragette</b>. A more
regrettable formation than others such as leaderette &amp; flannelette, in that it does not even
mean a sort of suffrage as they mean a sort of leader &amp; of flannel, &amp; therefore tends to
vitiate the popular conception of the termination's meaning. The word itself may now be expected to
die, having lost its importance; may its influence on word-making die with it! [Fowler, 1926]
Compare suffragist.
