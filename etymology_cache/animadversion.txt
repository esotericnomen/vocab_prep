animadversion (n.)

1590s, criticism, blame, also sometimes in early use simply notice, attention (now obsolete), from
Latin animadversionem (nominative animadversio) investigation, inquiry; perception, observation,
noun of action from past participle stem of animadverte to take cognizance of, literally to turn the
mind to, from animum, accusative of animus mind (see animus), + advertere to turn to (see
advertise). The sense of to take notice of as a fault was in Latin; in fact animadverto at times was
a euphemism for to punish with death.
