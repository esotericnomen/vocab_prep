sonnet (n.)

1557 (in title of Surrey's poems), from Middle French sonnet (1540s) or directly from Italian
sonetto, literally little song, from Old Proven&ccedil;al sonet song, diminutive of son song, sound,
from Latin sonus sound (see sound (n.1)).    Originally in English also any short lyric poem;
precise meaning is from Italian, where Petrarch (14c.) developed a scheme of an eight-line stanza
(rhymed abba abba) followed by a six-line stanza (cdecde, the Italian sestet, or cdcdcd, the
Sicilian sestet). Shakespeare developed the English Sonnet for his rhyme-poor native tongue: three
Sicilian quatrains followed by a heroic couplet (ababcdcdefefgg). The first stanza sets a situation
or problem, and the second comments on it or resolves it.
