timorous (adj.)

early 15c., from Middle French timoureus (14c.), from Medieval Latin timorosus fearful, from Latin
timor fear, dread, apprehension, anxiety; religious awe, reverence, from timere to fear, be afraid,
dread, of unknown origin. Some early senses in English seem to show confusion with Middle English
temerous rash (see temerity). Related: Timorously; timorousness.


shadow (n.)

Old English sceadwe, sceaduwe the effect of interception of sunlight, dark image cast by someone or
something when interposed between an object and a source of light, oblique cases (to the, from the,
of the, in the) of sceadu (see shade (n.)). Shadow is to shade (n.) as meadow is to mead (n.2).
Similar formation in Old Saxon skado, Middle Dutch schaeduwe, Dutch schaduw, Old High German scato,
German schatten, Gothic skadus shadow, shade.    From mid-13c. as darkened area created by shadows,
shade. From early 13c. in sense anything unreal; mid-14c. as a ghost; late 14c. as a foreshadowing,
prefiguration. Meaning imitation, copy is from 1690s. Sense of the faintest trace is from 1580s;
that of a spy who follows is from 1859.    As a designation of members of an opposition party chosen
as counterparts of the government in power, it is recorded from 1906. Shadow of Death (c.1200)
translates Vulgate umbra mortis (Ps. xxiii:4, etc.), which itself translates Greek skia thanatou,
perhaps a mistranslation of a Hebrew word for intense darkness. In Beowulf, Gendel is a sceadugenga,
a shadow-goer, and another word for darkness is sceaduhelm. To be afraid of one's (own) shadow be
very timorous is from 1580s.
