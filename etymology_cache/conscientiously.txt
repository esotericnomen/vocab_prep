conscientious (adj.)

1610s, from Middle French conscientieux (16c.; Modern French consciencieux), from Medieval Latin
conscientiosus, from conscientia (see conscience). Related: Conscientiously; conscientiousness.


jumbo (adj.)

very large, unusually large for its type, 1882, a reference to Jumbo, name of the London Zoo's huge
elephant (acquired from France, said to have been captured as a baby in Abyssinia in 1861), sold
February 1882 to U.S. circus showman P.T. Barnum amid great excitement in America and great outcry
in England, both fanned by Barnum. The name is perhaps from slang jumbo clumsy, unwieldy fellow
(1823), which itself is possibly from a word for elephant in a West African language (compare Kongo
nzamba).    I tell you conscientiously that no idea of the immensity of the animal can be formed. It
is a fact that he is simply beyond comparison. The largest elephants I ever saw are mere dwarfs by
the side of Jumbo. [P.T. Barnum, interview, Philadelphia Press, April 22, 1882]    As a product
size, by 1886 (cigars). Jumbo jet attested by 1964.
