toll (n.)

tax, fee, Old English toll impost, tribute, passage-money, rent, variant of toln, cognate with Old
Norse tollr, Old Frisian tolen, Old High German zol, German Zoll, probably representing an early
Germanic borrowing from Late Latin tolonium custom house, from Latin telonium tollhouse, from Greek
teloneion tollhouse, from telones tax-collector, from telos tax (see tele-; for sense, compare
finance). On the other theory it is native Germanic and related to tell (v.) on the notion of that
which is counted. Originally in a general sense of payment exacted by an authority; meaning charge
for right of passage along a road is from late 15c.
