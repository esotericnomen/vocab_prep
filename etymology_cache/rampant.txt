late 14c., standing on the hind legs (as a heraldic lion often does), thus, also, fierce, ravenous
(late 14c.), from Old French rampant, present participle of ramper to climb, scale, mount (see <a
href=/index.php?term=rampage&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>rampage</a> (v.)). Sense of
growing without check (in running rampant), first recorded 1610s, probably is via the notion of
fierce disposition or else preserves the older French sense.
