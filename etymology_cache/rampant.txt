rampant (adj.)

late 14c., standing on the hind legs (as a heraldic lion often does), thus, also, fierce, ravenous
(late 14c.), from Old French rampant, present participle of ramper to climb, scale, mount (see
rampage (v.)). Sense of growing without check (in running rampant), first recorded 1610s, probably
is via the notion of fierce disposition or else preserves the older French sense.
