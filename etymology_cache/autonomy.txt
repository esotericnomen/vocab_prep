enlightenment (n.)

1660s, action of enlightening, from enlighten + -ment. Used only in figurative sense, of spiritual
enlightenment, etc. Attested from 1865 as a translation of German Aufkl&auml;rung, a name for the
spirit and system of Continental philosophers in the 18c.The philosophy of the Enlightenment
insisted on man's essential autonomy: man is responsible to himself, to his own rational interests,
to his self-development, and, by an inescapable extension, to the welfare of his fellow man. For the
philosophes, man was not a sinner, at least not by nature; human nature -- and this argument was
subversive, in fact revolutionary, in their day -- is by origin good, or at least neutral. Despite
the undeniable power of man's antisocial passions, therefore, the individual may hope for
improvement through his own efforts -- through education, participation in politics, activity in
behalf of reform, but not through prayer. [Peter Gay, The Enlightenment]
