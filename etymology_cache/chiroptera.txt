bat (n.2)

flying mammal (order Chiroptera), 1570s, a dialectal alteration of Middle English bakke (early
14c.), which is probably related to Old Swedish natbakka, Old Danish nathbakk&aelig; night bat, and
Old Norse le&eth;rblaka leather flapper, so original sense is likely flapper. The shift from -k- to
-t- may have come through confusion of bakke with Latin blatta moth, nocturnal insect.    Old
English word for the animal was hreremus, from hreran to shake (see rare (adj.2)), and rattle-mouse
is attested from late 16c., an old dialectal word for bat. As a contemptuous term for an old woman,
perhaps a suggestion of witchcraft (compare fly-by-night), or from bat as prostitute who plies her
trade by night [Farmer, who calls it old slang and finds French equivalent night swallow (hirondelle
de nuit) more poetic].
