1848, from jettison (n.) act of throwing overboard to lighten a ship. This noun was an 18c. Marine
Insurance writers' restoration of the earlier form and original sense of the 15c. word that had
become <a href=/index.php?term=jetsam&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>jetsam</a>,
probably because jetsam had taken on a sense of things cast overboard and an unambiguous word was
needed for act of throwing overboard.  <br /><br />  Middle English jetteson (n.) act of throwing
overboard is from Anglo-French getteson, from Old French getaison act of throwing (goods overboard),
especially to lighten a ship in distress, from Late Latin iactionem (nominative iactatio) act of
throwing, noun of action from past participle stem of iectare toss about (see <a
href=/index.php?term=jet&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>jet</a> (v.)). Related:
