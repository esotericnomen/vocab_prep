jettison (v.)

1848, from jettison (n.) act of throwing overboard to lighten a ship. This noun was an 18c. Marine
Insurance writers' restoration of the earlier form and original sense of the 15c. word that had
become jetsam, probably because jetsam had taken on a sense of things cast overboard and an
unambiguous word was needed for act of throwing overboard.    Middle English jetteson (n.) act of
throwing overboard is from Anglo-French getteson, from Old French getaison act of throwing (goods
overboard), especially to lighten a ship in distress, from Late Latin iactionem (nominative
iactatio) act of throwing, noun of action from past participle stem of iectare toss about (see jet
(v.)). Related: Jettisoned.


jetsam (n.)

1560s, jottsome act of throwing goods overboard to lighten a ship, alteration and contraction of
Middle English jetteson, from Anglo-French getteson, Old French getaison a throwing (see jettison).
Intermediate forms were jetson, jetsome; the form perhaps was deformed by influence of flotsam. From
1590s as goods thrown overboard; figurative use by 1861. For distinction of meaning, see flotsam.
