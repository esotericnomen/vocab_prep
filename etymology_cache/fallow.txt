c.1300, from Old English fealh fallow land, from Proto-Germanic *falgo (cognates: Old High German
felga harrow, German Felge plowed-up fallow land, East Frisian falge fallow, falgen to break up
ground), perhaps from a derivation of PIE root *pel- (3) to turn, fold. Assimilated in English to
fallow (adj.) because of the color of plowed earth. Originally plowed land, then land plowed but not
planted (1520s). As an adjective, from late 14c.
