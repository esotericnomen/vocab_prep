gnome (n.)

dwarf-like earth-dwelling spirit, 1712, from French gnome, from Modern Latin gnomus, used 16c. in a
treatise by Paracelsus, who gave the name pigmaei or gnomi to elemental earth beings, possibly from
Greek *genomos earth-dweller (compare thalassonomos inhabitant of the sea). A less-likely suggestion
is that Paracelsus based it on the homonym that means intelligence (preserved in gnomic). Popular in
children's literature 19c. as a name for red-capped German and Swiss folklore dwarfs. Garden
figurines first imported to England late 1860s from Germany.


gnomic (adj.)

full of instructive sayings, 1815, from French gnomique (18c.) and directly from Late Latin gnomicus
concerned with maxims, didactic, from Greek gnomikos, from gnome thought, opinion, maxim,
intelligence, from root of gignoskein to come to know (see gnostic). English gnome meant short,
pithy statement of general truth (1570s). Gnomical is attested from 1610s.


gnomish (adj.)

1822, from gnome + -ish. Related: Gnomishly; gnomishness.

creature, demon, German Wicht creature, little child, Old Norse vettr thing, creature, Swedish
v&auml;tte spirit of the earth, gnome, Gothic waihts something), from PIE *wekti- thing, creature
