gnome (n.)

dwarf-like earth-dwelling spirit, 1712, from French gnome, from Modern Latin gnomus, used 16c. in a
treatise by Paracelsus, who gave the name pigmaei or gnomi to elemental earth beings, possibly from
Greek *genomos earth-dweller (compare thalassonomos inhabitant of the sea). A less-likely suggestion
is that Paracelsus based it on the homonym that means intelligence (preserved in gnomic). Popular in
children's literature 19c. as a name for red-capped German and Swiss folklore dwarfs. Garden
figurines first imported to England late 1860s from Germany.
