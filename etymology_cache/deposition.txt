deposition (n.)

late 14c., dethronement, putting down from dignity or authority, from Old French deposicion (12c.),
from Latin depositionem (nominative depositio), noun of action from past participle stem of deponere
(see deposit (v.)).    Meaning statements made in court under oath is from early 15c. Meaning action
of depositing is from 1590s. Properly, deposition belongs to deposit, but deposit and depose have
become totally confused and English deposition partakes of senses belonging to both.
