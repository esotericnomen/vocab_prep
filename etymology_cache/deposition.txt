deposition (n.)

late 14c., dethronement, putting down from dignity or authority, from Old French deposicion (12c.),
from Latin depositionem (nominative depositio), noun of action from past participle stem of deponere
(see deposit (v.)).    Meaning statements made in court under oath is from early 15c. Meaning action
of depositing is from 1590s. Properly, deposition belongs to deposit, but deposit and depose have
become totally confused and English deposition partakes of senses belonging to both.


deponent (adj.)

1520s, originally grammatical (of verbs passive in form but active in sense), from Latin deponentem
putting down or aside, present participle of deponere (see deposit (v.)). Noun meaning one who makes
a deposition is from 1540s.


tale (n.)

Old English talu series, calculation, also story, tale, statement, deposition, narrative, fable,
accusation, action of telling, from Proto-Germanic *talo (cognates: Dutch taal speech, language,
Danish tale speech, talk, discourse, German Erz&#228;hlung story, Gothic talzjan to teach), from PIE
root *del- (2) to recount, count. The secondary Modern English sense of number, numerical reckoning
(c.1200) probably was the primary one in Germanic; see tell (v.), teller and Old Frisian tale,
Middle Dutch tal, Old Saxon tala, Danish tal, Old High German zala, German Zahl number.    The
ground sense of the Modern English word in its main meaning, then, might have been an account of
things in their due order. Related to talk (v.) and tell (v.). Meaning things divulged that were
given secretly, gossip is from mid-14c.; first record of talebearer tattletale is late 15c.
