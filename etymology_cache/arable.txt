arable (adj.)

early 15c., suitable for plowing (as opposed to pasture- or wood-land), from Old French arable
(12c.), from Latin arabilis, from arare to plow, from PIE *are- to plow (cognates: Greek aroun, Old
Church Slavonic orja, Lithuanian ariu to plow; Gothic arjan, Old English erian, Middle Irish airim,
Welsh arddu to plow; Old Norse ar&thorn;r a plow). Replaced by late 18c. native erable, from Old
English erian to plow, from the same PIE source.
