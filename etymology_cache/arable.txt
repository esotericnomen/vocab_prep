arable (adj.)

early 15c., suitable for plowing (as opposed to pasture- or wood-land), from Old French arable
(12c.), from Latin arabilis, from arare to plow, from PIE *are- to plow (cognates: Greek aroun, Old
Church Slavonic orja, Lithuanian ariu to plow; Gothic arjan, Old English erian, Middle Irish airim,
Welsh arddu to plow; Old Norse ar&thorn;r a plow). By late 18c. it replaced native erable, from Old
English erian to plow, from the same PIE source.


gain (n.)

late 15c., from Middle French gain, from Old French gaaigne gain, profit, advantage; booty; arable
land (12c.), from gaaignier to gain (see gain (v.)). The original French sense enfolded the notions
of profit from agriculture and booty, prey. Implied earlier in Middle English gaignage (late 14c.)
profit from agriculture.
