Pelops and Niobe, punished in the afterlife (for an offense variously given) by being made to stand

tantalum (n.)

metallic element, 1809, Modern Latin, named 1802 by its discoverer, Swedish chemist Anders Ekberg
(1767-1813), for Tantalus, according to Ekberg partly because of its inability to absorb acid
recalled Tantalus' punishment in the afterlife (see tantalize). Sometimes it is said to be so called
from the difficulty scientists faced in obtaining a pure specimen.

Tantalus

Greek Tantalos, king of Phrygia, perhaps literally the Bearer or the Sufferer, by dissimilation from
*tal-talos, a reduplication of PIE root *tele- to bear, carry, support (see extol), in reference to
his long endurance, but Watkins finds this unlikely. Compare tantalize.
