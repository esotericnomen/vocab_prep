statutory (adj.)

pertaining to statues, depending on statute for authority, required by statute, 1717, from statute +
-ory. Statutory rape attested from 1873; in U.S., sexual intercourse with a female below the legal
age of consent, whether forced or not. Related: Statutorily.


jail (n.)

late 13c., gayhol, from Old North French gaiole and Old French jaole, both meaning a cage, prison,
from Medieval Latin gabiola, from Late Latin caveola, diminutive of Latin cavea cage, enclosure,
stall, coop (see cave (n.)). Both forms carried into Middle English; now pronounced jail however it
is spelled. Persistence of Norman-derived gaol (preferred in Britain) is chiefly due to statutory
and official tradition [OED].
