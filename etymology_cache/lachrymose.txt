1660s, tear-like, from Latin lacrimosus tearful, sorrowful, weeping, also causing tears, lamentable,
from lacrima tear, a dialect-altered borrowing of Greek dakryma tear, from dakryein to shed tears,
from dakry tear, from PIE *dakru- (see <a href=/index.php?term=tear&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>tear</a> (n.1)). Meaning given to tears, tearful is first attested 1727;
meaning of a mournful character is from 1822.  <br /><br />  The -d- to -l- alteration in Latin is
the so-called Sabine -L-; compare Latin olere smell, from root of <a

Latin form of Greek Odysseus. The Medieval Latin practice of writing -ch- for -c- before Latin -r-

pedantic, from belief in a Greek origin. Middle English had lacrymable tearful (mid-15c.).
