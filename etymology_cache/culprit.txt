culprit (n.)

1670s, from Anglo-French cul prit, contraction of Culpable: prest (d'averrer nostre bille) guilty,
ready (to prove our case), words used by prosecutor in opening a trial. It seems the abbreviation
cul. prit was mistaken in English for an address to the defendant.


inconvenient (adj.)

late 14c., injurious, dangerous, from Old French inconv&eacute;nient (13c.), from Latin
inconvenientem (nominative inconveniens) unsuitable, not accordant, dissimilar, from in- not,
opposite of (see in- (1)) + convenientem (see convenient). In early 15c., inappropriate, unbecoming,
unnatural; also, of an accused person, unlikely as a culprit, innocent. Sense of troublesome,
awkward first recorded 1650s.
