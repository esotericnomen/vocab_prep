shoddy (adj.)

1862, having a delusive appearance of high quality, a Northern word from the American Civil War in
reference to the quality of government supplies for the armies, from earlier noun meaning rag-wool,
wool made of woolen waste and old rags (1832), perhaps a Yorkshire provincial word, of uncertain
origin.    Originally used for padding, English manufacturers began making coarse wearing clothes
from it, and when new it looked like broad-cloth but the gloss quickly wore off, giving the stuff a
bad reputation as a cheat. The 1860 U.S. census of manufactures notes import of more than 6 million
pounds of it, which was much used in the manufacture of army and navy cloths and blankets in the
United States according to an 1865 government report.  <blockquote>  The Days of Shoddy, as the
reader will readily anticipate, are the opening months of the present war, at which time the
opprobrious name first came into general use as a designation for swindling and humbug of every
character; and nothing more need be said to indicate the scope of this novel. [Henry Morford, The
Days of Shoddy: A Novel of the Great Rebellion in 1861, Philadelphia, 1863]  </blockquote>  Related:
