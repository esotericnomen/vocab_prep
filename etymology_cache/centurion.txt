centurion (n.)

late 13c., from Latin centurionem (nominative centurio), Roman army officer, head of a centuria (a
group of one hundred); see century.


Latin (adj.)

Old English latin, from Latin Latinus belonging to Latium, the region of Italy around Rome, possibly
from PIE root *stela- to spread, extend, with a sense of flat country (as opposed to the mountainous
district of the Sabines), or from a prehistoric non-IE language. The Latin adjective also was used
of the Roman language and people.   <b>Centurion:</b> What's this, then? â&euro;&tilde;People
called Romanes they go the house?â&euro;&trade;  <b>Brian:</b> It ... it says,
â&euro;&tilde;Romans, go home.â&euro;&trade;  <b>Centurion</b> [thrashing him like a schoolboy]:
No, it doesn't. â&euro;&tilde;Go home?' This is motion towards. Isn't it, boy?  <b>Brian:</b> Ah
... ah, dative, sir! Ahh! No, not dative! Not the dative, sir! No! Ah! Oh, the ... accusative!
Domum, sir! Ah! Oooh! Ah!  <b>Centurion</b> [pulling him by the ear]: Except that domum takes the
...?  <b>Brian:</b> The locative, sir!  [Monty Python, Life of Brian]    Used as a designation for
people whose languages descend from Latin (1856), hence Latin America (1862). The Latin Quarter
(French Quartier latin) of Paris, on the south (left) bank of the Seine, was the site of university
buildings in the Middle Ages, hence the place where Latin was spoken. The surname Latimer,
Lattimore, etc. is from Vulgar Latin latimarus, from Latin latinarius interpreter, literally a
speaker of Latin.


lounge (v.)

to loll idly, c.1500, Scottish, of uncertain origin, perhaps [Barnhart] from French s'allonger
(paresseusement) to lounge about, lie at full length, from Old French alongier lengthen, from Latin
longus long (see long (adj.)). Another etymology traces it through obsolete lungis (n.) slow, lazy
person (c.1560), from Middle French longis, a generic application of Longinus, supposed to be the
name of the centurion who pierced Christ's side with a spear in John xix:34. Popular etymology
associated the name directly with long (adj.). Related: Lounged; lounging.


century (n.)

1530s, one hundred (of anything), from Latin centuria group of one hundred of things of one kind
(including a measure of land and a division of the Roman army, one-sixteenth of a legion, headed by
a centurion), from centum hundred (see hundred) on analogy of decuria a company of ten.    Used in
Middle English from late 14c. as a division of land, from Roman use. The Modern English meaning is
attested from 1650s, short for century of years (1620s). The older, general sense is preserved in
the meaning score of 100 points in cricket and some other sports. Related: Centurial.
