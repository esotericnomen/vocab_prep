characterized by slaughter, 1620s, possibly from French sanguinaire, or directly from Latin
sanguinarius pertaining to blood, from sanguis (genitive sanguinis) blood, of unknown origin. Latin
distinguished sanguis, the generic word, from cruor blood from a wound. The latter word is related
to Greek kreas meat, Sanskrit kravis- raw flesh, Old English hreaw- raw (see <a
