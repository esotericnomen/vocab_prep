mercurial (adj.)

late 14c., pertaining to the planet Mercury (see Mercury). Meaning sprightly, volatile, quick
(1590s) is from supposed qualities of those born under the planet Mercury (they also are the
qualities of the god Mercury), probably also partly by association with the qualities of
quicksilver. A variant in this sense was mercurious (1590s). Related: Mercurially; mercuriality.
