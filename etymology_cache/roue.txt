roue (n.)

debauchee, 1800, from French rou&eacute; dissipated man, rake, originally past participle of Old
French rouer to break on the wheel (15c.), from Latin rotare roll (see rotary). Said to have been
first applied in French c.1720 to dissolute friends of the Duke of Orleans (regent of France
1715-23), to suggest the punishment they deserved; but probably rather from a secondary, figurative
sense in French of jaded, worn out, from the notion of broken, run-over, beat down.
