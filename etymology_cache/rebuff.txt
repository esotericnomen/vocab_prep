chaturanga four members of an army -- elephants, horses, chariots, foot soldiers. This is preserved
in Spanish ajedrez, from Arabic (al) shat-ranj, from Persian chatrang, from the Sanskrit word.The
chess pieces are the block alphabet which shapes thoughts; and these thoughts, although making a
visual design on the chessboard, express their beauty abstractly, like a poem. [Marcel Duchamp,
address to New York State Chess Association, Aug. 30, 1952]
