1620s, declare, express, from Latin enuntiatus, past participle of enuntiare speak out, say,
express, assert; divulge, disclose, reveal, betray, from ex- out (see <a
href=/index.php?term=ex-&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>ex-</a>) + nuntiare to announce
(see <a href=/index.php?term=nuncio&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>nuncio</a>). Or
perhaps a back-formation from enunciation. Meaning to articulate, pronounce is from 1759. Related:
