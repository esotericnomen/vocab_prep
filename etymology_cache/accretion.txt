accretion (n.)

1610s, from Latin accretionem (nominative accretio) an increasing, a growing larger (as of the
waxing moon), noun of action from past participle stem of accrescere, from ad- to (see ad-) +
crescere grow (see crescent).


accrue (v.)

mid-15c., from Old French acreue growth, increase, what has grown, fem. of acreu, past participle of
acreistre (Modern French accro&icirc;tre) to increase, from Latin accrescere (see accretion).
Related: Accrued; accruing. Apparently a verb from a French noun because there is no English verb to
go with it until much later, unless the record is defective.
