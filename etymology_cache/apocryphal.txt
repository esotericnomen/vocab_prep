apocryphal (adj.)

1580s, of doubtful authenticity, from Apocrypha + -al (1). Middle English had apocrive (late 14c.)
in same sense.


Elmo

of St. Elmo's Fire (for which see saint (n.)); probably from Greek elene torch, via an apocryphal
saint.


garter (n.)

early 14c., from Old North French gartier band just above or below the knee (Old French jartier,
14c., Modern French jarreti&egrave;re), from garet bend of the knee, perhaps from Gaulish (compare
Welsh garr leg). Garter as the highest order of knighthood (mid-14c.), according to Froissart was
established c.1344 by Edward III, though the usual story of how it came about is late (1614) and
perhaps apocryphal. The verb is mid-15c., from the noun. Garter snake (U.S.) so called from
resemblance to a ribbon. Garter belt first noticed 1913.


macabre (adj.)

early 15c., originally in reference to a kind of morality show or allegorical representation of
death and his victims, from Old French (danse) Macabr&eacute; (dance) of Death (1376), of uncertain
origin, probably a translation of Medieval Latin (Chorea) Machab&aelig;orum, literally dance of the
Maccabees (leaders of the Jewish revolt against Syro-Hellenes; see Maccabees). The association with
the dance of death seems to be from vivid descriptions of the martyrdom of the Maccabees in the
Apocryphal books. The abstracted sense of gruesome is first attested 1842 in French, 1889 in
English.    The typical form which the allegory takes is that of a series of pictures, sculptured or
painted, in which Death appears, either as a dancing skeleton or as a shrunken corpse wrapped in
grave-clothes to persons representing every age and condition of life, and leads them all in a dance
to the grave. [Encyclopaedia Britannica, 11th ed., 1911]
