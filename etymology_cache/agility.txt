agility (n.)

early 15c., from Old French agilit&eacute; (14c.), from Latin agilitatem (nominative agilitas)
mobility, nimbleness, quickness, from agilis, from agere to move (see act (n.)).


trapeze (n.)

swing with a cross-bar, used for feats of strength and agility, 1861, from French trap&egrave;ze,
from Late Latin trapezium (see trapezium), probably because the crossbar, the ropes and the ceiling
formed a trapezium.    The French, to whose powers of invention (so long as you do not insist upon
utility) there is no limit, have invented for the world the Trapeze .... [Chambers's Journal, July
6, 1861]


blarney (n.)

1796, from Blarney Stone (which is said to make a persuasive flatterer of any who kiss it), in a
castle near Cork, Ireland. As Bartlett explains it, the reason is the difficulty of the feat of
kissing the stone where it sits high up in the battlement: to have ascended it, was proof of
perseverence, courage, and agility, whereof many are supposed to claim the honor who never achieved
the adventure. So to have kissed the Blarney Stone came to mean to tell wonderful tales [Dictionary
of Americanisms, 1848]. The word reached wide currency through Lady Blarney, the smooth-talking
flatterer in Goldsmith's Vicar of Wakefield (1766). As a verb from 1803.
