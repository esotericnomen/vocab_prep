enormity (n.)

late 15c., transgression, crime, irregularity, from Old French &eacute;normit&eacute; extravagance,
enormity, atrocity, heinous sin, from Latin enormitatem (nominative enormitas) hugeness, vastness,
irregularity, from enormis (see enormous). Meaning extreme wickedness in English attested from
1560s; sense of hugeness (1792) is etymological but probably best avoided to prevent
misunderstanding.
