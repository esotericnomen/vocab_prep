late 15c., transgression, crime, irregularity, from Old French &eacute;normit&eacute; extravagance,
enormity, atrocity, heinous sin, from Latin enormitatem (nominative enormitas) hugeness, vastness,
irregularity, from enormis (see <a href=/index.php?term=enormous&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>enormous</a>). Meaning extreme wickedness in English attested from 1560s; sense
of hugeness (1792) is etymological but probably best avoided to prevent misunderstanding.
