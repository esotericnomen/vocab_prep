enormity (n.)

late 15c., transgression, crime, irregularity, from Old French &eacute;normit&eacute; extravagance,
enormity, atrocity, heinous sin, from Latin enormitatem (nominative enormitas) hugeness, vastness,
irregularity, from enormis (see enormous). Meaning extreme wickedness in English attested from
1560s; sense of hugeness (1792) is etymological but probably best avoided to prevent
misunderstanding.


enormous (adj.)

1530s, from Latin enormis out of rule, irregular, shapeless; extraordinary, very large, from ex- out
of (see ex-) + norma rule, norm (see norm), with English -ous substituted for Latin -is.    Meaning
extraordinary in size is attested from 1540s; original sense of outrageous is more clearly preserved
in enormity. Earlier in same sense was enormyous (mid-15c.). Related: Enormously.
