eclat (n.)

1670s, showy brilliance, from French &eacute;clat splinter, fragment (12c.), also flash of
brilliance, from eclater burst out, splinter, from Old French esclater smash, shatter into pieces,
of uncertain origin, perhaps from a West Germanic word related to slit or to Old High German sleizen
tear to pieces; to split, cleave. Extended sense of conspicuous success is first recorded in English
in 1741.
