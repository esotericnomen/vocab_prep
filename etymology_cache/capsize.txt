capsize (v.)

1780 (transitive); 1792 (intransitive), a nautical word of obscure origin, perhaps (as Skeat
suggests) from Spanish capuzar to sink by the head, from cabo head, from Latin caput (see
capitulum). For sense, compare French chavirer to capsize, upset, faire capot capsize;
Proven&ccedil;al cap virar to turn the head. Related: Capsized; capsizing.


upset (v.)

mid-15c., to set up, fix, from up (adv.) + set (v.). Similar formation in Middle Dutch opsetten set
up, propose, German aufsetzen. Modern sense of overturn, capsize (1803) is that of obsolete overset.
In reference to the stomach, from 1834. Meaning to throw into mental discomposure is from 1805.
Related: Upsetting.
