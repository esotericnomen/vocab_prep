1780 (transitive); 1792 (intransitive), a nautical word of obscure origin, perhaps (as Skeat
suggests) from Spanish capuzar to sink by the head, from cabo head, from Latin caput (see <a
href=/index.php?term=capitulum&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>capitulum</a>). For
sense, compare French chavirer to capsize, upset, faire capot capsize; Proven&ccedil;al cap virar to
turn the head. Related: Capsized; capsizing.
