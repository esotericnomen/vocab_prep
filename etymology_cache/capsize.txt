capsize (v.)

1780 (transitive); 1792 (intransitive), a nautical word of obscure origin, perhaps (as Skeat
suggests) from Spanish capuzar to sink by the head, from cabo head, from Latin caput (see
capitulum). For sense, compare French chavirer to capsize, upset, faire capot capsize;
Proven&ccedil;al cap virar to turn the head. Related: Capsized; capsizing.
