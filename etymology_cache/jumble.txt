jumble (n.)

a confused mixture, 1660s, from jumble (v.).


jumble (v.)

1520s, originally to move confusedly, perhaps coined on model of stumble, tumble, etc. In 17c., it
was yet another euphemism for have sex with (a sense first attested 1580s). Meaning mix or confuse
is from 1540s. Related: Jumbled; jumbling.


bilingual (adj.)

1818, from bi- + lingual. Latin bilinguis meant literally two-tongued, and, figuratively, speaking a
jumble of languages, also double-tongued, hypocritical, false.


balderdash (n.)

1590s, of unknown origin; originally a jumbled mix of liquors (milk and beer, beer and wine, etc.),
transferred 1670s to senseless jumble of words. From dash; first element perhaps cognate with Danish
balder noise, clatter (see boulder).


mess (n.)

c.1300, food for one meal, pottage, from Old French mes portion of food, course at dinner, from Late
Latin missus course at dinner, literally a placing, a putting (on a table, etc.), from past
participle of mittere to put, place, in classical Latin to send, let go (see mission).    Meaning
communal eating place (especially a military one) is first attested 1530s, from earlier sense of
company of persons eating together (early 15c.), originally a group of four. Sense of mixed food,
especially for animals, (1738) led to contemptuous use for jumble, mixed mass (1828) and figurative
sense of state of confusion (1834), as well as condition of untidiness (1851). General use for a
quantity of anything is attested by 1830. Meaning excrement (of animals) is from 1903.
