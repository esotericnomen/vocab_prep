die (v.)

mid-12c., possibly from Old Danish d&oslash;ja or Old Norse deyja to die, pass away, both from
Proto-Germanic *dawjan (cognates: Old Frisian deja to kill, Old Saxon doian, Old High German touwen,
Gothic diwans mortal), from PIE root *dheu- (3) to pass away, die, become senseless (cognates: Old
Irish dith end, death, Old Church Slavonic daviti, Russian davit' to choke, suffer).    It has been
speculated that Old English had *diegan, from the same source, but it is not in any of the surviving
texts and the preferred words were steorfan (see starve), sweltan (see swelter), wesan dead, also
for&eth;gan and other euphemisms.    Languages usually don't borrow words from abroad for central
life experiences, but die words are an exception, because they are often hidden or changed
euphemistically out of superstitious dread. A Dutch euphemism translates as to give the pipe to
Maarten. Regularly spelled dege through 15c., and still pronounced dee by some in Lancashire and
Scotland. Used figuratively (of sounds, etc.) from 1580s. Related: Died; dies.
