burgeon (v.)

early 14c., grow, sprout, blossom, from Anglo-French burjuner, Old French borjoner to bud, sprout,
from borjon a bud, shoot, pimple (Modern French bourgeon), of uncertain origin. Perhaps from Vulgar
Latin *burrionem (nominative *burrio), from Late Latin burra flock of wool, itself of uncertain
origin. Some sources (Kitchin, Gamillscheg) say either the French word or the Vulgar Latin one is
from Germanic. The English verb is perhaps instead a native development from burjoin (n.) a bud
(c.1300), from Old French. Related: Burgeoned; burgeoning.


orgasm (n.)

1680s, sexual climax, from French orgasme or Modern Latin orgasmus, from Greek orgasmos excitement,
swelling, from organ be in heat, become ripe for, literally to swell, be excited, related to orge
impulse, excitement, anger, from PIE root *wrog- to burgeon, swell with strength (cognates: Sanskrit
urja a nourishment, sap, vigor, Old Irish ferc, ferg anger). Also used 17c. of other violent
excitements of emotion or other bodily functions.
