hoedown (n.)

noisy dance, 1841, apparently originally the name of a specific dance, perhaps from perceived
parallel of dance motions to those of farm chores, hence from hoe (n.).    The step of every negro
dance that was ever known, was called into requisition and admirably executed. They performed the
double shuffle, the Virginny break-down, the Kentucky heeltap, the pigeon wing, the back balance
lick, the Arkansas hoe down, with unbounded applause and irresistible effect. [Scouting Expeditions
of McCulloch's Texas Rangers, 1848]    Hoe corn, hill tobacco is noted as a line in the chorus of a
slave song in 1838, and Washington Irving writes of a dance called hoe corn and dig potatoes in
1807.    The same precedence is repeated until all the merchandise is disposed of, the table is then
banished the room, and the whole party hoe it down in straight fours and set dances, till the hour
when ghosts wandering here and there, troop home to church-yards. This is what we kintra folk call a
strauss. [Der Teufelskerl. A Tale of German Pennsylvania, in Burton's Gentleman's Magazine, January
1840]
