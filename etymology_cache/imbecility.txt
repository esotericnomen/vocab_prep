early 15c., physical weakness, feebleness (of a body part), impotence, from Middle French
imb&eacute;cillit&eacute; and directly from Latin imbecillitatem (nominative imbecillitas) weakness,
feebleness, from imbecillus weak, feeble, traditionally said to mean unsupported (quasi sine
baculo), from assimilated form of in- not, opposite of (see <a
href=/index.php?term=in-&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>in-</a> (1)) + baculum a stick
(see <a href=/index.php?term=bacillus&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>bacillus</a>).
Weakness in mind (as opposed to body) was a secondary sense in Latin but was not attested in English
until 1620s.
