imbecility (n.)

early 15c., physical weakness, feebleness (of a body part), impotence, from Middle French
imb&eacute;cillit&eacute; and directly from Latin imbecillitatem (nominative imbecillitas) weakness,
feebleness, from imbecillus weak, feeble, traditionally said to mean unsupported (quasi sine
baculo), from assimilated form of in- not, opposite of (see in- (1)) + baculum a stick (see
bacillus). Weakness in mind (as opposed to body) was a secondary sense in Latin but was not attested
in English until 1620s.
