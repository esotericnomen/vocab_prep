brow (n.)

early 14c., browes, brues brow, forehead, eyebrow, earlier brouwes (c. 1300), bruwen (c. 1200), from
Old English bru, probably originally eyebrow, but extended to eyelash, then eyelid by association of
the hair of the eyebrow with the hair of the eyelid, the eyebrows then becoming Old English oferbrua
overbrows (early Middle English uvere breyhes or briges aboue &thorn;e eiges).    The general word
for eyebrow in Middle English was  brew, breowen (c. 1200), from Old English br&aelig;w (West
Saxon), *brew (Anglian), from Proto-Germanic *br&aelig;wi- blinker, twinkler (cognates: Old Frisian
bre, Old Saxon brawa, Middle Dutch brauwe eyelid, Old High German brawaeyebrow, Old Norse bra
eyebrow, Gothic brahw twinkle, blink, in phrase in brahwa augins in the twinkling of an eye).    Old
English bru is from Proto-Germanic *brus- eyebrow (source also of Old Norse brun), from PIE *bhru-
eyebrow (cognates: Sanskrit bhrus eyebrow, Greek ophrys, Old Church Slavonic bruvi, Lithuanian
bruvis brow, Old Irish bru edge). The -n- in the Old Norse (brun) and German (braune) forms of the
word are from a genitive plural inflection.    Words for eyelid, eyelash, and eyebrow changed about
maddeningly in Old and Middle English (and in all the West Germanic languages). By 1530s, brow had
been given an extended sense of forehead, especially with reference to movements and expressions
that showed emotion or attitude.
