c.1400, having power to control fate, from wierd (n.), from Old English wyrd fate, chance, fortune;
destiny; the Fates, literally that which comes, from Proto-Germanic *wurthiz (cognates: Old Saxon
wurd, Old High German wurt fate, Old Norse ur&eth;r fate, one of the three Norns), from PIE *wert-
to turn, to wind, (cognates: German werden, Old English weor&eth;an to become), from root *wer- (3)
to turn, bend (see <a href=/index.php?term=versus&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>versus</a>). For sense development from turning to becoming, compare phrase
turn into become.  <br /><br />  The sense uncanny, supernatural developed from Middle English use
of weird sisters for the three fates or Norns (in Germanic mythology), the goddesses who controlled
human destiny. They were portrayed as odd or frightening in appearance, as in Macbeth (and
especially in 18th and 19th century productions of it), which led to the adjectival meaning odd-
looking, uncanny (1815); odd, strange, disturbingly different (1820). Related: Weirdly; weirdness.
