recumbent (adj.)

1705, from Latin recumbentem (nominative recumbens), present participle of recumbere recline, lie
down, lie down again; of things, to fall, sink down, settle down, from re- back (see re-) + -cumbere
to lie down (see succumb). Related: Recumbency (1640s). A verb, recumb, has been attempted in
English occasionally since 1670s.


recline (v.)

early 15c., from Old French recliner rest, lay; bend, lean over (13c.) and directly from Latin
reclinare to bend back, to lean back; cause to lean, from re- back, against (see re-) + clinare to
bend, from PIE *klei-n-, suffixed form of *klei to lean (see lean (v.)). Related: Reclined;
reclining.   Recline is always as strong as lean, and generally stronger, indicating a more
completely recumbent position, and approaching lie. [Century Dictionary]
