allocate (v.)

1630s, from verbal used of adjective allocate (mid-15c. in legal use), from Medieval Latin allocate
(the common first word of writs authorizing payment), imperative plural of allocare allocate, from
Latin ad- to (see ad-) + locare to place (see locate). Related: Allocated; allocating.


re-allocate (v.)

also reallocate, by 1868, from re- + allocate. Related: Reallocated; reallocating.


allocation (n.)

mid-15c., from Middle French allocacion, from Medieval Latin allocationem (nominative allocatio),
noun of action from past participle stem of allocare (see allocate).


allow (v.)

early 14c., allouen, to commend, praise; approve of, be pleased with; appreciate the value of; also,
take into account or give credit for, also, in law and philosophy, recognize, admit as valid (a
privilege, an excuse, a statement, etc.). From late 14c. as sanction or permit; condone; in business
use from early 15c.    The Middle English word is from Anglo-French alouer, Old French aloer,
alloiier (13c.) allot, apportion, bestow, assign, from Latin allocare (see allocate). This word in
Old French was confused and ultimately merged with aloer; alloer to praise, commend, from Latin
allaudare, adlaudare, compound of ad- to (see ad-) + laudare to praise (see laud). From the first
word came the sense preserved in allowance as money granted; from the second came its meaning
permission based on approval.    Between the two primary significations there naturally arose a
variety of uses blending them in the general idea of assign with approval, grant, concede a thing
claimed or urged, admit a thing offered, permit, etc., etc. [OED].    Related: Allowed; allowing.
