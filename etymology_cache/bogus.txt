1838, counterfeit money, spurious coin, American English, apparently from a slang word applied
(according to some sources first in Ohio in 1827) to a counterfeiter's apparatus.  <blockquote>  One
bogus or machine impressing dies on the coin, with a number of dies, engraving tools, bank bill
paper, spurious coin, &amp;c.; &amp;c.; making in all a large wagon load, was taken into possession
by the attorney general of Lower Canada. [Niles' Register, Sept. 7, 1833, quoting from Concord, New
Hampshire, Statesman, Aug. 24]  </blockquote>   Some trace this to tantrabobus, also tantrabogus, a
late 18c. colloquial Vermont word for any odd-looking object, in later 19c. use the devil, which
might be connected to tantarabobs, recorded as a Devonshire name for the devil. Others trace it to
the same source as <a href=/index.php?term=bogey&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
