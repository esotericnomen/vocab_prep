gargoyle (n.)

grotesque carved waterspout, late 13c., gargurl, from Old French gargole throat, waterspout (see
gargle).


baboon (n.)

type of old world ape, c.1400, babewyn, earlier a grotesque figure used in architecture or
decoration (early 14c.), from French babouin baboon, from Old French baboin ape, earlier simpleton,
dimwit, fool (13c.), also gaping figure (such as a gargoyle), so perhaps from Old French baboue
grimacing; or perhaps it is imitative of the ape's babbling speech-like cries. Also see -oon. German
Pavian baboon is from Dutch baviaan, from Middle Dutch baubijn, a borrowing of the Old French word.
Century Dictionary says Arabic maimun probably is from the European words.
