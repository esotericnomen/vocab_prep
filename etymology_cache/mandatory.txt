mandatory (adj.)

1570s, of the nature of a mandate, from Late Latin mandatorius pertaining to a mandator, from Latin
mandatus, past participle of mandare (see mandate (n.)). Sense of obligatory because commanded is
from 1818.


conscientious objector (n.)

1896, in reference to those with religious scruples about mandatory vaccination. Military sense
predominated from World War I.    After a chequered career full of startling episodes and reversals,
the Vaccination Bill becomes virtually the Vaccination Act. In Parliament the hottest of the contest
centred round the conscientious objector. [The Lancet, Aug. 13, 1898]
