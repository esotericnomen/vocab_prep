unscathed (adj.)

late 14c., from un- (1) not + past participle of scathe (v.). Mainly in Scottish before 19c. Similar
formation in Old Norse osta&eth;a&eth;r, Swedish oskadad.


scathe (v.)

c.1200, from Old Norse ska&eth;a to hurt, harm, damage, injure, from Proto-Germanic *skath-
(cognates: Old English scea&thorn;ian to hurt, injure, Old Saxon skathon, Old Frisian skethia,
Middle Dutch scaden, Dutch schaden, Old High German scadon, German schaden, Gothic sca&thorn;jan to
injure, damage), from PIE root *sket- to injure. Only cognate outside Germanic seems to be in Greek
a-skethes unharmed, unscathed.    It survives mostly in its negative form, unscathed, and in
figurative meaning sear with invective or satire (1852, usually as scathing) which developed from
the sense of scar, scorch used by Milton in Paradise Lost i.613 (1667).


safe (adj.)

c.1300, unscathed, unhurt, uninjured; free from danger or molestation, in safety, secure; saved
spiritually, redeemed, not damned; from Old French sauf protected, watched-over; assured of
salvation, from Latin salvus uninjured, in good health, safe, related to salus good health, saluber
healthful, all from PIE *solwos from root *sol- whole (cognates: Latin solidus solid, Sanskrit
sarvah uninjured, intact, whole, Avestan haurva- uninjured, intact, Old Persian haruva-, Greek holos
whole).    As a quasi-preposition from c.1300, on model of French and Latin cognates. From late 14c.
as rescued, delivered; protected; left alive, unkilled. Meaning not exposed to danger (of places) is
attested from late 14c.; of actions, etc., free from risk, first recorded 1580s. Meaning sure,
reliable, not a danger is from c.1600. Sense of conservative, cautious is from 1823. Paired
alliteratively with sound (adj.) from late 14c. The noun safe-conduct (late 13c.) is from Old French
sauf-conduit (13c.).
