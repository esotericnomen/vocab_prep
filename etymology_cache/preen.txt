preen (v.)

to trim, to dress up, late 14c., perhaps a variation of Middle English proynen, proinen trim the
feather with the beak (see prune (v.)); or perhaps from Old French poroindre anoint before, and Old
French proignier round off, prune. Middle English prene (from Old English preon, a general Germanic
word) meant to pin, and probably influenced the form of this word. Watkins, however, connects it
with Latin unguere to smear, anoint.    Because of the popularity of falconry, bird activities
formerly were more closely observed and words for them were more precise in English than today.Youre
hawke proynith and not pikith and she prenyth not bot whan she begynnyth at hir leggys, and fetcheth
moystour like oyle at hir taill. [Book of St. Albans, 1486]


prune (v.)

early 15c., prouyne, from Old French proignier cut back (vines), prune (Modern French provigner), of
unknown origin. Perhaps [Watkins] from Gallo-Roman *pro-retundiare cut in a rounded shape in front,
from pro- forth (see pro-) + *retundiare round off, from Latin rotundus (see round (adj.)). Klein
suggests the Old French word is from provain layer of a vine, from Latin propago (see prop (n.1)).
Or the Middle English word might be identical with the falconry term proinen, proynen trim the
feather with the beak (late 14c.), source of preen [Barnhart]. Related: Pruned; pruning. Pruning
hook is from 1610s; pruning knife from 1580s.
