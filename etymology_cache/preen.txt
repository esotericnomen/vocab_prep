to trim, to dress up, late 14c., perhaps a variation of Middle English proynen, proinen trim the
feather with the beak (see <a href=/index.php?term=prune&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>prune</a> (v.)); or perhaps from Old French poroindre anoint before, and Old
French proignier round off, prune. Middle English prene (from Old English preon, a general Germanic
word) meant to pin, and probably influenced the form of this word. Watkins, however, connects it
with Latin unguere to smear, anoint.  <br /><br />  Because of the popularity of falconry, bird
activities formerly were more closely observed and words for them were more precise in English than
today.<blockquote>Youre hawke proynith and not pikith and she prenyth not bot whan she begynnyth at
hir leggys, and fetcheth moystour like oyle at hir taill. [Book of St. Albans, 1486]</blockquote>
