ravel (n.)

1630s, a tangle; 1832, a broken thread, from ravel (v.).


ravel (v.)

1580s, to untangle, disentangle, unwind (originally with out), also to entangle, become tangled or
confused, from Dutch ravelen to tangle, fray, rafelen to unweave, from rafel frayed thread. The
seemingly contradictory senses of this word (ravel and unravel are both synonyms and antonyms) are
reconciled by its roots in weaving and sewing: as threads become unwoven, they get tangled.


unravel (v.)

c.1600 (transitive), from un- (2) + ravel (v.). Intransitive from 1640s. The prefix is either
reversive or intensive, according as ravel is taken to mean 'tangle' or 'untangle' [Century
Dictionary]. Related: Unravelled; unravelling; unravellment.
