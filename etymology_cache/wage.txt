wage (v.)

c.1300, give (something) as surety, deposit as a pledge, from Old North French wagier to pledge (Old
French gagier, to pledge, guarantee, promise; bet, wager, pay, Modern French gager), from wage (see
wage (n.)). Meaning to carry on, engage in (of war, etc.) is attested from mid-15c., probably from
earlier sense of to offer as a gage of battle, agree to engage in combat (mid-14c.). Related: Waged;
waging.
