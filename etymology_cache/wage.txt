c.1300, give (something) as surety, deposit as a pledge, from Old North French wagier to pledge (Old
French gagier, to pledge, guarantee, promise; bet, wager, pay, Modern French gager), from wage (see
<a href=/index.php?term=wage&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>wage</a> (n.)). Meaning to
carry on, engage in (of war, etc.) is attested from mid-15c., probably from earlier sense of to
offer as a gage of battle, agree to engage in combat (mid-14c.). Related: Waged; waging.
