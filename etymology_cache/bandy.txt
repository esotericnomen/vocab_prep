1570s, to strike back and forth, from Middle French bander, from root of <a
href=/index.php?term=band&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>band</a> (n.2). The sense
apparently evolved from join together to oppose, to opposition itself, to exchanging blows, then
metaphorically, to volleying in tennis. Bandy (n.) was a 17c. Irish game, precursor of field hockey,
played with curved a stick (also called a bandy), hence bandy-legged (1680s).
