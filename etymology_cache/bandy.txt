bandy (v.)

1570s, to strike back and forth, from Middle French bander, from root of band (n.2). The sense
apparently evolved from join together to oppose, to opposition itself, to exchanging blows, then
metaphorically, to volleying in tennis. Bandy (n.) was a 17c. Irish game, precursor of field hockey,
played with curved a stick (also called a bandy), hence bandy-legged (1680s).


sambo (n.1)

person of mixed blood in America and Asia, 1748, perhaps from Spanish zambo bandy-legged, probably
from Latin scambus bow-legged, from Greek skambos. Used variously in different regions to indicate
some mixture of African, European, and Indian blood; common senses were child of black and Indian
parentage and offspring of a black and a mulatto.


valgus (adj.)

deformity in which a bone or joint is twisted outward from the center of the body; form of club-
foot, 1800, from Latin valgus bandy-legged, bow-legged, having the legs bent outward. Said to be
probably related to Sanskrit valgati to move up and down, Old English wealcan to roll, move to and
fro (see walk (v.)), perhaps on the notion of go irregularly or to and fro [Tucker]. Yet the main
characteristic of 'bow-legged' is the crookedness of the legs, not 'going up and down' or 'to and
fro' [de Vaan] and there are phonetic difficulties. A classical word used in a different sense in
modern medicine; also see varus.


spar (v)

late 14c., go quickly, rush, dart, spring; c.1400, to strike or thrust, perhaps from Middle French
esparer to kick (Modern French &#233;parer), from Italian sparare to fling, from Latin ex- (see ex-)
+ parare make ready, prepare, hence ward off, parry (see pare). Etymologists consider a connection
with spur unlikely. Used in 17c. in reference to preliminary actions in a cock fight; figurative
sense of to dispute, bandy with words is from 1690s. Extension to humans, in a literal sense, with
meaning to engage in or practice boxing is attested from 1755. Related: Sparred; sparring.
