waif (n.)

late 14c., unclaimed property, flotsam, stray animal, from Anglo-French waif (13c., Old French
guaif) ownerless property, something lost; as an adjective, not claimed, outcast, abandoned,
probably from a Scandinavian source akin to Old Norse veif waving thing, flag, from Proto-Germanic
*waif-, from PIE *weip- to turn, vacillate, tremble ecstatically (see vibrate). Compare Medieval
Latin waivium thing thrown away by a thief in flight. A Scottish/northern English parallel form was
wavenger (late 15c.).    Meaning person (especially a child) without home or friends first attested
1784, from legal phrase waif and stray (1620s), from the adjective in the sense lost, strayed,
homeless. Neglected children being uncommonly thin, the word tended toward this sense. Connotations
of fashionable, small, slender woman began 1991 with application to childishly slim supermodels such
as Kate Moss.


waifish (adj.)

1870, from waif + -ish. Related: Waifishly; waifishness.


waive (v.)

c.1300, deprive of legal protection, from Anglo-French weyver to abandon, waive (Old French guever
to abandon, give back), probably from a Scandinavian source akin to Old Norse veifa to swing about,
from Proto-Germanic *waif- (see waif). In Middle English legal language, used of rights, goods, or
women.    If the defendant be a woman, the proceeding is called a waiver; for as women were not
sworn to the law by taking the oath of allegiance in the leet (as men anciently were when of the age
of twelve years and upwards), they could not properly be outlawed, but were said to be waived, i.e.,
derelicta, left out, or not regarded. [from section subtitled Outlawry in J.J.S. Wharton, Law-
Lexicon, or Dictionary of Jurisprudence, London, 1867]    Related: Waived; waiving.
