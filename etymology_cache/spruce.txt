spruce (n.)

1660s, evergreen tree, fir, from spruse (adj.) made of spruce wood (early 15c.), literally from
Prussia, from Spruce, Sprws (late 14c.), unexplained alterations of Pruce Prussia, from an Old
French form of Prussia.   Spruce seems to have been a generic term for commodities brought to
England by Hanseatic merchants (especially beer, boards and wooden chests, and leather), and the
tree thus was believed to be particular to Prussia, which for a time was figurative in England as a
land of luxuries. Compare spruce (adj.). As a distinct species of fir, from 1731.
