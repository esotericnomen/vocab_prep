sensuous (adj.)

1640s, pertaining to the senses apparently coined by Milton to recover the original meaning of
sensual and avoid the lascivious connotation that the older word had acquired, but by 1870 sensuous,
too, had begun down the same path and come to mean alive to the pleasures of the senses. Rare before
Coleridge popularized it To express in one word all that appertains to the perception, considered as
passive and merely recipient .... (1814). From Latin sensus (see sense (n.)) + -ous. Related:
Sensuously; sensuousness.


delicacy (n.)

late 14c., delightfulness; fastidiousness; quality of being addicted to sensuous pleasure, from
delicate + -cy. Meaning fineness, softness, tender loveliness is from 1580s; that of weakness of
constitution is from 1630s. Meaning fine food, a dainty viand is from early 15c.


aesthetic (n.)

1798, from German &Auml;sthetisch or French esth&eacute;tique, both from Greek aisthetikos
sensitive, perceptive, from aisthanesthai to perceive (by the senses or by the mind), to feel, from
PIE *awis-dh-yo-, from root *au- to perceive (see audience).  Popularized in English by translation
of Immanuel Kant, and used originally in the classically correct sense the science which treats of
the conditions of sensuous perception. Kant had tried to correct the term after Alexander Baumgarten
had taken it in German to mean criticism of taste (1750s), but Baumgarten's sense attained
popularity in English c.1830s (despite scholarly resistance) and removed the word from any
philosophical base. Walter Pater used it (1868) to describe the late 19c. movement that advocated
art for art's sake, which further blurred the sense. As an adjective by 1803. Related:
Aesthetically.
