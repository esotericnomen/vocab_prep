empathy (n.)

1903, from German Einf&uuml;hlung (from ein in + F&uuml;hlung feeling), coined 1858 by German
philosopher Rudolf Lotze (1817-1881) as a translation of Greek empatheia passion, state of emotion,
from en in (see en- (2)) + pathos feeling (see pathos). A term from a theory of art appreciation
that maintains appreciation depends on the viewer's ability to project his personality into the
viewed object.
