skewer (v.)

1701, from the noun. Related: Skewered; skewering.


skewer (n.)

1670s, variant of dialectal skiver (1660s), perhaps from a Scandinavian source such as Old Norse
skifa a cut, slice (of bread, etc.), Swedish skifer a slate, which are related to shiver (n.1) small
piece.


spile (n.)

tap or spout for drawing maple sugar, 1844, from Northern English dialect spile splinter (1510s),
from Middle Dutch or Middle Low German spile splinter, skewer, bar, spindle, German Speiler skewer;
perhaps related to spike (n.1).


kebab (n.)

pieces of meat roasted on a skewer, 1813 (compare shish kebab).


shish kebab (n.)

1914, from Armenian shish kabab, from Turkish siskebap, from sis skewer + kebap roast meat.


souvlaki (n.)

1959, from Modern Greek soublaki, from soubla skewer, in classical Greek awl, akin to Latin subula,
from PIE *syu- (see sew (v)).


dogwood (n.)

shrubs and small trees of the genus Cornus, 1610s, earlier dog-tree (1540s); the first element
sometimes said to have been perhaps dag -- compare dagger, dag (v.) to pierce or stab (1630s,
perhaps 15c.) -- the trees have hard, white wood that was used in making skewers; another name for
it was skewer-wood. But another guess is that the tree was given the name in reference to its fruit,
which was called dogberry from 1550s, and dog had implications of cheap, inferior (i.e. fit for a
dog).
