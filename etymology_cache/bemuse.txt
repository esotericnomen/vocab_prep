bemused (adj.)

1735, past participle adjective from bemuse (v.). Related: Bemusedly.


bemuse (v.)

to make utterly confused, from be- + muse (compare amuse); attested from 1735 but probably older, as
Pope (1705) punned on it as devoted utterly to the Muses.


bemusement (n.)

1881, from bemuse + -ment.


amuse (v.)

late 15c., to divert the attention, beguile, delude, from Middle French amuser divert, cause to
muse, from a at, to (but here probably a causal prefix) + muser ponder, stare fixedly (see muse
(v.)). Sense of divert from serious business, tickle the fancy of is recorded from 1630s, but
through 18c. the primary meaning was deceive, cheat by first occupying the attention. Bemuse retains
more of the original meaning. Related: Amused; amusing.
