cleave (v.2)

to adhere, Middle English cleven, clevien, cliven, from Old English clifian, cleofian, from West
Germanic *klibajan (cognates: Old Saxon klibon, Old High German kliban, Dutch kleven, Old High
German kleben, German kleben to stick, cling, adhere), from PIE *gloi- to stick (see clay). The
confusion was less in Old English when cleave (v.1) was a class 2 strong verb; but it has grown
since cleave (v.1) weakened, which may be why both are largely superseded by stick (v.) and split
(v.).
