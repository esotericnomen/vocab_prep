to adhere, Middle English cleven, clevien, cliven, from Old English clifian, cleofian, from West
Germanic *klibajan (cognates: Old Saxon klibon, Old High German kliban, Dutch kleven, Old High
German kleben, German kleben to stick, cling, adhere), from PIE *gloi- to stick (see <a
href=/index.php?term=clay&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>clay</a>). The confusion was
less in Old English when cleave (v.1) was a class 2 strong verb; but it has grown since cleave (v.1)
weakened, which may be why both are largely superseded by stick (v.) and split (v.).
