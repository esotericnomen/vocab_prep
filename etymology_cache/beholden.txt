hold (v.)

Old English haldan (Anglian), healdan (West Saxon), to contain, grasp; retain; foster, cherish,
class VII strong verb (past tense heold, past participle healden), from Proto-Germanic *haldan
(cognates: Old Saxon haldan, Old Frisian halda, Old Norse halda, Dutch houden, German halten to
hold, Gothic haldan to tend), originally to keep, tend, watch over (as cattle), later to have.

support is from 1935. Phrase hold your horses be patient is from 1844. To have and to hold have been
