obstreperous (adj.)

c.1600, from Latin obstreperus clamorous, from obstrepere drown with noise, make a noise against,
oppose noisily, from ob against (see ob-) + strepere make a noise, from PIE *strep-, said to be
imitative (compare Latin stertare to snore, Old Norse &#254;rapt chattering, Old English
&#254;r&#230;ft quarrel). Related: Obstreperously; obstreperousness.


stroppy (adj.)

rebellious, by 1943, British nautical slang, perhaps a slang mangling of obstreperous. Sea Passages:
A Naval Anthology and Introduction to the Study of English [1943, Geoffrey Callender] quotes from a
letter:    Why Nobby should reckon that his raggie should blow the gaff, when there are crushers
everywhere, leaves me guessing; but there it is. In the last dog he rounded on me and called me a
white rat. I got stroppy and told him he was shooting a line: but all he said was, 'Oh! choke your
luff! I'm looking for another oppo you snivelling sand-catcher.' So that looks like paying off.
to which Callender adds, There is nothing in this letter which an active service rating could fail
to understand.
