c.1300, characterized by intellectual depth, from Old French profund (12c., Modern French profond),
from Latin profundus deep, bottomless, vast, also obscure; profound; immoderate, from pro- forth
(see <a href=/index.php?term=pro-&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>pro-</a>) + fundus
bottom (see <a href=/index.php?term=fund&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>fund</a> (n.)).
The literal and figurative senses both were in Latin, but English, having already deep, employed
this word primarily in its figurative sense. Related: Profoundly.
