profound (adj.)

c.1300, characterized by intellectual depth, from Old French profund (12c., Modern French profond),
from Latin profundus deep, bottomless, vast, also obscure; profound; immoderate, from pro- forth
(see pro-) + fundus bottom (see fund (n.)). The literal and figurative senses both were in Latin,
but English, having already deep, employed this word primarily in its figurative sense. Related:
Profoundly.
