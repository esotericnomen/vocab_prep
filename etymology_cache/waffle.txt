waffle (n.)

kind of batter-cake, baked crisp in irons and served hot, 1744, from Dutch wafel waffle, from Middle
Dutch or Middle Low German wafel, from Proto-Germanic *wabila- web, honeycomb (cognates: Old High
German waba honeycomb, German Wabe), related to Old High German weban, Old English wefan to weave
(see weave (v.)). Sense of honeycomb is preserved in some combinations referring to a weave of
cloth. Waffle iron is from 1794.


waffle (v.)

1690s, to yelp, bark, frequentative of provincial waff to yelp, to bark like a puppy (1610);
possibly of imitative origin. Figurative sense of talk foolishly (c.1700) led to that of vacillate,
equivocate (1803), originally a Scottish and northern English usage. Late 17c. Scottish also had
waff act of waving, variant of waft, which might have influenced the sense. Related: Waffled;
waffler; waffling.


wafer (n.)

late 14c., thin cake of paste, generally disk-shaped, from Anglo-French wafre, Old North French
waufre honeycomb, wafer (Old French gaufre wafer, waffle), probably from Frankish *wafel or another
Germanic source (compare Flemish wafer, altered from Middle Dutch wafel honeycomb; see waffle (n.)).
Eucharistic bread first so called 1550s.


gopher (n.)

1812, American English, perhaps an Englishing of Louisiana French gaufre honeycomb, waffle, said to
have been used by French settlers in reference to small mammals on analogy of the structure of their
burrows, from Old French gaufre, of Frankish origin. The rodent was the nickname of people from
Arkansas (1845) and later Minnesota (1872). The gopherwood tree of the Bible (used by Noah to make
the ark, Gen. vi:14) is unrelated; it is from Hebrew gofer, perhaps meaning the cypress.
