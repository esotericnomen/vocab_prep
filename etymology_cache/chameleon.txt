chameleon (n.)

mid-14c., camelion, from Old French cam&eacute;l&eacute;on, from Latin chamaeleon, from Greek
khamaileon the chameleon, from khamai on the ground (also dwarf), akin to chthon earth (see
chthonic) + leon lion (see lion). Perhaps the large head-crest on some species was thought to
resemble a lion's mane. The classical -h- was restored in English early 18c. Figurative sense of
variable person is 1580s. It formerly was supposed to live on air (as in Hamlet III.ii.98).
