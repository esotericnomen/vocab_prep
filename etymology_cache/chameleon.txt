mid-14c., camelion, from Old French cam&eacute;l&eacute;on, from Latin chamaeleon, from Greek
khamaileon the chameleon, from khamai on the ground (also dwarf), akin to chthon earth (see <a
href=/index.php?term=chthonic&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>chthonic</a>) + leon lion
(see <a href=/index.php?term=lion&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>lion</a>). Perhaps the
large head-crest on some species was thought to resemble a lion's mane. The classical -h- was
restored in English early 18c. Figurative sense of variable person is 1580s. It formerly was
supposed to live on air (as in Hamlet III.ii.98).
