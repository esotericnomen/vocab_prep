[The Dispenser's Formulary: Or, Soda Water Guide, New York, 1915]   <hr />   Few soda water
dispensers know what is meant by a Float Ice Cream Soda. This is not strange since the term is a
coined one. By a float ice cream soda is meant a soda with the ice cream floating on top, thus
making a most inviting appearance and impressing the customer that you are liberal with your ice
cream, when you are not really giving any more than the fellow that mixes his ice cream out of
sight. [The Spatula, Boston, July, 1908]


sorbet (n.)

1580s, cooling drink of fruit juice and water, from French sorbet (16c.), probably from Italian
sorbetto, from Turkish serbet (see sherbet). Perhaps influenced in form by Italian sorbire to sip.
Meaning semi-liquid water ice as a dessert first recorded 1864.


syrup (n.)

late 14c., thick, sweet liquid, from Old French sirop sugared drink (13c.), and perhaps from Italian
siroppo, both from Arabic sharab beverage, wine, literally something drunk, from verb shariba he
drank (compare sherbet). Spanish jarabe, jarope, Old Proven&ccedil;al eissarop are from Arabic;
Italian sciroppo is via Medieval Latin sirupus. In English, formerly also sirup, sirop.
