cinder (n.)

Old English sinder dross of iron, slag, from Proto-Germanic *sendra- slag (cognates: Old Saxon
sinder slag, dross, Old Norse sindr, Middle Low German and Middle Dutch sinder, Dutch sintel, Old
High German sintar, German Sinter), from PIE root *sendhro- coagulating fluid (cognates: Old Church
Slavonic sedra cinder).    Initial s- changed to c- under influence of unrelated French cendre
ashes, from Latin cinerem (nominative cinis) ashes, from or related to Greek konis dust (see
incinerate). The French word also apparently shifted the sense of the English one to small piece of
burnt coal (16c.). Volcanic cinder cone is recorded from 1849.
