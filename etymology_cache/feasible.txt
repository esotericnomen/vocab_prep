capable of being done, accomplished or carried out, mid-15c., from Anglo-French faisible, from Old
French faisable possible, easy, convenient, from fais-, stem of faire do, make, from Latin facere
do, perform (see <a href=/index.php?term=factitious&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>factitious</a>). Fowler recommends this word only for those who feel that the
use of an ordinary word for an ordinary notion does not do justice to their vocabulary or
sufficiently exhibit their cultivation.
