feasible (adj.)

capable of being done, accomplished or carried out, mid-15c., from Anglo-French faisible, from Old
French faisable possible, easy, convenient, from fais-, stem of faire do, make, from Latin facere
do, perform (see factitious). Fowler recommends this word only for those who feel that the use of an
ordinary word for an ordinary notion does not do justice to their vocabulary or sufficiently exhibit
their cultivation.
