rickety (adj.)

liable to fall down, 1680s, from rickets (with + -y (2)), via notion of weak, unhealthy. Literal
sense is from c.1720 but never common in English. Of material things, from 1799.


rattletrap

1766, originally a noun, knick-knacks, trifles, odds and ends, from rattle (adj.) + trap, perhaps in
the sense in traps (n.2). Hence, a shabby, rattling object, especially a rickety coach or other
vehicle (1822). The adjectival sense of rickety is recorded from 1834.


shack (n.)

1878, American English and Canadian English, of unknown origin, perhaps from Mexican Spanish jacal,
from Nahuatl (Aztecan) xacalli wooden hut. Or perhaps a back-formation from dialectal English
shackly shaky, rickety (1843), a derivative of shack, a dialectal variant of shake (v.). Another
theory derives shack from ramshackle.    Slang meaning house attested by 1910. In early radio
enthusiast slang, it was the word for a room or office set aside for wireless use, 1919, perhaps
from earlier U.S. Navy use (1917). As a verb, 1891 in the U.S. West in reference to men who hole up
for the winter; from 1927 as to put up for the night; phrase shack up cohabit first recorded 1935
(in Zora Neale Hurston).
