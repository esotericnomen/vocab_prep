libretto (n.)

(plural libretti), 1742, from Italian libretto, diminutive of libro book, from Latin liber (genitive
libri), see library. Related: Librettist.


book (n.)

Old English boc book, writing, written document, traditionally from Proto-Germanic *bokiz beech
(cognates: German Buch book Buche beech; see beech), the notion being of beechwood tablets on which
runes were inscribed, but it may be from the tree itself (people still carve initials in them). The
Old English word originally meant any written document. Latin and Sanskrit also have words for
writing that are based on tree names (birch and ash, respectively). Meaning libretto of an opera is
from 1768. A betting book is from 1856.
