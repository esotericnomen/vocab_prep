sardonic (adj.)

apparently but not really proceeding from gaiety, 1630s, from French sardonique (16c.), from Latin
sardonius (but as if from Latin *sardonicus) in Sardonius risus, loan-translation of Greek sardonios
(gelos) of bitter or scornful (laughter), altered from Homeric sardanios (of uncertain origin) by
influence of Sardonios Sardinian, because the Greeks believed that eating a certain plant they
called sardonion (literally plant from Sardinia, see Sardinia) caused facial convulsions resembling
those of sardonic laughter, usually followed by death. For nuances of usage, see humor. Earlier in
same sense sardonian (1580s), from Latin sardonius. Related: Sardonically.
