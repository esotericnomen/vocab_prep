apparently but not really proceeding from gaiety, 1630s, from French sardonique (16c.), from Latin
sardonius (but as if from Latin *sardonicus) in Sardonius risus, loan-translation of Greek sardonios
(gelos) of bitter or scornful (laughter), altered from Homeric sardanios (of uncertain origin) by
influence of Sardonios Sardinian, because the Greeks believed that eating a certain plant they
called sardonion (literally plant from Sardinia, see <a
href=/index.php?term=Sardinia&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>Sardinia</a>) caused
facial convulsions resembling those of sardonic laughter, usually followed by death. For nuances of
usage, see <a href=/index.php?term=humor&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>humor</a>.
Earlier in same sense sardonian (1580s), from Latin sardonius. Related: Sardonically.
