irrelevant (adj.)

1680s, from assimilated form of in- (1) not, opposite of + relevant. Related: Irrelevantly.


irrelevance (n.)

1735, from irrelevant + -ance. Earlier in the same sense was irrelevancy (1590s).


linguistic (adj.)

1856, from French linguistique (1833); see linguist + -ic. The use of linguistic to mean of or
pertaining to language or languages is hardly justifiable etymologically, according to OED, but has
arisen because lingual suggests irrelevant associations. Related: linguistically.


bunk (n.2)

nonsense, 1900, short for bunkum, phonetic spelling of Buncombe, a county in North Carolina. The
usual story (by 1841) of its origin is this: At the close of the protracted Missouri statehood
debates, supposedly on Feb. 25, 1820, N.C. Representative Felix Walker (1753-1828) began what
promised to be a long, dull, irrelevant speech, and he resisted calls to cut it short by saying he
was bound to say something that could appear in the newspapers in the home district and prove he was
on the job. I shall not be speaking to the House, he confessed, but to Buncombe. Bunkum has been
American English slang for nonsense since 1841 (from 1838 as generic for a U.S. Representative's
home district).    MR. WALKER, of North Carolina, rose then to address the Committee on the question
[of Missouri statehood]; but the question was called for so clamorously and so perseveringly that
Mr. W. could proceed no farther than to move that the committee rise. [Annals of Congress, House of
Representatives, 16th Congress, 1st Session, p. 1539]
