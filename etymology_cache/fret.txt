fret (n.)

ornamental interlaced pattern, late 14c., from Old French frete interlaced work, trellis work,
probably from Frankish *fetur or another Germanic source (cognates: Old English fetor, Old High
German feggara fetter) perhaps from notion of decorative anklet, or of materials bound together. The
other noun, ridge on the fingerboard of a guitar, is c.1500 of unknown origin but possibly another
sense of Old French frete.


fret (v.)

be peevish or worried, early 12c., from Old English fretan eat, devour (in Old English used of
monsters and Vikings; in Middle English used of animals' eating), from Proto-Germanic compound *fra-

fraitan). Transitive sense of eat away is from late 12c. Figurative sense of irritate, worry, eat
one's heart out is c.1200. Modern German still distinguishes essen for humans and fressen for
animals. Related: Fretted; fretting. As a noun, from early 15c.
