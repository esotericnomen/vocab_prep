barracks (n.)

plural, and usual, form of barrack (q.v.).


barrack (n.)

1680s, temporary hut for soldiers during a siege, from French barraque, from Spanish barraca (mid-
13c. in Medieval Latin) soldier's tent, literally cabin, hut, perhaps from barro clay, mud, which is
probably of Celt-Iberian origin. Meaning permanent building for housing troops (usually in plural)
is attested from 1690s.


rookie (n.)

raw recruit, 1892 in that spelling, popularized by Kipling's Barrack-Room Ballads, of uncertain
origin, perhaps from recruit, influenced by rook (n.1) in its secondary sense, suggesting easy to
cheat. Barr&#232;re [A Dictionary of Slang, Jargon &amp; Cant, 1890] has Rookey (army), a recruit;
from the black coat some of them wear, so perhaps directly from rook (n.1). Came into general use in
American English during the Spanish-American War.    The rapid growth of a word from a single seed
transplanted in a congenial soil is one of the curiosities of literature. Take a single instance. A
few weeks ago there was not one American soldier in a thousand who knew there was such a word as
rookey. To-day there are few soldiers and ex-soldiers who have not substituted it for raw recruit.
