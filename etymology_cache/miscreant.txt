miscreant (adj.)

c.1300, non-Christian, pagan, infidel; early 15c., heretical, unbelieving, from Old French mescreant
disbelieving (Modern French m&#233;cr&#233;ant), from mes- wrongly (see mis- (2)) + creant, present
participle of creire believe, from Latin credere (see credo). Meaning villainous is from 1590s.


mis- (2)

in mischief, miscreant, etc., represents Old French mes- bad, badly, wrong, wrongly, from Vulgar
Latin minus-, from Latin minus less (see minus), which was not used as a prefix. Perhaps influenced
in Old French by *miss-, the Frankish equivalent of mis- (1).
