madding (adj.)

present participle adjective from obsolete verb mad to make insane; to become insane (see madden);
now principally in the phrase far from the madding crowd, title of a novel by Hardy (1874), who
lifted it from a line of Gray's Elegy (1749), which seems to echo a line from Drummond of
Hawthornden from 1614 (Farre from the madding Worldling's hoarse discords).


elegiac (adj.)

1580s, from Middle French &eacute;l&eacute;giaque, from Latin elegiacus, from Greek elegeiakos, from
eleigeia (see elegy). Related: Elegiacally.


elegize (v.)

wade (v.)

Old English wadan to go forward, proceed, move, stride, advance (the modern sense perhaps
represented in oferwaden wade across), from Proto-Germanic *wadan (cognates: Old Norse va&eth;a,
Danish vade, Old Frisian wada, Dutch waden, Old High German watan, German waten to wade), from PIE
root *wadh- (2) to go, found only in Germanic and Latin (cognates: Latin vadere to go, vadum shoal,
ford, vadare to wade). Italian guado, French gu&eacute; ford are Germanic loan-words.
Specifically walk into or through water (or any substance which impedes the free motion of limbs)
c.1200. Originally a strong verb (past tense wod, past participle wad); weak since 16c. Figurative
sense of to go into (action, battle, etc.) is recorded from late 14c. Related: Waded; wading.
Forbade to wade through slaughter to a throne,  And shut the gates of mercy on mankind,    [Gray,
Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard]
