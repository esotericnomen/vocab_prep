mid-14c., morally weak, from Old French fraile weak, frail, sickly, infirm (Modern French
fr&ecirc;le), from Latin fragilis easily broken (see <a
href=/index.php?term=fragility&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>fragility</a>). Sense of
liable to break is first recorded in English late 14c. The U.S. slang noun meaning a woman is
attested from 1908.
