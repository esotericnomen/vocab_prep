expatriate (v.)

1768, from French expatrier banish (14c.), from ex- out of (see ex-) + patrie native land, from
Latin patria one's native country, from pater (genitive patris) father (see father (n.); also
compare patriot). Related: Expatriated; expatriating. The noun is from 1818, one who has been

Jamesian (adj.)

of or in the mode of James, 1875 in reference to William James (1842-1910) U.S. philosopher and
exponent of pragmatism; 1905 in reference to his brother Henry James (1843-1916), U.S. expatriate
novelist.


terrorist (n.)

in the modern sense, 1944, especially in reference to Jewish tactics against the British in
Palestine -- earlier it was used of extremist revolutionaries in Russia who attempted to demoralize
the government by terror (1866); and Jacobins during the French Revolution (1795) -- from French
terroriste; see terror + -ist (also see terrorism).    The term now usually refers to a member of a
clandestine or expatriate organization aiming to coerce an established government by acts of
violence against it or its subjects. [OED]    The tendency of one party's terrorist to be another's
guerilla or freedom fighter was noted in reference to the British action in Cyprus (1956) and the
war in Rhodesia (1973). The word terrorist has been applied, at least retroactively, to the Maquis
resistance in occupied France in World War II (as in in the Spectator, Oct. 20, 1979).
