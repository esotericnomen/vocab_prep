bereavement (n.)

1731, from bereave + -ment.


Niobe

in Greek mythology, a queen of Thebes, daughter of Tantalus, changed to a stone while weeping for
her children (slain, after she boasted of them overmuch, by Artemis and Apollo); hence the name is
used figuratively for bereavement and woe. The name is said to mean literally snowy; snowy-bright.
