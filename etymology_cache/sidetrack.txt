sidetrack (n.)

also side-track, railway siding, 1835, from side (adj.) + track (n.). The verb meaning to move (a
train car) onto a sidetrack is from 1874; figurative sense of to divert from the main purpose is
attested from 1881. Related: Sidetracked.


zenith (n.)

point of the heavens directly overhead at any place, late 14c., from Old French cenith (Modern
French z&eacute;nith), from Medieval Latin cenit, senit, bungled scribal transliterations of Arabic
samt road, path, abbreviation of samt ar-ras, literally the way over the head. Letter -m- misread as
-ni-.    The Medieval Latin word could as well be influenced by the rough agreement of the Arabic
term with classical Latin semita sidetrack, side path (notion of thing going off to the side), from
se- apart + *mi-ta-, suffixed zero-grade form of PIE root *mei- (1) to change (see mutable).
Figurative sense of highest point or state is from c.1600.
