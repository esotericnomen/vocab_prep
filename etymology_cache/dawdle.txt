doodle (v.)

scrawl aimlessly, 1935, from dialectal doodle, dudle fritter away time, trifle, or associated with

home for people who make foolish designs on paper when they're thinking. It's called doodling.
Almost everybody's a doodler. Did you ever see a scratch pad in a telephone booth? People draw the
most idiotic pictures when they're thinking. Dr. Von Holler, here, could probably think up a long
name for it, because he doodles all the time. [Mr. Deeds Goes to Town, screenplay by Robert Riskin,

Kelland]    Related: Doodled; Doodling.    Doodle Sack. A bagpipe. Dutch. -- Also the private parts
