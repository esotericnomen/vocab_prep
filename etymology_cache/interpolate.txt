1610s, to alter or enlarge (a writing) by inserting new material, from Latin interpolatus, past
participle of interpolare alter, freshen up, polish; of writing, falsify, from inter- up (see <a
href=/index.php?term=inter-&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>inter-</a>) + polare,
related to polire to smoothe, polish. Sense evolved in Latin from refurbish, to alter appearance of,
to falsify (especially by adding new material). Middle English had interpolen (early 15c.) in a
similar sense. Related: Interpolated; interpolating.
