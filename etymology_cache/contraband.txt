contraband (n.)

1520s, smuggling; 1590s, smuggled goods; from Middle French contrebande a smuggling, from older
Italian contrabando (modern contrabbando) unlawful dealing, from Latin contra against (see contra) +
Medieval Latin bannum, from Frankish *ban a command or some other Germanic source (see ban (v.)).


smuggler (n.)

1660s, from Low German smuggeln or Dutch smokkelen to transport (goods) illegally, apparently a
frequentative formation of a word meaning to sneak (from Proto-Germanic *smuganan; cognates: Dutch
smuigen to eat secretly; Swedish smyg a lurking-hole, Danish smughandel contraband trade, Norwegian
smjuga, Old English smeogan to creep), perhaps literally to slip (contraband through), from Proto-
Germanic *(s)muk- (see smock).


ban (v.)

Old English bannan to summon, command, proclaim, from Proto-Germanic *bannan proclaim, command,
forbid (cognates: Old High German bannan to command or forbid under threat of punishment, German
bannen banish, expel, curse), originally to speak publicly, from PIE root *bha- (2) to speak
(cognates: Old Irish bann law, Armenian ban word; see fame (n.)).     Main modern sense of to
prohibit (late 14c.) is from Old Norse cognate banna to curse, prohibit, and probably in part from
Old French ban, which meant outlawry, banishment, among other things (see banal) and was a borrowing
from Germanic. The sense evolution in Germanic was from speak to proclaim a threat to (in Norse,
German, etc.) curse.    The Germanic root, borrowed in Latin and French, has been productive:
banish, bandit, contraband, etc. Related: Banned; banning. Banned in Boston dates from 1920s, in
allusion to the excessive zeal and power of that city's Watch and Ward Society.
