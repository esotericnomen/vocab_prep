winsome (adj.)

Old English wynsum agreeable, pleasant, from wynn pleasure, delight, from Proto-Germanic *wunjo-
(cognates: Old Saxon wunnia, Old High German wunja, German Wonne joy, delight; see win (v.)) + -sum
(see -some (1)). Apparently surviving only in northern English dialect for 400 years until revived
18c. by Hamilton, Burns, and other Scottish poets. Similar formation in Old Saxon wunsam, Old High
German wunnisam. Related: Winsomely; winsomeness.


pin-up (adj.)

1670s, from pin (v.) + up (adv.). From 1940, in reference to pictures of winsome young ladies in
daring undress (Life, May 6, 1940) such as soldiers pinned up on their dugout walls, etc. The thing
itself is older than the name. The noun in this sense is recorded from 1943.
