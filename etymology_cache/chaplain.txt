hurricane (n.)

1550s, a partially deformed adoptation from Spanish huracan (Gonzalo Fernandez de Oviedo y
Vald&eacute;s, Historia General y Natural de las Indias, 1547-9), furacan (in the works of Pedro
M&aacute;rtir De Anghiera, chaplain to the court of King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella and historian
of Spanish explorations), from an Arawakan (W. Indies) word. In Portuguese, it became
furac&atilde;o. For confusion of initial -f- and -h- in Spanish, see hacienda. The word is first in
English in Richard Eden's Decades of the New World:  These tempestes of the ayer (which the Grecians
caule Tiphones ...) they caule furacanes.    OED records 39 different spellings, mostly from the
late 16c., including forcane, herrycano, harrycain, hurlecane. Modern form became frequent from
1650, established after 1688. Shakespeare uses hurricano (King Lear, Troilus and Cressida), but in
reference to waterspouts.
