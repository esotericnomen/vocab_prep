late 14c., from Latin astrologia astronomy, the science of the heavenly bodies, from Greek
astrologia telling of the stars, from astron star (see <a
href=/index.php?term=astro-&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>astro-</a>) + -logia
treating of (see <a href=/index.php?term=-logy&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>-logy</a>).  <br /><br />  Originally identical with <a
href=/index.php?term=astronomy&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>astronomy</a>, it had
also a special sense of practical astronomy, astronomy applied to prediction of events. This was
divided into natural astrology the calculation and foretelling of natural phenomenon (tides,
eclipses, etc.), and judicial astrology the art of judging occult influences of stars on human
affairs (also known as astromancy, 1650s). Differentiation between astrology and astronomy began
late 1400s and by 17c. this word was limited to reading influences of the stars and their effects on
human destiny.
