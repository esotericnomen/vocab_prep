1620s, anslaight, somehow from or on analogy of Dutch aanslag attack, from Middle Dutch aenslach,
from aen on (see <a href=/index.php?term=on&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>on</a>) +
slach blow, related to slaen slay. Spelling influenced by obsolete (since c.1400) English slaught
(n.) slaughter, from Old English sleaht (see <a
href=/index.php?term=slaughter&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>slaughter</a> (n.)). No
record of its use in 18c.; apparently revived by Scott.
