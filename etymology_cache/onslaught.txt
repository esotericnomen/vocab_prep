onslaught (n.)

1620s, anslaight, somehow from or on analogy of Dutch aanslag attack, from Middle Dutch aenslach,
from aen on (see on) + slach blow, related to slaen slay. Spelling influenced by obsolete (since
c.1400) English slaught (n.) slaughter, from Old English sleaht (see slaughter (n.)). No record of
its use in 18c.; apparently revived by Scott.
