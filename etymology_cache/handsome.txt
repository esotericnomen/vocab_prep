(in handsome reward, etc.) first recorded 1680s.  <blockquote>  [Americans] use the word handsome
much more extensively than we do: saying that Webster made a handsome speech in the Senate: that a
lady talks handsomely, (eloquently:) that a book sells handsomely. A gentleman asked me on the
Catskill Mountain, whether I thought the sun handsomer there than at New York. [Harriet Martineau,
Society in America, 1837]  </blockquote>  Related: Handsomeness.
