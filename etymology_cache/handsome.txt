handsome (adj.)

c.1400, handsom easy to handle, ready at hand, from hand (n.) + -some (1). Sense extended to fair
size, considerable (1570s), then having fine form, good-looking (1580s). Meaning generous (in
handsome reward, etc.) first recorded 1680s.  <blockquote>  [Americans] use the word handsome much
more extensively than we do: saying that Webster made a handsome speech in the Senate: that a lady
talks handsomely, (eloquently:) that a book sells handsomely. A gentleman asked me on the Catskill
Mountain, whether I thought the sun handsomer there than at New York. [Harriet Martineau, Society in
America, 1837]  </blockquote>  Related: Handsomeness.
