French Madelaine), woman's name, originally surname of Mary the repentant sinner forgiven by Jesus

from Aramaic Maghdela, place on the Sea of Galilee, literally tower. The vernacular form of the

mat (adj.)

1640s, lusterless, dull (of a color or surface), from French mat dull, dead surface, from Old French
mat beaten down, withered, afflicted, dejected; dull, which is perhaps from Latin mattus maudlin
with drink, from madere to be wet or sodden, be drunk, from PIE root *mad- to be wet, drip (see mast
(n.2)). Or the French word might represent a transferred use from chess of mater to checkmate,
defeat, from Arabic (see mate (v.2)).
