lead (n.1)

heavy metal, Old English lead, from West Germanic *loudhom (cognates: Old Frisian lad, Middle Dutch
loot, Dutch lood lead, German Lot weight, plummet). The name and the skill in using the metal seem
to have been borrowed from the Celts (compare Old Irish luaide), probably from PIE root *plou(d)- to
flow.    Figurative of heaviness since at least early 14c. Black lead was an old name for graphite,
hence lead pencil (1680s) and the colloquial figurative phrase to have lead in one's pencil be
possessed of (especially male sexual) vigor, attested by 1902. Lead balloon a failure, American
English slang, attested by 1957 (as a type of something heavy that can be kept up only with effort,
from 1904). Lead-footed slow is from 1896; opposite sense of fast emerged 1940s in trucker's jargon,
from notion of a foot heavy on the gas pedal.
