hydrophobia (n.)

late 14c., idroforbia, a symptom of rabies in man (sometimes used for the disease itself), from Late
Latin hydrophobia (Celsius, 50 C.E.), from Greek hydrophobos dreading water, from hydr-, stem of
hydros water (see water (n.1)) + phobos dread, fear (see phobia). So called because human sufferers
show aversion to water and have difficulty swallowing it. In Old English as w&aelig;terfyrhtness.


hydrophobic (adj.)

1807, from hydrophobia + -ic.


rabies (n.)

1590s, from Latin rabies madness, rage, fury, related to rabere be mad, rave (see rage (v.)). Sense
of extremely fatal infectious disease causing madness in dogs was a secondary meaning in Latin.
Known hydrophobia in humans.


rage (n.)

c.1300, madness, insanity; fit of frenzy; anger, wrath; fierceness in battle; violence of storm,
fire, etc., from Old French rage, raige spirit, passion, rage, fury, madness (11c.), from Medieval
Latin rabia, from Latin rabies madness, rage, fury, related to rabere be mad, rave (compare rabies,
which originally had this sense), from PIE *rebh- violent, impetuous (cognates: Old English rabbian
to rage). Similarly, Welsh (cynddaredd) and Breton (kounnar) words for rage, fury originally meant
hydrophobia and are compounds based on the word for dog (Welsh ci, plural cwn; Breton ki). In
15c.-16c. it also could mean rabies. The rage fashion, vogue dates from 1785.
