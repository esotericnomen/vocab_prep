late 14c., idroforbia, a symptom of rabies in man (sometimes used for the disease itself), from Late
Latin hydrophobia (Celsius, 50 C.E.), from Greek hydrophobos dreading water, from hydr-, stem of
hydros water (see <a href=/index.php?term=water&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>water</a> (n.1)) + phobos dread, fear (see <a
href=/index.php?term=phobia&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>phobia</a>). So called
because human sufferers show aversion to water and have difficulty swallowing it. In Old English as
w&aelig;terfyrhtness.
