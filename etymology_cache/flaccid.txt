flaccid (adj.)

1610s, from French flaccide or directly from Latin flaccidus flabby, from flaccus flabby, flap-
eared, of uncertain origin (OED suggests it's imitative). Related: Flaccidly; flaccidity.


limp (adj.)

1706, flaccid, drooping, of obscure origin, perhaps related to limp (v.).


lush (adj.)

mid-15c., lax, flaccid, soft, tender, from Old French lasche soft, succulent, from laschier loosen,
from Late Latin laxicare become shaky, related to Latin laxare loosen, from laxus loose (see lax).
Sense of luxuriant in growth is first attested c.1600, in Shakespeare. Applied to colors since 1744.
Related: Lushly; lushness.


limber (adj.)

pliant, flexible, 1560s, of uncertain origin, possibly from limb (n.1) on notion of supple boughs of
a tree [Barnhart], or from limp flaccid [Skeat], or somehow from Middle English lymer shaft of a
cart (see limber (n.)), but the late appearance of the -b- in that word argues against it. Related:
Limberness. Dryden used limber-ham (see ham (n.1) in the joint sense) as a name for a character
perswaded by what is last said to him, and changing next word.


lank (adj.)

Old English hlanc loose and empty, slender, flaccid, from Proto-Germanic *khlankaz, perhaps from a
root meaning flexible (cognates: German lenken to bend, turn aside, Old Norse hlykkr bend, noose,
loop), from PIE root *kleng- to bend, turn (see link (n.)). Some examples may be long adj. with
unvoicing of g [Middle English Dictionary]
