decrepitude (n.)

c.1600, from French d&eacute;cr&eacute;pitude (14c.), from Latin decrepitus (see decrepit).


decrepit (adj.)

mid-15c., from Middle French d&eacute;cr&eacute;pit (15c.), from Latin decrepitus very old, infirm,
from de- down (see de-) + *crepitus, past participle of crepare to crack, break (see raven).


Tin Pan Alley (n.)

hit song writing business, 1907, from tin pan, slang for a decrepit piano (1882). The original one
was that little section of Twenty-eighth Street, Manhattan, that lies between Broadway and Sixth
Avenue, home to many music publishing houses.


lazy (adj.)

1540s, laysy, of unknown origin. Replaced native slack, slothful, and idle as the main word
expressing the notion of averse to work. In 19c. thought to be from lay (v.) as tipsy from tip.
Skeat is responsible for the prevailing modern view that it probably comes from Low German, from a
source such as Middle Low German laisch weak, feeble, tired, modern Low German l&auml;&ouml;sig,
early modern Dutch leuzig, all of which may go back to the PIE root *(s)leg- slack. According to
Weekley, the -z- sound disqualifies a connection with French lass&eacute; tired or German lassig
lazy, weary, tired. A supposed dialectal meaning naught, bad, if it is the original sense, may tie
the word to Old Norse lasenn dilapidated, lasm&oslash;yrr decrepit, fragile, root of Icelandic las-
fur&eth;a ailing, las-leiki ailment. Lazy Susan is from 1917. Grose (Dictionary of the Vulgar
Tongue, 1788) has Lazy Man's Load: Lazy people frequently take up more than they can safely carry,
to save the trouble of coming a second time.
