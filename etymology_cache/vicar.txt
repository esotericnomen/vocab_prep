vicarage (n.)

early 15c., benefice of a vicar, from vicar + -age. Meaning house or residence of a vicar is from
1520s.


vicar (n.)

early 14c., from Anglo-French vicare, Old French vicaire deputy, second in command, also in the
ecclesiastical sense (12c.), from Latin vicarius a substitute, deputy, proxy, noun use of adjective
vicarius substituted, delegated, from vicis change, interchange, succession; a place, position (see
vicarious). The original notion is of earthly representative of God or Christ; but also used in
sense of person acting as parish priest in place of a real parson (early 14c.).    The original
Vicar of Bray (in figurative use from 1660s) seems to have been Simon Allen, who held the benefice
from c.1540 to 1588, thus serving from the time of Henry VIII to Elizabeth I, being twice a Catholic
and twice a Protestant but always vicar of Bray. The village is near Maidenhead in Berkshire.


blarney (n.)

1796, from Blarney Stone (which is said to make a persuasive flatterer of any who kiss it), in a
castle near Cork, Ireland. As Bartlett explains it, the reason is the difficulty of the feat of
kissing the stone where it sits high up in the battlement: to have ascended it, was proof of
perseverence, courage, and agility, whereof many are supposed to claim the honor who never achieved
the adventure. So to have kissed the Blarney Stone came to mean to tell wonderful tales [Dictionary
of Americanisms, 1848]. The word reached wide currency through Lady Blarney, the smooth-talking
flatterer in Goldsmith's Vicar of Wakefield (1766). As a verb from 1803.
