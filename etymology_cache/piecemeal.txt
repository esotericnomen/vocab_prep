meal (n.1)

food; time for eating, c.1200 (perhaps late Old English), mel appointed time for eating, also a
meal, feast, from Old English m&aelig;l fixed time, occasion, a meal, from Proto-Germanic
*m&aelig;la- (cognates: Old Frisian mel time; Middle Dutch mael, Dutch maal time, meal; Old Norse
mal measure, time, meal; German Mal time, Mahl meal; Gothic mel time, hour), from PIE *me-lo-, from
root *me- to measure (see meter (n.2)). Original sense of time is preserved in piecemeal. Meals-on-
wheels attested from 1961. Meal ticket first attested 1870 in literal sense of ticket of admission
to a dining hall; figurative sense of source of income or livelihood is from 1899.
