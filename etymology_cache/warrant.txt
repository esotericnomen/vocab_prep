c.1200, protector, defender, from Old North French warant defender; surety, pledge; justifying
evidence (Old French garant), from Frankish *warand, from Proto-Germanic *war- to warn, guard,
protect (cognates: Old High German werento guarantor, noun use of present participle of weren to
authorize, warrant; German gew&auml;hren to grant), from PIE root *wer- (5) to cover (see <a
href=/index.php?term=weir&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>weir</a>).  <br /><br />
Sense evolved via notion of permission from a superior which protects one from blame or
responsibility (early 14c.) to document conveying authority (1510s). A warrant officer in the
military is one who holds office by warrant (as from a government department), rather than by
commission (from a head of state).
