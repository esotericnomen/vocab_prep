canard (n.)

before 1850, from French canard a hoax, literally a duck (from Old French quanart, probably echoic
of a duck's quack); said by Littr&eacute; to be from the phrase vendre un canard &agrave;
moiti&eacute; to half-sell a duck, thus, from some long-forgotten joke, to cheat.


cancan (n.)

also can-can, 1848, from French, possibly from can, a French children's word for duck (see canard),
via some notion of waddling too obscure or obscene to attempt to disentangle here. Or perhaps from
French cancan (16c.) noise, disturbance, echoic of quacking.
