posthumous (adj.)

mid-15c., born after the death of the originator (author or father), from Late Latin posthumus, from
Latin postumus last, last-born, superlative of posterus coming after, subsequent (see posterior).
Altered in Late Latin by association with Latin humare to bury, suggesting death; the one born after
the father's death obviously being the last. An Old English word for this was &aelig;fterboren,
literally after-born. Related: Posthumously.
