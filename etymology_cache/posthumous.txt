mid-15c., born after the death of the originator (author or father), from Late Latin posthumus, from
Latin postumus last, last-born, superlative of posterus coming after, subsequent (see <a
href=/index.php?term=posterior&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>posterior</a>). Altered
in Late Latin by association with Latin humare to bury, suggesting death; the one born after the
father's death obviously being the last. An Old English word for this was &aelig;fterboren,
literally after-born. Related: Posthumously.
