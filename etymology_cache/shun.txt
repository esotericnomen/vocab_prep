shun (v.)

Old English scunian to shun, avoid; abhor; desist, abstain; to hide, seek safety by concealment, of
uncertain origin; not found in any other language. Perhaps ultimately from PIE root *skeu- to cover,
to hide. Related: Shunned; shunning. A shun-pike (American English, 1911) was a road constructed to
avoid tolls.
