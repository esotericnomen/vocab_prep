cower (v.)

c.1300, probably from Middle Low German *kuren lie in wait (Modern German kauern), or similar
Scandinavian words meaning to squat and to doze (such as Old Norse kura, Danish, Norwegian kure,
Swedish kura). Thus unrelated to coward. Related: Cowered; cowering.


quail (v.)

c.1400, have a morbid craving; early 15c., grow feeble or sick; mid-15c., to fade, fail, give way,
of unknown origin, perhaps from Middle Dutch quelen to suffer, be ill, from Proto-Germanic *kwaljan,
from PIE *gwele- (1) to throw, to pierce (see quell). Or from obsolete quail to curdle (late 14c.),
from Old French coailler, from Latin coagulare (see coagulate). Sense of lose heart, shrink, cower
is attested from 1550s. According to OED, common 1520-1650, then rare until 19c., when apparently it
was revived by Scott. Related: Quailed; quailing.
