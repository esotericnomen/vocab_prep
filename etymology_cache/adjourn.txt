adjournment (n.)

mid-15c., from Old French ajornement daybreak, dawn; summons (to appear in court), from ajorner (see
adjourn).


adjourn (v.)

early 14c., ajournen, assign a day (for convening or reconvening), from Old French ajourner (12c.)
meet (at an appointed time), from the phrase &agrave; jorn to a stated day (&agrave; to + journ day,
from Latin diurnus daily; see diurnal).    The sense is to set a date for a re-meeting. Meaning to
close a meeting (with or without intention to reconvene) is from early 15c. Meaning to go in a body
to another place (1640s) is colloquial. The -d- was added 16c. but is unwarranted, as the compound
is not from Latin. Related: Adjourned; adjourning.


Bundestag (n.)

German federal council, 1879, from German Bundestag, from genitive of Bund league, confederacy,
association (related to English band (n.2) and bind (v.)) + tag, literally day; as a verb, tagen,
meaning to sit in conference (see day; also compare adjourn). Hence also Bundesrat, from rat, rath
council (see read (v.)).
