unctuous (adj.)

late 14c., oily, having a greasy or soapy feeling when touched, from Old French unctueus, from
Medieval Latin unctuosus greasy, from Latin unctus act of anointing, from past participle stem of
unguere to anoint (see unguent).    Figurative sense of blandly ingratiating is first recorded 1742,
perhaps in part with a literal sense, but in part a sarcastic usage from unction in the meaning deep
spiritual feeling (1690s), such as comes from having been anointed in the rite of unction. Related:
Unctuously; unctuousness.
