late 14c., oily, having a greasy or soapy feeling when touched, from Old French unctueus, from
Medieval Latin unctuosus greasy, from Latin unctus act of anointing, from past participle stem of
unguere to anoint (see <a href=/index.php?term=unguent&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>unguent</a>).  <br /><br />  Figurative sense of blandly ingratiating is first
recorded 1742, perhaps in part with a literal sense, but in part a sarcastic usage from <a
href=/index.php?term=unction&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>unction</a> in the meaning
deep spiritual feeling (1690s), such as comes from having been anointed in the rite of unction.
