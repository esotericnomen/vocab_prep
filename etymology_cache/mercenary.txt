mercenary (adj.)

1530s, from mercenary (n.), or in part from Latin mercenarius hired, paid, serving for pay.


mercenary (n.)

late 14c., one who works only for hire, from Old French mercenaire mercenary, hireling (13c.) and
directly from Latin mercenarius one who does anything for pay, literally hired, paid, from merces
(genitive mercedis) pay, reward, wages, from merx (see market (n.)).


freelance (n.)

also free lance, free-lance, medieval mercenary warrior, 1820 (Ivanhoe), from free (adj.) + lance
(n.); apparently a coinage of Sir Walter Scott's. Figurative sense is from 1864; specifically of
journalism by 1882.


brigand (n.)

c.1400, lightly armed foot soldier, from Old French brigand (14c.), from Italian brigante trooper,
skirmisher, foot soldier, from brigare (see brigade). Sense of one who lives by pillaging is from
early 15c., reflecting the lack of distinction between professional mercenary armies and armed,
organized criminals.


larceny (n.)

late 15c., with -y (3) + Anglo-French larcin (late 13c.), from Old French larrecin, larcin theft,
robbery (11c.), from Latin latrocinium robbery, freebooting, highway-robbery, piracy, from latro
robber, bandit, also hireling, mercenary, ultimately from a Greek source akin to latron pay, hire,
wages, from a suffixed form of PIE root *le- (1) to get.


purchase (n.)

c.1300, purchas, acquisition, gain; also, something acquired or received, a possession; property,
goods; especially booty, spoil; goods gained by pillage or robbery (to make purchase was to seize by
robbery). Also mercenary soldier, one who fights for booty. From Anglo-French purchace, Old French
porchaz acquisition, gain, profit; seizing, plunder; search pursuit, effort, from Anglo-French
purchaser, Old French porchacier (see purchase (v.)).    From early 14c. as endeavor, effort,
exertion; instigation, contrivance; late 14c. as act of acquiring, procurement. Meaning that which
is bought is from 1580s. The sense of hold or position for advantageously applying power (1711) is
extended from the nautical verb meaning to haul or draw (especially by mechanical power), often used
in reference to hauling up anchors, attested from 1560s. Wif of purchase (early 14c.) was a term for
concubine.
