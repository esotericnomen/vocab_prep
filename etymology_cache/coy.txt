coy (adj.)

early 14c., quiet, modest, demure, from Old French coi, earlier quei quiet, still, placid, gentle,
ultimately from Latin quietus resting, at rest (see quiet (n.)). Meaning shy emerged late 14c.
Meaning unwilling to commit is 1961. Related: Coyly; coyness.


coyote (n.)

1759, American English, from Mexican Spanish coyote, from Nahuatl (Aztecan) coyotl.


decoy (n.)

1610s, perhaps from Dutch kooi cage, used of a pond surrounded by nets, into which wildfowl were
lured for capture, from West Germanic *kaiwa, from Latin cavea cage. The first element is possibly
the Dutch definite article de, mistaken in English as part of the word. But decoy, of unknown
origin, was the name of a card game popular c.1550-1650, and this may have influenced the form of
the word.


decoy (v.)

1650s, from decoy (n.). Related: Decoyed; decoying.


McCoy

as in the real McCoy, 1881, said to be from Scottish the real Mackay (1883), of uncertain origin,
though there are many candidates, including whiskey distilled by A. and M. Mackay of Glasgow (the
phrase the real McCoy became popular during Prohibition to describe liquor); Charles S. Kid McCoy
(1872-1940), former welterweight boxing champ; and a claimant for chief of the northern branch of
the clan Mackay.    By jingo! yes; so it will be. It's the 'real McCoy,' as Jim Hicks says. Nobody
but a devil can find us there. [James S. Bond, The Rise and Fall of the Union Club, Yorkville,
Canada, 1881]
