late 14c., unrestricted; complete, perfect; also not relative to something else (mid-15c.), from
Middle French absolut (14c., Old French asolu, Modern French absolu), from Latin absolutus, past
participle of absolvere to set free, make separate (see <a
href=/index.php?term=absolve&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>absolve</a>).  <br /><br />
Most of the current senses also were in the Latin word. Sense evolution was detached, disengaged,
thus perfect, pure. Meaning despotic (1610s) is from notion of absolute in position. Absolute
monarchy is recorded from 1735 (absolute king is recorded from 1610s); scientific absolute magnitude
(1902), absolute value (1907) are from early 20c. In metaphysics, the absolute that which is
absolute is from 1809.
