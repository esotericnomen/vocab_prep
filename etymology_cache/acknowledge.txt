acknowledge (v.)

1550s, a blend of Middle English aknow (from Old English oncnawan understand, from on + cnawan
recognize; see know) and Middle English knowlechen admit, acknowledge (c.1200; see knowledge). In
the merger, a parasitic -c- slipped in, so that while the kn- became a simple n sound (as in know),
the -c- stepped up to preserve, in this word, the ancient kn- sound. Related: Acknowledged;
