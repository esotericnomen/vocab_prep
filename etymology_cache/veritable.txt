veritable (adj.)

early 15c., from Anglo-French and Old French veritable true, real, truthful, valid (in law), from
verit&eacute; (see verity) + -able. Probably lost mid-17c. and reborrowed or revived after 1830.
Related: Veritably.


atomic (adj.)

1670s as a philosophical term (see atomistic); scientific sense dates from 1811, from atom + -ic.
Atomic number is from 1821; atomic mass is from 1848. Atomic energy first recorded 1906 in modern
sense (as intra-atomic energy from 1903).    March, 1903, was an historic date for chemistry. It is,
also, as we shall show, a date to which, in all probability, the men of the future will often refer
as the veritable beginning of the larger powers and energies that they will control. It was in
March, 1903, that Curie and Laborde announced the heat-emitting power of radium. [Robert Kennedy
Duncan, The New Knowledge, 1906]    Atomic bomb first recorded 1914 in writings of H.G. Wells, who
thought of it as a bomb that would continue to explode indefinitely.  When you can drop just one
atomic bomb and wipe out Paris or Berlin, war will have become monstrous and impossible. [S.
Strunsky, Yale Review, January 1917] Atomic Age is from 1945. Atomical is from 1640s.
