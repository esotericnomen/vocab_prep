1706, a cabinet; an ornamental base structure, from French console a bracket (16c.), of uncertain
origin, possibly from Middle French consolateur, literally one who consoles, word used for carved
human figures supporting cornices, shelves or rails in choir stalls. Another guess connects it to
Latin consolidare. Sense evolved to body of a musical organ (1881), radio cabinet (1925), then
cabinet for a TV, stereo, etc. (1944).
