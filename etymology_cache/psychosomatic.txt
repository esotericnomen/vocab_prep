psychosomatic (adj.)

1847, pertaining to the relation between mind and body, from Greek psykhe- mind (see psyche) +
somatikos, from soma (genitive somatos) body (see somato-). Applied from 1938 to physical disorders
with psychological causes. Etymologically it could as easily apply to emotional disorders with
physical causes, but it is rarely used as such.
