c.1300, custom, habit, in phrase bi rote by heart, of uncertain origin, sometimes said to be
connected with Old French rote route (see <a href=/index.php?term=route&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>route</a> (n.)), or from Latin rota wheel (see <a
href=/index.php?term=rotary&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>rotary</a>), but OED calls
both suggestions groundless.
