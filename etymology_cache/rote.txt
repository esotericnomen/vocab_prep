rote (n.)

c.1300, custom, habit, in phrase bi rote by heart, of uncertain origin, sometimes said to be
connected with Old French rote route (see route (n.)), or from Latin rota wheel (see rotary), but
OED calls both suggestions groundless.


throat (n.)

Old English &thorn;rote (implied in &thorn;rotbolla the Adam's apple, larynx, literally throat
boll), related to &thorn;rutian to swell, from Proto-Germanic *thrut- (cognates: Old High German
drozza, German Drossel, Old Saxon strota, Middle Dutch strote, Dutch strot throat), of uncertain
origin. Italian strozza throat, strozzare to strangle are Germanic loan-words. College slang for
competitive student is 1970s, from cutthroat.
