floccinaucinihilipilification (n.)

action or habit of estimating as worthless, 1741, a combination of four Latin words (flocci, nauci,
nihili, pilifi) all signifying at a small price or for nothing, which were listed together in a rule
of the well-known Eton Latin Grammar. The kind of jocular formation that was possible among educated
men in Britain in those days. Just so, as in praesenti, the opening words of mnemonic lines on
conjugation in Lilley's 16c. Latin grammar, could stand alone as late as 19c. and be understood to
mean rudiments of Latin.
