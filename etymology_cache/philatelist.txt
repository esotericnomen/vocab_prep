stamp-collecting, 1865, from French philat&#233;lie, coined by French stamp collector Georges Herpin
(in Le Collectionneur de Timbres-poste, Nov. 15, 1864), from Greek phil- loving (see <a
href=/index.php?term=philo-&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>philo-</a>) + ateleia
exemption from tax, the closest word Herpin could find in ancient Greek to the concept of postage
stamp (from a- without + telos tax; see <a href=/index.php?term=toll&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>toll</a> (n.)). A reminder of the original function of postage stamps, now
often forgotten: the cost of letter-carrying formerly was paid by the recipient; stamps indicated it
had been pre-paid by the sender, thus the letters were carriage-free.  <blockquote>  It is a pity
that for one of the most popular scientific pursuits one of the least popularly intelligible names
should have been found. [Fowler]</blockquote> Stampomania (1865) also was tried. Stamp-collecting is
from 1862.  Related: Philatelic; philatelism; philatelist.
