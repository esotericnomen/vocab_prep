cursive (adj.)

1784, from French cursif (18c.), from Medieval Latin cursivus running, from Latin cursus a running,
from past participle of currere to run (see current (adj.)). The notion is of written with a running
hand (without raising the pen), originally as opposed to the older uncial hand.


Spencerian (adj.)

1863, pertaining to the penmanship system devised by American penman Platt R. Spencer, the Father of
American Writing (1800-1864), who c.1840 began promoting an elliptical cursive style that became the
standard U.S. business hand from 1850s to early 20c. It had an assured but joyous elegance lacking
in the later Palmer letters. The word also can be a reference to English philosopher Herbert Spencer
(1820-1903).


J

the letter is a late modification of Roman -i-, originally a scribal creation in continental
Medieval Latin to distinguish small -i- in cursive writing from the strokes of other letters,
especially in the final positions of words. But in English, -y- was used for this, and -j- was
introduced c.1600-1640 to take up the consonantal sound that had evolved from -i- since Late Latin
times. This usage first was attested in Spanish, where it was in place before 1600. English
dictionaries continued to lump together words beginning in -i- and -j- until 19c., and -j- formerly
was skipped when letters were used to express serial order.    Used in modern writing to represent
Latin -i- before a, e, o, u in the same syllable, which in Latin was sounded as the consonant in
Modern English you, yam, etc., but the custom is controversial among Latinists:    The character J,
j, which represents the letter sound in some school-books, is an invention of the seventeenth
century, and is not found in MSS., nor in the best texts of the Latin authors. [Lewis]
