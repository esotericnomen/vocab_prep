1784, from French cursif (18c.), from Medieval Latin cursivus running, from Latin cursus a running,
from past participle of currere to run (see <a href=/index.php?term=current&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>current</a> (adj.)). The notion is of written with a running hand (without
raising the pen), originally as opposed to the older <a
href=/index.php?term=uncial&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>uncial</a> hand.
