1620s, from Latin emancipatus, past participle of emancipare declare (someone) free, give up one's
authority over, in Roman law, the freeing of a son or wife from the legal authority (patria
potestas) of the pater familias, to make his or her own way in the world; from ex- out, away (see
ex-) + mancipare deliver, transfer or sell, from mancipum ownership, from manus hand (see manual) +
capere take (see capable). Related: Emancipated; emancipating. Adopted in the cause of religious
toleration (17c.), then anti-slavery (1776). Also used in reference to women who free themselves
from conventional customs (1850).
