gastronomy (n.)

1814, from French gastronomie, coined 1800 by Joseph de Berchoux (1762-1838) as title of poem on
good living, after Gastrologia, title of a now-lost poem of antiquity, quoted by Athenaeus (see
gastrology). Berchoux's word is from gaster + nomos arranging, regulating. Related: Gastronomer.
