plethora (n.)

1540s, a medical word for excess of body fluid, from Late Latin plethora, from Greek plethore
fullness, from plethein be full (see pleio-). Figurative meaning too-muchness, overfullness in any
respect is first recorded 1700. Related: Plethoric.


spinach (n.)

c.1400 (late 13c. as a surname), from Anglo-French spinache, Old French espinache (14c., Modern
French &eacute;pinard, from a form with a different suffix), from Old Proven&ccedil;al espinarc,
which perhaps is via Catalan espinac, from Andalusian Arabic isbinakh, from Arabic isbanakh, from
Persian aspanakh spinach. But OED is not convinced the Middle Eastern words are native, and based on
the plethora of Romanic forms pronounces the origin doubtful.    Popeye, the spinach-eating
superman, debuted in 1929. Old folk etymology connected the word with Latin spina (see spine) or
with Medieval Latin Hispanicum olus. For pronunciation, see cabbage. In 1930s colloquial American
English, it had a sense of nonsense, rubbish, based on a famous New Yorker cartoon of Dec. 8, 1928.
Related: spinaceous.
