thematic (adj.)

1690s, in logic, from Greek thematikos, from thema (genitive thematos; see theme). From 1871 of
writing or discourse. Related: Thematical; thematically.


fandango (n.)

mid-18c., lively Spanish dance, the word of unknown etymology [OED says alleged to be of negro
origin], perhaps related to fado. Fado is lovely, but not lively, so perhaps the link, if any, is
thematic. But the late date argues against it.
