flea (n.)

Old English flea, from Proto-Germanic *flauhaz (cognates: Old Norse flo, Middle Dutch vlo, German
Floh), perhaps related to Old English fleon to flee, with a notion of the jumping parasite, or
perhaps from PIE *plou- flea (cognates: Latin pulex, Greek psylla; see puce).   Flea-bag bed is from
1839; flea circus is from 1886; flea collar is from 1953.    A man named 'Mueller' put on the first
trained-flea circus in America at the old Stone and Austin museum in Boston nearly forty years ago.
Another German named 'Auvershleg' had the first traveling flea circus in this country thirty years
ago. In addition to fairs and museums, I get as high as $25 for a private exhibition. [Professor
William Heckler, quoted in Popular Mechanics, February 1928. Printed at the top of his programs were
Every action is visible to the naked eye and No danger of desertion.]
