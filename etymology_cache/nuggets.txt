hooligan (n.)

1890s, of unknown origin, first found in British newspaper police-court reports in the summer of
1898, almost certainly from the variant form of the Irish surname Houlihan, which figured as a
characteristic comic Irish name in music hall songs and newspapers of the 1880s and '90s.
<blockquote>  As an inventor and adapter to general purposes of the tools used by navvies and
hodmen, Hooligan is an Irish character who occupies week by week the front of a comic literary
journal called Nuggets, one of the series of papers published by Mr. James Henderson at Red Lion
House. Previous to publication in London, Hooligan appears, I believe, in New York in a comic
weekly, and in London he is set off against Schneider, a German, whose contrainventions and
adaptations appear in the Garland (a very similar paper to Nuggets), which also comes from Mr.
Henderson's office. Hooligan and Schneider have been running, I should think, for four or five
years. [Notes and Queries, Oct. 15, 1898]   </blockquote>  Internationalized 20c. in communist
rhetoric as Russian khuligan, opprobrium for scofflaws, political dissenters, etc.
