late 14c., from Middle French filial, from Late Latin filialis of a son or daughter, from Latin
filius son, filia daughter, possibly from a suffixed form of PIE root *bheue- to be, exist, grow
(see <a href=/index.php?term=be&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>be</a>), though *dhe(i)-
to suck, suckle (see <a href=/index.php?term=fecund&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>fecund</a>) is more likely [Watkins].
