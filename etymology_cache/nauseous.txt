Biblical character (Luke xvi:20), the poor man covered in sores; his name was extended in medieval
usage to any poor and visibly diseased person (compare lazar, mid-14c., one deformed and nauseous
with filthy and pestilential diseases [Johnson]). The name is from a Greek rendition of Hebrew
El'azar, literally God has helped.

nauseare to feel seasick, to vomit, also to cause disgust, from nausea (see nausea). Related:
Nauseated; nauseating;  nauseatingly. In its early life it also had transitive senses of to reject
