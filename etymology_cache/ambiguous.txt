1520s, from Latin ambiguus having double meaning, shifting, changeable, doubtful, adjective derived
from ambigere to dispute about, literally to wander, from ambi- about (see <a
href=/index.php?term=ambi-&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>ambi-</a>) + agere drive,
lead, act (see <a href=/index.php?term=act&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>act</a>). Sir
Thomas More (1528) seems to have first used it in English, but <a

to c.1400. Related: Ambiguously; ambiguousness.
