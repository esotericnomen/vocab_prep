ambiguous (adj.)

1520s, from Latin ambiguus having double meaning, shifting, changeable, doubtful, adjective derived
from ambigere to dispute about, literally to wander, from ambi- about (see ambi-) + agere drive,
lead, act (see act). Sir Thomas More (1528) seems to have first used it in English, but ambiguity
dates back to c.1400. Related: Ambiguously; ambiguousness.
