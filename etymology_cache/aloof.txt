aloof (adj.)

1530s, from a- (1) + Middle English loof weather gage, also windward direction, probably from Dutch
loef (Middle Dutch lof) the weather side of a ship. Originally a nautical order to keep the ship's
head to the wind, thus to stay clear of a lee-shore or some other quarter; hence the figurative
sense of at a distance, apart (1580s). Related: Aloofly; aloofness.
