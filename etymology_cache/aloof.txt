1530s, from <a href=/index.php?term=a-&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>a-</a> (1) +
Middle English loof weather gage, also windward direction, probably from Dutch loef (Middle Dutch
lof) the weather side of a ship. Originally a nautical order to keep the ship's head to the wind,
thus to stay clear of a lee-shore or some other quarter; hence the figurative sense of at a
distance, apart (1580s). Related: Aloofly; aloofness.
