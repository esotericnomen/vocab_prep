aloof (adj.)

1530s, from a- (1) + Middle English loof weather gage, also windward direction, probably from Dutch
loef (Middle Dutch lof) the weather side of a ship. Originally a nautical order to keep the ship's
head to the wind, thus to stay clear of a lee-shore or some other quarter; hence the figurative
sense of at a distance, apart (1580s). Related: Aloofly; aloofness.

mugwump (n.)

1832, jocular for great man, boss, important person, American English, from Algonquian (Natick)
mugquomp important person (derived from mugumquomp war leader); used from 1884 of Republicans who
refused to support James G. Blaine's presidential candidacy, hence one who holds himself aloof from
party politics.


standoffish (adj.)

1826, from verbal phrase stand off hold aloof (c.1600); see stand (v.) + off (adv.). Related:
Standoffishly; standoffishness.


sycophant (n.)

1530s (in Latin form sycophanta), informer, talebearer, slanderer, from Middle French sycophante and
directly from Latin sycophanta, from Greek sykophantes false accuser, slanderer, literally one who
shows the fig, from sykon fig (see fig) + phainein to show (see phantasm). Showing the fig was a
vulgar gesture made by sticking the thumb between two fingers, a display which vaguely resembles a
fig, itself symbolic of a vagina (sykon also meant vulva). The modern accepted explanation is that
prominent politicians in ancient Greece held aloof from such inflammatory gestures, but privately
urged their followers to taunt their opponents. The sense of mean, servile flatterer is first
recorded in English 1570s.    The explanation, long current, that it orig. meant an informer against
the unlawful exportation of figs cannot be substantiated. [OED]
