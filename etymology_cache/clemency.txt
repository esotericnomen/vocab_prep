1550s, mildness or gentleness shown in exercise of authority, from Latin clementia calmness,
gentleness, from clemens calm, mild, related to clinare to lean (see lean (v.)) + participial suffix
-menos (also in alumnus). For sense evolution, compare inclined in secondary meaning disposed
favorably. Earlier in same sense was clemence (late 15c.).    Meaning mildness of weather or climate
is 1660s (a sense also in Latin); clement (adj.) is older in both senses, late 15c. and 1620s
respectively, but now is used only in negation and only of the weather.
