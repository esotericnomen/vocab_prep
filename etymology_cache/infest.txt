infestation (n.)

early 15c., from Late Latin infestationem (nominative infestatio) a troubling, disturbing,
molesting, noun of action from past participle stem of infestare (see infest).


infest (v.)

late 15c., to attack, assail, hurt, distress, annoy, from Middle French infester, from Latin
infestare to attack, disturb, trouble, from infestus hostile, dangerous, originally inexorable, not
able to be handled, from in- not, opposite of (see in- (1)) + -festus (able to be) seized. Sense of
swarm over in large numbers first recorded c.1600. Related: Infested; infesting.


manifest (adj.)

late 14c., clearly revealed, from Old French manifest evident, palpable, (12c.), or directly from
Latin manifestus plainly apprehensible, clear, apparent, evident; of offenses, proved by direct
evidence; of offenders, caught in the act, probably from manus hand (see manual) + -festus struck
(compare second element of infest).  Other nations have tried to check ... the fulfillment of our
manifest destiny to overspread the Continent allotted by Providence for the free development of our
yearly multiplying millions. [John O'Sullivan (1813-1895), U.S. Magazine &amp; Democratic Review,
July 1845]  The phrase apparently is O'Sullivan's coinage; the notion is as old as the republic.
