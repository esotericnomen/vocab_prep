Negro (n.)

member of a black-skinned race of Africa, 1550s, from Spanish or Portuguese negro black, from Latin
nigrum (nominative niger) black, dark, sable, dusky, figuratively gloomy, unlucky, bad, wicked, of
unknown origin (perhaps from PIE *nekw-t- night; see Watkins). As an adjective from 1590s. Use with
a capital N- became general early 20c. (e.g. 1930 in New York Times stylebook) in reference to U.S.
citizens of African descent, but because of its perceived association with white-imposed attitudes
and roles the word was ousted late 1960s in this sense by Black (q.v.).<blockquote>Professor Booker
T. Washington, being politely interrogated ... as to whether negroes ought to be called 'negroes' or
'members of the colored race' has replied that it has long been his own practice to write and speak
of members of his race as negroes, and when using the term 'negro' as a race designation to employ
the capital 'N' [Harper's Weekly, June 2, 1906]</blockquote>  Meaning English language as spoken by
U.S. blacks is from 1704. French n&#232;gre is a 16c. borrowing from Spanish negro.
