juggernaut (n.)

1630s, huge wagon bearing an image of the god Krishna, especially that at the town of Puri, drawn
annually in procession in which (apocryphally) devotees allowed themselves to be crushed under its
wheels in sacrifice. Altered from Jaggernaut, a title of Krishna (an incarnation of Vishnu), from
Hindi Jagannath, literally lord of the world, from Sanskrit jagat world (literally moving, present
participle of *jagati he goes, from PIE *gwa- to go, come (see come (v.)) + natha-s lord, master,
from nathate he helps, protects, from PIE *na- to help. The first European description of the
festival is by Friar Odoric (c.1321). Figurative sense of anything that demands blind devotion or
merciless sacrifice is from 1854.
