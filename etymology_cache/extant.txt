Quaker (n.)

1651, said to have been applied to them in 1650 by Justice Bennett at Derby, from George Fox's
admonition to his followers to tremble at the Word of the Lord; but the word was used earlier of
foreign sects given to fits of shaking during religious fervor, and that is likely the source here.
Either way, it never was an official name of the Religious Society of Friends. The word in a literal
sense is attested from early 15c., an agent noun from quake (v.).    There is not a word in the
Scripture, to put David's condition into rime and meeter: sometimes he quaked and trembled, and lay
roaring all the day long, that he watered his bed with his tears: and how can you sing these
conditions (but dishonour the Lord) and say all your bones quake, your flesh trembled, and that you
water your bed with your tears? when you live in pride and haughtiness, and pleasure, and
wantonness; etc. [A Brief Discovery of a threefold estate of Antichrist Now Extant in the world,
etc., an early Quaker work, London, 1653]    Quaker gun (1809, American English) was a log painted
black and propped up to look from a distance like a cannon, so called for the sect's noted pacifism.
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, has been known as the Quaker City since at least 1824. Related:
