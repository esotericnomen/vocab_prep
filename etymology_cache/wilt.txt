wilt (v.)

1690s, to fade, droop, wither, probably an alteration of welk to wilt, probably from Middle Dutch or
Middle Low German welken to wither, cognate with Old High German irwelhen become soft, from Proto-
Germanic *welk-, from PIE root *welg- wet (see welkin). Transitive sense of cause to fade or droop
is from 1809. Related: Wilted; wilting.


fade (v.)

early 14c., lose brightness, grow pale, from Old French fader become weak, wilt, wither, from adj.
fade pale, weak, insipid (12c.), probably from Vulgar Latin *fatidus, some sort of blending of Latin
fatuus silly, tasteless + vapidus flat, flavorless. Related: Faded; fading. As a noun, from c.1300.


hazel (n.)

Old English h&aelig;sl, h&aelig;sel, from Proto-Germanic *hasalaz (cognates: Old Norse hasl, Middle
Dutch hasel, German hasel), from PIE *koselo- hazel (cognates: Latin corulus, Old Irish coll hazel).
Shakespeare (Romeo and Juliet, 1592) was first to use it (in print) in the sense of reddish-brown
color of eyes (in reference to the color of ripe hazel-nuts), when Mercutio accuses Benvolio of
being testy with:Thou wilt quarrell with a man for cracking Nuts, hauing no reason, but because thou
hast hasell eyes.
