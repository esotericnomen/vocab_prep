wilt (v.)

1690s, to fade, droop, wither, probably an alteration of welk to wilt, probably from Middle Dutch or
Middle Low German welken to wither, cognate with Old High German irwelhen become soft, from Proto-
Germanic *welk-, from PIE root *welg- wet (see welkin). Transitive sense of cause to fade or droop
is from 1809. Related: Wilted; wilting.
