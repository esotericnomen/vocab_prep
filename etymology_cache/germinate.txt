germinate (v.)

c.1600, probably a back-formation from germination. Earlier germynen (mid-15c.) was from Latin
germinare. Figurative use from 1640s. Related: Germinated; germinating.


chink (n.1)

a split, crack, 1530s, with parasitic -k + Middle English chine (and replacing this word) fissure,
narrow valley, from Old English cinu, cine fissure, related to cinan to crack, split, gape, common
Germanic (compare Old Saxon and Old High German kinan, Gothic uskeinan, German keimen to germinate;
Middle Dutch kene, Old Saxon kin, German Keim germ; ), from PIE root *geie- to sprout, split open.
The connection being in the notion of bursting open.


key (n.1)

metal piece that works a lock, from Old English c&aelig;g key, of unknown origin, with no certain
cognates other than Old Frisian kei. Perhaps related to Middle Low German keie lance, spear on
notion of tool to cleave with, from Proto-Germanic *ki- to cleaver, split (cognates: German Keil
wedge, Gothic us-kijans come forth, said of seed sprouts, keinan to germinate). But Liberman writes,
The original meaning of *kaig-jo- was presumably '*pin with a twisted end.' Words with the root
*kai- followed by a consonant meaning 'crooked, bent; twisted' are common only in the North Germanic
languages. Modern pronunciation is a northern variant predominating from c.1700; earlier it was
often spelled and pronounced kay.    Figurative sense of that which serves to open or explain was in
Old English; meaning that which holds together other parts is from 1520s. As answer to a test, it is
from chess, short for key move, first move in a solution to a set problem. Musical sense of tone,
note is 15c., but modern sense of scale is 1580s, probably as a translation of Latin clavis or
French clef (see clef; also see keynote). Extended c.1500 to mechanism on a musical instrument. As a
verb meaning to scratch (a car's paint job) with a key it is recorded by 1986.
