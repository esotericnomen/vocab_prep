errant (adj.)

mid-14c., travelling, roving, from Anglo-French erraunt, from two Old French words that were
confused even before they reached English: 1. Old French errant, present participle of errer to
travel or wander, from Late Latin iterare, from Latin iter journey, way, from root of ire to go (see
ion); 2. Old French errant, past participle of errer (see err). The senses fused in English 14c.,
but much of the sense of the latter since has gone with arrant.
