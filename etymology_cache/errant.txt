mid-14c., travelling, roving, from Anglo-French erraunt, from two Old French words that were
confused even before they reached English: 1. Old French errant, present participle of errer to
travel or wander, from Late Latin iterare, from Latin iter journey, way, from root of ire to go (see
<a href=/index.php?term=ion&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>ion</a>); 2. Old French
errant, past participle of errer (see <a href=/index.php?term=err&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>err</a>). The senses fused in English 14c., but much of the sense of the latter
since has gone with <a href=/index.php?term=arrant&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>arrant</a>.
