errant (adj.)

mid-14c., travelling, roving, from Anglo-French erraunt, from two Old French words that were
confused even before they reached English: 1. Old French errant, present participle of errer to
travel or wander, from Late Latin iterare, from Latin iter journey, way, from root of ire to go (see
ion); 2. Old French errant, past participle of errer (see err). The senses fused in English 14c.,
but much of the sense of the latter since has gone with arrant.


arrant (adj.)

late 14c., variant of errant (q.v.); at first merely derogatory, wandering, vagrant; then (1540s)
acquiring a meaning thoroughgoing, downright, notorious.


wander (v.)

Old English wandrian move about aimlessly, wander, from West Germanic *wandran to roam about
(cognates: Old Frisian wondria, Middle Low German, Middle Dutch wanderen, German wandern to wander,
a variant form of the root represented in Old High German wantalon to walk, wander), from PIE root
*wendh- to turn, wind, weave (see wind (v.1)). In reference to the mind, affections, etc., attested
from c.1400. Related: Wandered; wandering. The Wandering Jew of Christian legend first mentioned
13c. (compare French le juif errant, German der ewige Jude).
