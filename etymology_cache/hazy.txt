hazy (adj.)

1620s, hawsey, nautical, of unknown origin. Some connect it with German hase hare, an animal which
plays an important part in Germanic folklore, with many supernatural and unlucky aspects in medieval
times (among the superstitions: a dead hare should not be brought aboard a fishing ship, and the
word hare should not be spoken at sea). Another suggestion is Old English hasu, haswe gray. Related:
Hazily; haziness.
