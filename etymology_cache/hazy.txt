hazy (adj.)

1620s, hawsey, nautical, of unknown origin. Some connect it with German hase hare, an animal which
plays an important part in Germanic folklore, with many supernatural and unlucky aspects in medieval
times (among the superstitions: a dead hare should not be brought aboard a fishing ship, and the
word hare should not be spoken at sea). Another suggestion is Old English hasu, haswe gray. Related:
Hazily; haziness.


muzzy (adj.)

confused, dazed, 1720s, perhaps from mossy, or from dialectal mosey (adj.) moldy, hazy; stupefied
with drink, dull, stupid.


haze (n.)

1706, probably a back-formation of hazy. Sense of confusion, vagueness is 1797. The English
differentiation of haze, mist, fog (and other dialectal words) is unmatched in other tongues, where
the same word generally covers all three and often cloud as well, and this may be seen as an effect
of the English climate on the language.


nebulous (adj.)

late 14c., cloudy, misty, from Latin nebulosus cloudy, misty, foggy, full of vapor, from nebula (see
nebula). The figurative sense of hazy, vague, formless is first attested 1831. Astronomical sense is
from 1670s. Related: Nebulously; nebulousness.
