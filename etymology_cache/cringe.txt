cringe (v.)

early 13c., from causative of Old English cringan give way, fall (in battle), become bent, from
Proto-Germanic *krank- bend, curl up (cognates: Old Norse kringr, Dutch kring, German Kring circle,
ring). Related: Cringed; cringing. As a noun from 1590s.


crinkle (v.)

late 14c., from frequentative of Old English crincan, variant of cringan to bend, yield (see
cringe). Related: Crinkled; crinkling. As a noun from 1590s.


crank (n.)

handle for turning a revolving axis, Old English *cranc, implied in crancst&aelig;f a weaver's
instrument, crencestre female weaver, spinster, from Proto-Germanic base *krank-, and related to
crincan to bend, yield (see crinkle, cringe). English retains the literal sense of the ancient root,
while German and Dutch krank sick, formerly weak, small, is from a figurative use. The 1825
supplement to Jamieson's Scottish dictionary has crank infirm, weak, etc.    The sense of an
eccentric person, especially one who is irrationally fixated, is first recorded 1833, said to be
from the crank of a barrel organ, which makes it play the same tune over and over; but more likely a
back-formation from cranky (q.v.). Meaning methamphetamine attested by 1989.
