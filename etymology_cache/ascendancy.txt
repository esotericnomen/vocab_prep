lechery (n.)

c.1200, from Old French lecherie impertinence, deceit, from lecheor (see lecher).    The priests had
excellent cause to forbid us lechery: this injunction, by reserving to them acquaintance with and
absolution for these private sins, gave them an incredible ascendancy over women, and opened up to
them a career of lubricity whose scope knew no limits. [Marquis de Sade, Philosophy in the Bedroom]
