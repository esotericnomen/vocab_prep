1680s, from Latin deciduus that which falls off, from decidere to fall off, from de- down (see <a
href=/index.php?term=de-&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>de-</a>) + cadere to fall (see
<a href=/index.php?term=case&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>case</a> (n.1)). Originally
with reference to leaves, petals, teeth, etc.; specific sense of trees whose leaves fall off
(opposed to evergreen) is from 1778.
