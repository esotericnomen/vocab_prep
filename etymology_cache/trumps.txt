taroc (n.)

1610s, name of an old card game of Italy, Austria, etc., played originally with a 78-card deck that
includes four suits, four face-cards each, plus the tarot cards as trumps; from Old Italian tarocchi
(plural); see tarot.


exorcise (v.)

c. 1400, to invoke spirits, from Old French exorciser (14c.), from Late Latin exorcizare, from Greek
exorkizein banish an evil spirit; bind by oath (see exorcism). Sense of call up evil spirits to
drive them out became dominant 16c. Formerly also exorcize; a rare case where -ise trumps -ize on
both sides of the Atlantic, perhaps due to influence of exercise. Related: Exorcised; exorcising.


jamboree (n.)

1866, represented as typical of American English, perhaps from jam (n.) on pattern of shivaree
[Barnhart]. For the second element, Weekley suggests French bourree, a kind of rustic dance. Klein
thinks the whole thing is of Hindu origin (but he credits its introduction to English, mistakenly,
to Kipling). Boy Scouts use is from 1920. Noted earlier as a term in cribbage:   Jamboree signifies
the combination of the five highest cards, as, for example, the two Bowers [jacks], Ace, King, and
Queen of trumps in one hand, which entitles the holder to count sixteen points. The holder of such a
hand, simply announces the fact, as no play is necessary; but should he play the hand as a Jambone,
he can count only eight points, whereas he could count sixteen if he played it, or announced it as a
Jamboree. [The American Hoyle, New York, 1864]
