patois (n.)

a provincial dialect, 1640s, from French patois native or local speech (13c.), of uncertain origin,
probably from Old French patoier handle clumsily, to paw, from pate a paw, from Vulgar Latin *patta
(see patten), from notion of clumsy manner of speaking. Compare French pataud properly, a young dog
with big paws, then an awkwardly built fellow [Brachet]. Especially in reference to Jamaican English
from 1934.


piccaninny (n.)

also pickaninny, 1650s, from West Indies patois, formed as a diminutive from Spanish peque&ntilde;o
or Portuguese pequeno little, small, of uncertain origin, related to French petit (see petit
(adj.)). As late as 1836 applied affectionately to any small child or baby, regardless of race.


jazz (n.)

by 1912, American English, first attested in baseball slang; as a type of music, attested from 1913.
Probably ultimately from Creole patois jass strenuous activity, especially sexual intercourse but
also used of Congo dances, from jasm (1860) energy, drive, of African origin (compare Mandingo jasi,
Temne yas), also the source of slang jism.If the truth were known about the origin of the word
'Jazz' it would never be mentioned in polite society. [&Eacute;tude, Sept. 1924] All that jazz et
cetera first recorded 1939.


-kin

diminutive suffix, first attested late 12c. in proper names adopted from Flanders and Holland,
probably from Middle Dutch -kin, properly a double-diminutive, from -k + -in. Equivalent to German
-chen. Also borrowed in Old French as -quin, where it usually has a bad sense.    This suffix, which
is almost barren in French, has been more largely developed in the Picard patois, which uses it for
new forms, such as verquin, a shabby little glass (verre); painequin, a bad little loaf (pain);
Pierrequin poor little Pierre, &amp;c.; [An Etymological Dictionary of the French Language, transl.
G.W. Kitchin, Oxford, 1878]    Used in later Middle English with common nouns. In some words it is
directly from Dutch or Flemish.
