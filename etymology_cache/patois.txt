patois (n.)

a provincial dialect, 1640s, from French patois native or local speech (13c.), of uncertain origin,
probably from Old French patoier handle clumsily, to paw, from pate a paw, from Vulgar Latin *patta
(see patten), from notion of clumsy manner of speaking. Compare French pataud properly, a young dog
with big paws, then an awkwardly built fellow [Brachet]. Especially in reference to Jamaican English
from 1934.
