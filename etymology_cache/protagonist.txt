protagonist (n.)

1670s, principal character in a story, drama, etc., from Greek protagonistes actor who plays the
chief or first part, from protos first (see proto-) + agonistes actor, competitor, from agon contest
(see act (n.)). Meaning leading person in any cause or contest is from 1889. Mistaken sense of
advocate, supporter (1935) is from misreading of Greek protos as Latin pro- for.
