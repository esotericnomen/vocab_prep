1670s, principal character in a story, drama, etc., from Greek protagonistes actor who plays the
chief or first part, from protos first (see <a href=/index.php?term=proto-&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>proto-</a>) + agonistes actor, competitor, from agon contest (see <a
href=/index.php?term=act&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>act</a> (n.)). Meaning leading
person in any cause or contest is from 1889. Mistaken sense of advocate, supporter (1935) is from
misreading of Greek protos as Latin pro- for.
