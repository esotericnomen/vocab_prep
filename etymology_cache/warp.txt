warp (n.)

threads running lengthwise in a fabric, Old English wearp, from Proto-Germanic *warpo- (cognates:
Middle Low German warp, Old High German warf warp, Old Norse varp cast of a net), from PIE *werp- to
turn, bend (see warp (v.)). The warp of fabric is that across which the woof is thrown. Applied in
20c. astrophysics to the fabric of space-time, popularized in noun phrase warp speed by 1960s TV
series Star Trek.
