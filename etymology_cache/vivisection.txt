guinea pig

1660s, native to South America and perhaps so called either because it was first brought back to
Britain aboard Guinea-men, ships that plied the triangle trade between England, Guinea, and South
America [Barnhart, Klein]; or from confusion of Guinea (q.v.) with the South American region of
Guyana (but OED is against this). In the extended sense of one subjected to an experiment it is
first recorded 1920, because they were commonly used in vivisection experiments.
