glean (v.)

early 14c., from Old French glener (Modern French glaner) to glean, from Late Latin glennare make a
collection, perhaps from Gaulish (compare Old Irish do-glinn he collects, gathers, Celt. glan clean,
pure). Figurative sense was earlier in English than the literal one of gather grain left by the
reapers (late 14c.). Related: Gleaned; gleaning.
