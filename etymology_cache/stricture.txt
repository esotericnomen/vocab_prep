c.1400, abnormal narrowing in a body part, from Late Latin strictura contraction, constriction, from
past participle stem of stringere (2) to bind or draw tight (see <a
href=/index.php?term=strain&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>strain</a> (v.)). Sense of
criticism, critical remark is first recorded 1650s, perhaps from the other Latin word stringere to
touch lightly (see <a href=/index.php?term=strigil&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
