generate (v.)

c.1500, to beget (offspring), a back-formation from generation or else from Latin generatus, past
participle of generare to beget, produce (see generation); originally to beget; in reference to
natural forces, conditions, substances, etc., attested from 1560s. Related: Generated; generating.


generative (adj.)

early 15c., from generate + -ive. Use in linguistics is attested by 1959. Related: Generativity.


regeneration (n.)

mid-14c., from Late Latin regenerationem (nominative regeneratio) a being born again, noun of action
from past participle stem of Latin regenerare make over, generate again, from re- again (see re-) +
generare to produce (see generation). Originally spiritual; of animal tissue, early 15c.; of
forests, 1888.


procreation (n.)

late 14c., process of begetting offspring, from Old French procreacion (14c., Modern French
pr&#243;creation) and directly from Latin procreationem (nominative procreatio) a begetting,
generation, noun of action from past participle stem of procreare bring forth (offspring), beget,
generate, produce, from pro- forth (see pro-) + creare create (see create).


fetus (n.)

late 14c., the young while in the womb or egg, from Latin fetus (often, incorrectly, foetus) the
bearing, bringing forth, or hatching of young, from Latin base *fe- to generate, bear, also to suck,
suckle (see fecund).    In Latin, fetus sometimes was transferred figuratively to the newborn
creature itself, or used in a sense of offspring, brood (as in Horace's Germania quos horrida
parturit Fetus), but this was not the basic meaning. Also used of plants, in the sense of fruit,
produce, shoot. The spelling foetus is sometimes attempted as a learned Latinism, but it is not
historic.
