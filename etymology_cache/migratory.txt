migratory (adj.)

1753, from Latin migrat-, past participle stem of migrare to movefrom one place to another (see
migration) + -ory.


widgeon (n.)

migratory wild duck, 1510s, perhaps from a northern variant of French vigeon, which some trace to
Latin vipionem (nominative vipio), a kind of small crane, a Balearic word, perhaps imitative, with
an evolution of form similar to that which produced pigeon. But the French word is later than the
English one, and OED finds all this very dubious. Applied to different species in Europe and
America.


wren (n.)

small, migratory singing bird, Old English wrenna, metathesis variation of earlier werna, a Germanic
word of uncertain origin. Compare Icelandic rindill, Old High German wrendo, wrendilo wren. The
bird's name in other languages usually denotes royalty (such as Latin regulus), in reference to its
golden crest.


swallow (n.1)

type of migratory bird (family Hirundinidae), Old English swealwe swallow, from Proto-Germanic
*swalwon (cognates: Old Saxon, Old Norse, Old Frisian, Swedish svala, Danish svale, Middle Dutch
zwalewe, Dutch zwaluw, Old High German swalawa, German Schwalbe), from PIE *swol-wi- (cognates:
Russian solowej, Slovak slavik, Polish s&#322;owik nightingale). The etymological sense is disputed.
Popularly regarded as harbingers of summer; swallows building nests on or near a house is considered
good luck.


quail (n.)

migratory game bird, late 14c. (early 14c. as a surname (Quayle), from Old French quaille (Modern
French caille), perhaps via Medieval Latin quaccula (source also of Proven&ccedil;al calha, Italian
quaglia, Old Spanish coalla), or directly from a Germanic source (compare Dutch kwakkel, Old High
German quahtala quail, German Wachtel, Old English wihtel), imitative of the bird's cry. Or the
English word might be directly from Proto-Germanic. Slang meaning young attractive woman first
recorded 1859.
