shard (n.)

also sherd, Old English sceard incision, cleft, gap; potshard, a fragment, broken piece, from Proto-
Germanic *skardas (cognates: Middle Dutch schaerde a fragment, a crack, Dutch schaard a flaw, a
fragment, German Scharte a notch, Danish skaar chink, potsherd), a past participle from the root of
Old English sceran to cut (see shear). Meaning fragment of broken earthenware developed in late Old
English. Used late 14c. as scale of a dragon. French &eacute;charde prickle, splinter is a Germanic
loan-word.


potsherd (n.)

early 14c., from pot (n.1) + Middle English schoord, from Old English sceard (see shard).


cleric (n.)

1620s (also in early use as an adjective), from Church Latin clericus clergyman, priest, noun use of
adjective meaning priestly, belonging to the clerus; from Ecclesiastical Greek klerikos pertaining
to an inheritance, but in Greek Christian jargon by 2c., of the clergy, belonging to the clergy, as
opposed to the laity; from kleros a lot, allotment; piece of land; heritage, inheritance, originally
a shard or wood chip used in casting lots, related to klan to break (see clastic).   Kleros was used
by early Greek Christians for matters relating to ministry, based on Deut. xviii:2 reference to
Levites as temple assistants: Therefore shall they have no inheritance among their brethren: the
Lord is their inheritance, kleros being used as a translation of Hebrew nahalah inheritance, lot. Or
else it is from the use of the word in Acts i:17. A word taken up in English after clerk (n.)
shifted to its modern meaning.
