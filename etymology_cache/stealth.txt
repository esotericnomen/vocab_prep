mid-13c., theft, action or practice of stealing, from a probable Old English *st&aelig;l&thorn;,
which is related to stelen (see <a href=/index.php?term=steal&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>steal</a> (v.)), from Proto-Germanic *st&aelig;litho (cognates: Old Norse
stul&thorn;r), with Proto-Germanic abstract noun suffix *-itho (see <a
href=/index.php?term=-th&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>-th</a> (2)).  <br /><br />
Compare heal/health, weal/wealth. Sense of secret action developed c.1300, but the word also
retained its etymological sense into 18c. Got a boost as an adjective from stealth fighter, stealth
bomber, radar-evading U.S. military aircraft, activated 1983.
