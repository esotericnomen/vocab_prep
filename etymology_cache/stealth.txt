stealth (n.)

mid-13c., theft, action or practice of stealing, from a probable Old English *st&aelig;l&thorn;,
which is related to stelen (see steal (v.)), from Proto-Germanic *st&aelig;litho (cognates: Old
Norse stul&thorn;r), with Proto-Germanic abstract noun suffix *-itho (see -th (2)).    Compare
heal/health, weal/wealth. Sense of secret action developed c.1300, but the word also retained its
etymological sense into 18c. Got a boost as an adjective from stealth fighter, stealth bomber,
radar-evading U.S. military aircraft, activated 1983.
