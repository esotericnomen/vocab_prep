ventilate (v.)

early 15c., to scatter, disperse (as the wind does), from Latin ventilatus, past participle of
ventilare to brandish, toss in the air, winnow, fan, agitate, set in motion, from ventulus a breeze,
diminutive of ventus wind (see wind (n.1)). Original notion is of cleaning grain by tossing it in
the air and letting the wind blow away the chaff. Meaning supply a room with fresh air first
recorded 1743 (see ventilation). Formerly with diverse slang senses, including shoot (someone),
recorded from 1875. Related: Ventilated; ventilating.

ventilation (n.)

process of replacing foul air in an enclosed place with fresh, pure air, 1660s, from Latin
ventilationem (nominative ventilatio) an exposing to the air, noun of action from past participle
stem of ventilare (see ventilate).

railroad (v.)

to convict quickly and perhaps unjustly, 1873, American English, from railroad (n.).    A person
knowing more than might be desirable of the affairs, or perhaps the previous life of some powerful
individual, high in authority, might some day ventilate his knowledge, possibly before a court of
justice; but if his wisdom is railroaded to State's prison, his evidence becomes harmless.
[Wanderings of a Vagabond, New York, 1873]    Related: Railroaded; railroading. An earlier verb
sense was to have a mania for building railroads (1847).
