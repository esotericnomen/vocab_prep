advocacy (n.)

late 14c., from Old French avocacie (14c.), from Medieval Latin advocatia, noun of state from Latin
advocatus (see advocate (n.)).


feminism (n.)

1851, state of being feminine; sense of advocacy of women's rights is 1895, from French
f&eacute;minisme (1837); see feminine + -ism.

suasion (n.)

late 14c., from Old French suasion (14c.) and directly from Latin suasionem (nominative suasio) a
recommending, advocacy, support, noun of action from past participle stem of suadere to urge,
incite, promote, advise, persuade, literally recommend as good (related to suavis sweet), from PIE
*swad- sweet, pleasant (see sweet (adj.)). Survives chiefly in phrase moral suasion (1640s). Latin
Suada was the goddess of persuasion.


imperialism (n.)

1826, advocacy of empire, originally in a Napoleonic context, also of Rome and of British foreign
policy, from imperial + -ism. At times in British usage (and briefly in U.S.) with a neutral or
positive sense relating to national interests or the spread of the benefits of Western civilization,
but from the begining usually more or less a term of reproach. General sense of one country's rule
over another, first recorded 1878. Picked up disparagingly in Communist jargon by 1918.    It is the
old story of 1798, when French republicanism sick of its own folly and misdeeds, became
metamorphosed into imperialism, and consoled itself for its incapacity to found domestic freedom by
putting an iron yoke upon Europe, and covering it with blood and battle-fields. [Francis Lloyd, St.
James's Magazine, January 1842]
