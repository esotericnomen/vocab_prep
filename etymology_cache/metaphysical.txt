Medieval Latin metaphysicalis, from Medieval Latin metaphysica (see <a
href=/index.php?term=metaphysics&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>metaphysics</a>). It
came to be used in the sense of abstract, speculative (among others by Johnson, who applied it to
certain 17c. poets, notably Donne and Cowley, who used witty conceits and abstruse imagery).
