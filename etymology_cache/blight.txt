blight (v.)

afflict with blight, 1660s (implied in blighted), from blight (n.). Figurative use by 1712. Related:

blight (n.)

1610s, origin obscure; according to OED it emerged into literary speech from the talk of gardeners
and farmers, perhaps ultimately from Old English bl&aelig;ce, bl&aelig;c&eth;u, a scrofulous skin
condition and/or from Old Norse blikna become pale. Used in a general way of agricultural diseases,
sometimes with suggestion of invisible baleful influence; hence figurative sense of anything which
withers hopes or prospects or checks prosperity (1828). Compare slang blighter. Urban blight
attested by 1935.


blighter (n.)

1822, thing which blights, agent noun from blight (v.). British colloquial sense of contemptible
person (often jocular) is recorded from 1896.


ergot (n.)

fungal disease of rye and other grasses, 1680s, from French ergot, from Old French argot cock's spur
(12c.), of unknown origin. The blight so called from the shape the fungus forms on the diseased
grain. Ergotism disease caused by eating ergot-infected breadstuffs, first recorded 1853. An
alkaloid from the fungus, ergotamine (1921) is used to treat migraines.
