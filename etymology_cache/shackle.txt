Old English sceacel shackle, fetter, probably also in a general sense a link or ring of a chain,
from Proto-Germanic *skakula- (cognates: Middle Dutch, Dutch schakel link of a chain, ring of a net,
Old Norse sk&ouml;kull pole of a carriage), of uncertain origin. According to OED, the common notion
of something to fasten or attach makes a connection with shake unlikely. Figurative use from early
13c. Related: Shackledom marriage (1771); shackle-bone the wrist (1570s).
