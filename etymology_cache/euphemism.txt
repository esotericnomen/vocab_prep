1650s, from Greek euphemismos use of a favorable word in place of an inauspicious one, from
euphemizein speak with fair words, use words of good omen, from eu- good (see eu-) + pheme speaking,
from phanai speak (see fame (n.)).    In ancient Greece, the superstitious avoidance of words of
ill-omen during religious ceremonies, or substitutions such as Eumenides the Gracious Ones for the
Furies (see also Euxine). In English, a rhetorical term at first; broader sense of choosing a less
distasteful word or phrase than the one meant is first attested 1793. Related: Euphemistic;
