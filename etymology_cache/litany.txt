c.1200, from Old French letanie and directly from Medieval Latin letania, Late Latin litania (source
also of Spanish letania, Italian litania), from Greek litaneia litany, an entreating, from lite
prayer, supplication, entreaty, of unknown origin. From notion of monotonous enumeration of
petitions in Christian prayer services came generalized sense of repeated series, early 19c.,
borrowed from French.  <blockquote>  For those who know the Greek words, a litany is a series of
prayers, a liturgy is a canon of public service; the latter in practice includes prayer, but does
not say so. [Fowler]  </blockquote>
