we (pron.)

Old English we, first person plural pronoun, I and another or others, from Proto-Germanic *wiz
(cognates: Old Saxon wi, Old Norse ver, Danish vi, Old Frisian wi, Dutch wij, Old High German and
German wir, Gothic weis we), from PIE *we- (cognates: Sanskrit vayam, Old Persian vayam, Hittite
wesh we, Old Church Slavonic ve we two, Lithuanian vedu we two).    The royal we (use of plural
pronoun to denote oneself) is at least as old as Beowulf (c.725); use by writers to establish an
impersonal style is also from Old English; it was especially common 19c. in unsigned editorials, to
suggest staff consensus, and was lampooned as such since at least 1853 (see wegotism).
