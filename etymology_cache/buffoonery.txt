English goffe may be from Middle English goffen speak in a frivolous manner, possibly from Old
English gegaf buffoonery, and gaffetung scolding. Sense of a blunder is c.1954, probably influenced
by gaffe.


farce (n.)

late 14c., force-meat, stuffing; 1520s, as a type of dramatic work, from Middle French farce comic
interlude in a mystery play (16c.), literally stuffing, from Old French farcir to stuff, (13c.),
from Latin farcire to stuff, cram, of unknown origin, perhaps related to frequens crowded.    The
pseudo-Latin farsia was applied 13c. in France and England to praise phrases inserted into
liturgical formulae (for example between kyrie and eleison), then in Old French farce was extended
to the impromptu buffoonery among actors that was a feature of religious stage plays.
