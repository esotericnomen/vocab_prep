allay (v.)

Old English alecgan to put down, remit, give up, a Germanic compound (cognates: Gothic uslagjan, Old
High German irleccan, German erlegen), from a- down, aside + lecgan to lay (see lay).    Early
Middle English pronunciations of -y- and -g- were not always distinct, and the word was confused in
Middle English with various senses of Romanic-derived alloy and allege, especially the latter in an
obsolete sense of to lighten, from Latin ad- to + levis (see lever).  <blockquote>Amid the
overlapping of meanings that thus arose, there was developed a perplexing network of uses of allay
and allege, that belong entirely to no one of the original vbs., but combine the senses of two or
more of them. [OED]</blockquote>The double -l- is 17c., a mistaken Latinism. Related: Allayed;
allaying.
