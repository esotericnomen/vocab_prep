Old English alecgan to put down, remit, give up, a Germanic compound (cognates: Gothic uslagjan, Old
High German irleccan, German erlegen), from a- down, aside + lecgan to lay (see <a
href=/index.php?term=lay&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>lay</a>).  <br /><br />  Early
Middle English pronunciations of -y- and -g- were not always distinct, and the word was confused in
Middle English with various senses of Romanic-derived <a
href=/index.php?term=alloy&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>alloy</a> and <a
href=/index.php?term=allege&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>allege</a>, especially the
latter in an obsolete sense of to lighten, from Latin ad- to + levis (see <a
href=/index.php?term=lever&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>lever</a>).  <blockquote>Amid
the overlapping of meanings that thus arose, there was developed a perplexing network of uses of
allay and allege, that belong entirely to no one of the original vbs., but combine the senses of two
or more of them. [OED]</blockquote>The double -l- is 17c., a mistaken Latinism. Related: Allayed;
allaying.
