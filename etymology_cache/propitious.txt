late 14c., from Old French cimetiere graveyard (12c.), from Late Latin coemeterium, from Greek
koimeterion sleeping place, dormitory, from koiman to put to sleep, keimai I lie down, from PIE root
*kei- to lie, rest, also bed, couch, hence secondary sense of beloved, dear (cognates: Greek

used in reference to the sleep of death. An Old English word for cemetery was licburg.
