1640s, from French prolifique (16c.), from Medieval Latin prolificus, from Latin proles offspring +
root of facere to make (see <a href=/index.php?term=factitious&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>factitious</a>). Latin proles is contracted from *pro-oles, from PIE *pro-al-,
from *pro- forth (see <a href=/index.php?term=pro-&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>pro-</a>) + *al- to grow, nourish (see <a
href=/index.php?term=old&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>old</a>). Related: Prolifical
(c.1600).  <blockquote> <b>Prolific</b> is in common use, but to make a satisfactory noun from it
has passed the wit of man. [Fowler]</blockquote>
