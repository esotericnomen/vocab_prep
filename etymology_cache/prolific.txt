prolific (adj.)

1640s, from French prolifique (16c.), from Medieval Latin prolificus, from Latin proles offspring +
root of facere to make (see factitious). Latin proles is contracted from *pro-oles, from PIE *pro-
al-, from *pro- forth (see pro-) + *al- to grow, nourish (see old). Related: Prolifical (c.1600).
<blockquote> <b>Prolific</b> is in common use, but to make a satisfactory noun from it has passed
the wit of man. [Fowler]</blockquote>
