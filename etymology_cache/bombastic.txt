bombastic (adj.)

1704, inflated, from bombast + -ic. Meaning given to bombastic language is from 1727.


puffy (adj.)

1610s, of wind, gusty, from puff + -y (2). Of other things, swollen, from 1660s. Earliest attested
use is figurative, bombastic (1590s). Related: Puffily; puffiness.


Ossianic (adj.)

1808, in reference to Oisin, name of a legendary Gaelic bard, literally little fawn; James
Macpherson claimed to have collected and translated his works (1760-1763) under the name Ossian, and
the poetic prose sparked a Celtic revival and fascination with the glamor of the lost world of the
bards. The work turned out to be Macpherson's forgery, and the style later was regarded as
bombastic, but the resulting swerve in European literature was real.


grandiloquence (n.)

1580s, from Latin grandiloquentia, from grandiloquus using lofty speech, bombastic, from grandis big
(see grand (adj.)) + -loquus speaking, from loqui to speak (see locution).
