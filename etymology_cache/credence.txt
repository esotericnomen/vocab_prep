credence (n.)

mid-14c., from Medieval Latin credentia belief, from Latin credentum (nominative credens), past
participle of credere believe, trust (see credo).


credentials (n.)

letters entitling the bearer to certain credit or confidence, 1670s, from Medieval Latin
credentialis, from credentia (see credence). Probably immediately as a shortening of letters
credential (1520s, with French word order); earlier was letter of credence (mid-14c.).


credenza (n.)

1883, an Italian sideboard, from Italian credenza, literally belief, credit, from Medieval Latin
credentia (see credence).    The same evolution that produced this sense in Italian also worked on
the English word credence, which in Middle English also meant act or process of testing the nature
or character of food before serving it as a precaution against poison, a former practice in some
royal or noble households. Because of that, in medieval times it also meant a side-table or side-
board on which the food was placed to be tasted before serving; hence, in later use, a cupboard or
cabinet for the display of plate, etc. These senses fell away in English, and the modern furniture
piece, which begins to be mentioned in domestic interiors from c.1920, took its name from Italian,
perhaps as a more elegant word than homely sideboard.


faith (n.)

mid-13c., duty of fulfilling one's trust, from Old French feid, foi faith, belief, trust,
confidence, pledge, from Latin fides trust, faith, confidence, reliance, credence, belief, from root
of fidere to trust, from PIE root *bheidh- (source also of Greek pistis; see bid). For sense
evolution, see belief. Theological sense is from late 14c.; religions called faiths since c.1300.
