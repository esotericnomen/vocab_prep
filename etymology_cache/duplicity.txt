early 15c., from Old French duplicite (13c.), from Late Latin duplicitatem (nominative duplicitas)
doubleness, in Medieval Latin ambiguity, noun of quality from duplex (genitive duplicis) twofold.
The notion is of being double in one's conduct (compare Greek diploos treacherous, double-minded,
literally twofold, double).
