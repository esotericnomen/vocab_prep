Jehovah

1530, Tyndale's erroneous transliteration of Hebrew Tetragramaton YHWH using vowel points of Adhonai
my lord (see Yahweh). Used for YHWH (the full name being too sacred for utterance) in four places in
the Old Testament in the KJV where the usual translation lord would have been inconvenient; taken as
the principal and personal name of God.    The vowel substitution was originally made by the
Masoretes as a direction to substitute Adhonai for the ineffable name. European students of Hebrew
took this literally, which yielded Latin JeHoVa (first attested in writings of Galatinus, confessor
to Leo X, 1516). Jehovah's Witnesses member of Watchtower Bible and Tract Society first attested
1933; the organization founded c.1879 by Charles Taze Russell (1852-1916); the name from Isa.
xliii:10.
