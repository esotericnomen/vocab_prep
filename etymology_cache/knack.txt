knack (n.)

mid-14c., deception, trick, device, of uncertain origin, probably from a Low German word meaning a
sharp sounding blow (compare Middle English knak, late 14c.; German knacken to crack), of imitative
origin. Sense of special skill is first recorded 1580s, if this is in fact the same word.


knick-knack (n.)

also knickknack, 1570s, reduplication of knack stratagem, trick.


survivor (n.)

early 15c. in the legal sense of one who outlives another, agent noun from survive. Meaning one who
has a knack for pulling through adversity is attested from 1971. Survivor syndrome is first recorded

bagatelle (n.)

1630s, a trifle, from French bagatelle knick-knack, bauble, trinket (16c.), from Italian bagatella a
trifle, diminutive of Latin baca berry. As a piece of light music, it is attested from 1827.


bibelot (n.)

small curio, 1873, from French bibelot knick-knack, from Old French beubelet trinket, jewel (12c.),
from belbel plaything, a reduplication of bel pretty.


hang (n.)

late 15c., a sling, from hang (v.). Meaning a curtain is from c.1500; that of the way cloth hangs is
from 1797. To get the hang of (something) become capable is from 1834, American English. Perhaps
originally in reference to a certain tool or feat, but, if so, its origin has been forgotten. It
doesn't seem to have been originally associated with drapery or any other special use of hang.
'To get the hang of a thing,' is to get the knack, or habitual facility of doing it well. A low
expression frequently heard among us. In the Craven Dialect of England is the word hank, a habit;
from which this word hang may perhaps be derived. [John Russell Bartlett, Dictionary of
Americanisms, New York, 1848]
