principle, opinion, or dogma maintained as true by a person, sect, school, etc., properly a thing
held (to be true), early 15c., from Latin tenet he holds, third person singular present indicative
of tenere to hold, grasp, keep, have possession, maintain, also reach, gain, acquire, obtain; hold
back, repress, restrain; figuratively hold in mind, take in, understand.  <br /><br />  The Latin
word is from PIE root *ten- to stretch (cognates: Sanskrit tantram loom, tanoti stretches, lasts;
Persian tar string; Lithuanian tankus compact, i.e. tightened; Greek teinein to stretch, tasis a
stretching, tension, tenos sinew, tetanos stiff, rigid, tonos string, hence sound, pitch; Latin
tendere to stretch, tenuis thin, rare, fine; Old Church Slavonic tento cord; Old English &thorn;ynne
thin). Connecting notion between stretch and hold is cause to maintain. The modern sense is probably
because tenet was used in Medieval Latin to introduce a statement of doctrine.
