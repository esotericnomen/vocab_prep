1540s, in halcyon dayes (Latin alcyonei dies, Greek alkyonides hemerai), 14 days of calm weather at
the winter solstice, when a mythical bird (identified with the kingfisher) was said to breed in a
nest floating on calm seas. From halcyon (n.), late 14c., from Latin halcyon, from Greek halkyon,
variant (perhaps a misspelling) of alkyon kingfisher, from hals sea, salt (see <a
href=/index.php?term=halo-&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>halo-</a>) + kyon conceiving,
present participle of kyein to conceive, literally to swell, from PIE root *keue- to swell.
Identified in mythology with Halcyone, daughter of Aeolus, who when widowed threw herself into the
sea and became a kingfisher.
