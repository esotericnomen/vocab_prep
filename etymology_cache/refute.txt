1510s, refuse, reject, from Middle French r&#233;futer (16c.) and directly from Latin refutare drive
back; rebut, disprove; repress, repel, resist, oppose, from re- back (see <a
href=/index.php?term=re-&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>re-</a>) + -futare to beat,
probably from PIE root *bhau- to strike down (see <a href=/index.php?term=bat&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>bat</a> (n.1)).  <br /><br />  Meaning prove wrong dates from 1540s. Since
c.1964 linguists have frowned on the subtle shift in meaning towards to deny, as it is used in
connection with allegation. Related: Refuted; refuting.
