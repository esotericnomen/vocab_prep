consensus (n.)

1854 as a term in physiology; 1861 of persons; from Latin consensus agreement, accord, past
participle of consentire (see consent). There is an isolated instance of the word from 1633.


consensual (adj.)

1754, having to do with consent, from stem of Latin consensus (see consensus) + -al (1). Meaning by
consent is attested from 1800.


reasonable (adj.)

c.1300, having sound judgment, sane, rational, from Old French raisonable, from Latin rationabilis,
from ratio (see reason (n.)).What the majority of people consider to be 'reasonable' is that about
which there is agreement, if not among all, at least among a substantial number of people;
'reasonable' for most people, has nothing to do with reason, but with consensus. [Erich Fromm, The
Heart of Man, 1968]Meaning moderate in price is recorded from 1660s. Related: Reasonably.


we (pron.)

Old English we, first person plural pronoun, I and another or others, from Proto-Germanic *wiz
(cognates: Old Saxon wi, Old Norse ver, Danish vi, Old Frisian wi, Dutch wij, Old High German and
German wir, Gothic weis we), from PIE *we- (cognates: Sanskrit vayam, Old Persian vayam, Hittite
wesh we, Old Church Slavonic ve we two, Lithuanian vedu we two).    The royal we (use of plural
pronoun to denote oneself) is at least as old as Beowulf (c.725); use by writers to establish an
impersonal style is also from Old English; it was especially common 19c. in unsigned editorials, to
suggest staff consensus, and was lampooned as such since at least 1853 (see wegotism).
