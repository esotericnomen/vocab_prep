Old English a&eth; oath, judicial swearing, solemn appeal to deity in witness of truth or a promise,
from Proto-Germanic *aithaz (cognates: Old Norse ei&eth;r, Swedish ed, Old Saxon, Old Frisian eth,
Middle Dutch eet, Dutch eed, German eid, Gothic ai&thorn;s oath), from PIE *oi-to- an oath
(cognates: Old Irish oeth oath). Common to Celtic and Germanic, possibly a loan-word from one to the
other, but the history is obscure. In reference to careless invocations of divinity, from late 12c.
