French abeance aspiration, desire, noun of condition of abeer aspire after, gape from &agrave; at

legal term, condition of a person in expectation or hope of receiving property; it turned around in

the source of English bay (n.2) recessed space, as in bay window.

mingle, from com- together (see com-) + fundere to pour (see found (v.2)).    The figurative sense
of confuse, fail to distinguish, mix up emerged in Latin, passed into French and thence into Middle
English, where it is mostly found in Scripture; the sense of destroy utterly is recorded in English
from c.1300. Meaning perplex is late 14c. The Latin past participle confusus, meanwhile, became
confused (q.v.).
