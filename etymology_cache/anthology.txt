anthology (n.)

1630s, collection of poetry, from Latin anthologia, from Greek anthologia collection of small poems
and epigrams by several authors, literally flower-gathering, from anthos a flower (see anther) +
logia collection, collecting, from legein gather (see lecture (n.)). Modern sense (which emerged in
Late Greek) is metaphoric, flowers of verse, small poems by various writers gathered together.
