nake (v.)

to make naked, early 14c., from naked, perhaps with misapprehension of the -d as a past tense
suffix. Marked as Obs[olete] exc[ept] Sc[ottish] in OED. Earlier was naken to strip naked (mid-

loco-foco (n.)

self-igniting cigar or match, 1839 (but presumably older), American English, of unknown origin,
perhaps from a misapprehension of the meaning of the first element of locomotive as self- + Spanish
fuego fire. During one heated political meeting in N.Y., the lights went out and the delegates used
such matches to relight them, thence the name loco-foco entered U.S. political jargon (1837),
usually applied to a radical faction of the Democratic Party, but by the Whigs applied to all
Democrats.
