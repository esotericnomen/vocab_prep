psychopathic (adj.)

1847, from psychopathy on model of German psychopatisch, from Greek psykhe- mind (see psyche) +
pathos suffering (see pathos).


psycho (adj.)

1927, shortening of psychological; 1936 (Raymond Chandler) as shortening of psychopathic (adj.).


psychopath (n.)

1885, in the criminal psychology sense, a back-formation from psychopathic.    The Daily Telegraph
had, the other day, a long article commenting on a Russian woman who had murdered a little girl. A
Dr. Balinsky prevailed upon the jury to give a verdict of acquittal, because she was a psychopath.
The Daily Telegraph regards this term as a new coinage, but it has been long known amongst
Spiritualists, yet in another sense. [The Medium and Daybreak, Jan. 16, 1885]    The case alluded
to, and the means of acquittal, were briefly notorious in England and brought the word into currency
in the modern sense.
