Figurative sense of excite, stimulate (as if by electricity) first recorded 1853. Meaning to coat
with metal by means of galvanic electricity (especially to plate iron with tin, but now typically to
plate it with zinc) is from 1839.<blockquote>He'll swear that in her dancing she cuts all others
out,<br />Though like a Gal that's galvanized, she throws her legs about.<br />[Thomas Hood, Love
