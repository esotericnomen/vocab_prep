1620s, from Italian gusto taste, from Latin gustus a tasting, related to gustare to taste, take a
little of, from PIE root *geus- to taste, choose (cognates: Sanskrit jus- enjoy, be pleased, Avestan
zaosa- pleasure, Old Persian dau&#353;- enjoy), a root that forms words for taste in Greek and
Latin, but mostly meaning try or choose in Germanic and Celtic (such as Old English cosan, cesan to
choose, Gothic kausjan to test, to taste of, Old High German koston try, German kosten taste of).
The semantic development could have been in either direction. In English, guste organ of taste,
sense of taste, is mid-15c., from French.
