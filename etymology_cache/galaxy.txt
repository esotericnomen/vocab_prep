late 14c., from Old French galaxie, from Late Latin galaxias Milky Way, from Greek galaxias (adj.),
in galaxias kyklos, literally milky circle, from gala (genitive galaktos) milk (see <a
href=/index.php?term=lactation&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>lactation</a>). The
technical astronomical sense emerged 1848. Figurative sense of brilliant assembly of persons is from
1580s. Milky Way is a translation of Latin via lactea.<blockquote>See yonder, lo, the Galaxy&#235;
Which men clepeth the Milky Wey, For hit is whyt. [Chaucer, House of Fame]</blockquote>  Astronomers
began to speculate by mid-19c. that some of the spiral nebulae they could see in telescopes were
actually immense and immensely distant structures the size and shape of the Milky Way. But the
matter was not settled until the 1920s.
