phoenix (n.)

Old English and Old French fenix, from Medieval Latin phenix, from Latin phoenix, from Greek
phoinix, mythical bird of Arabia which flew to Egypt every 500 years to be reborn, also the date
(fruit and tree), also Phoenician, literally purple-red, perhaps a foreign word (Egyptian has been
suggested), or from phoinos blood-red. Exact relation and order of the senses in Greek is
unclear.<blockquote>&ETH;one wudu wearda&thorn; wundrum f&aelig;gerfugel fe&thorn;rum se is fenix
hatan[Phoenix, c.900]</blockquote>Spelling assimilated to Greek 16c. (see ph). Figurative sense of
that which rises from the ashes of what was destroyed is attested from 1590s. The city in Arizona,
U.S., so called because it was founded in 1867 on the site of an ancient Native American settlement.
