class=crossreference>marine</a> (adj.). Meaning collective shipping of a country is from 1660s.
Meaning soldier who serves on a ship is from 1670s, a separate borrowing from French marine, from
the French adjective. Phrase tell that to the marines (1806) originally was the first half of a
retort expressing skepticism:  <blockquote>  Upon my soul, sir, answered the lieutenant, when I
thought she scorned my passion, I wept like a child.  <br /><br />  Belay there! cried the captain;
you may tell that to the marines, but I'll be d----d if the sailors will believe it. [John Moore,
The Post-Captain; or, the Wooden Walls Well Manned, 1805]  </blockquote>  The book, a rollicking sea
romance/adventure novel, was popular in its day and the remark is a recurring punch line in it
(repeated at least four times). It was written by naval veteran John Davis (1774-1854) but published
under the name John Moore. Walsh records that, The marines are among the 'jolly' jack-tars a
proverbially gullible lot, capable of swallowing any yarn, in size varying from a yawl-boat to a
full-rigged frigate.
