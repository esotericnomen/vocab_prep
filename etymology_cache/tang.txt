tang (n.)

mid-14c., serpent's tongue (thought to be a stinging organ), later sharp extension of a metal blade
(1680s), from a Scandinavian source akin to Old Norse tangi spit of land; pointed end by which a
blade is driven into a handle, from Proto-Germanic *tang-, from PIE *denk- to bite (see tongs).
Influenced in some senses by tongue (n.). Figurative sense of a sharp taste is first recorded mid-
15c.; that of suggestion, trace is from 1590s. The fish (1734) so called for their spines.
