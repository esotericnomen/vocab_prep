early 15c., deciding by one's own discretion, from Old French arbitraire (14c.) or directly from
Latin arbitrarius depending on the will, uncertain, from arbiter (see <a
href=/index.php?term=arbiter&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>arbiter</a>). The original
meaning gradually descended to capricious and despotic (1640s). Related: Arbitrarily; arbitrariness.
