labor, toil, mid-13c., from Old French travail work, labor, toil, suffering or painful effort,
trouble; arduous journey (12c.), from travailler to toil, labor, originally to trouble, torture,
torment, from Vulgar Latin *tripaliare to torture, from *tripalium (in Late Latin trepalium)
instrument of torture, probably from Latin tripalis having three stakes (from tria three; see <a

<a href=/index.php?term=pale&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>pale</a> (n.)), which
sounds ominous, but the exact notion is obscure. The verb is recorded from late 13c. in English,
from the verb in Old French.
