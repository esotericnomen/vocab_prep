travail (n.)

labor, toil, mid-13c., from Old French travail work, labor, toil, suffering or painful effort,
trouble; arduous journey (12c.), from travailler to toil, labor, originally to trouble, torture,
torment, from Vulgar Latin *tripaliare to torture, from *tripalium (in Late Latin trepalium)
instrument of torture, probably from Latin tripalis having three stakes (from tria three; see three
+ palus stake; see pale (n.)), which sounds ominous, but the exact notion is obscure. The verb is
recorded from late 13c. in English, from the verb in Old French.
