1520s, from Latin promulgatus, past participle of promulgare make publicly known, propose openly,
publish, perhaps altered from provulgare, from pro- forth (see <a
href=/index.php?term=pro-&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>pro-</a>) + vulgare make
public, publish. Or the second element might be from mulgere to milk (see <a
href=/index.php?term=milk&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>milk</a> (n.)), used
metaphorically for cause to emerge. Related: Promulgated; promulgating. The earlier verb in English
was promulge (late 15c.).
