1550s, trim, neat, spruce, smart, possibly an alteration of Low German smuk trim, neat, from Middle
Low German sm&uuml;cken to adorn (originally to dress, secondary sense of words meaning to creep or
slip into), from the same source as <a href=/index.php?term=smock&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>smock</a>. The meaning having a self-satisfied air is from 1701, an extension
of the sense of smooth, sleek (1580s), which was commonly used of attractive women and girls.
