Old English swerian take an oath (class VI strong verb; past tense swor, past participle sworen),
from Proto-Germanic *swarjan-, (cognates: Old Saxon swerian, Old Frisian swera, Old Norse sverja,
Danish sverge, Middle Dutch swaren, Old High German swerien, German schw&ouml;ren, Gothic swaren to
swear), from PIE root *swer- (1) to speak, talk, say (cognates: Old Church Slavonic svara quarrel,
Oscan sverrunei to the speaker).  <br /><br />  Also related to the second element in <a

sense of use bad language (early 15c.) developed from the notion of invoke sacred names. Swear off
desist as with a vow is from 1898. Swear in install in office by administration of an oath is from
1700 in modern use, echoing Old English.
