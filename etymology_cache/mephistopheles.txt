Mephistopheles

1590s, the evil spirit to whom Faust sold his soul in the German legend, from German (1587), of
unknown origin. According to the speculation of eminent G&ouml;the scholar K.J. Schr&ouml;er (1886)
it is a compound of Hebrew mephitz destroyer + tophel liar (short for tophel sheqer, literally
falsehood plasterer; see Job xiii:4). Klein writes that the names of devils in the Middle Ages are
in most cases derived from Hebrew.
