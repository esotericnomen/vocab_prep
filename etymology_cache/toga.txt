toga (n.)

c.1600, from Latin toga cloak or mantle, from PIE *tog-a- covering, from root *(s)teg- to cover (see
stegosaurus). The outer garment of a Roman citizen in time of peace.  <blockquote>  The toga as the
Roman national dress was allowed to be worn by free citizens only. A stranger not in full possession
of the rights of a Roman citizen could not venture to appear in it. Even banished Romans were in
imperial times precluded from wearing it. The appearance in public in a foreign dress was considered
as contempt of the majesty of the Roman people. Even boys appeared in the toga, called, owing to the
purple edge attached to it (a custom adopted from the Etruscans) toga praetexta. On completing his
sixteenth, afterward his fifteenth, year (tirocinium fori), the boy exchanged the toga praetexta for
the toga virilis, pura, or libera--a white cloak without the purple edge. Roman ladies (for these
also wore the toga) abandoned the purple edge on being married. [Guhl &amp; Koner, The Life of the
Greeks and Romans, transl. Francis Hueffer, 1876]  </blockquote>  Breeches, like the word for them
(Latin bracae) were alien to the Romans, being the dress of Persians, Germans, and Gauls, so that
bracatus wearing breeches was a term in Roman geography meaning north of the Alps. College
fraternity toga party was re-popularized by movie Animal House (1978), but this is set in 1962 and
the custom seems to date from at least the mid-1950s.  <blockquote>  Down on Prospect Street, Campus
Club held a toga party, at which everyone wore togas. Charter held a come-as-you-are party, at which
everyone wore what they happened to have on, and Cloister held a party called A Night in Tahiti, at
which we'd hate to guess what everyone wore. The borough police reported that only one false alarm
was turned in. [Princeton Alumni Weekly, March 19, 1954]  </blockquote>
