livid (adj.)

early 15c., of a bluish-leaden color, from Middle French livide and directly from Latin lividus of a
bluish color, black and blue, figuratively envious, spiteful, malicious, from livere be bluish,
earlier *slivere, from PIE *sliwo-, suffixed form of root *(s)leie- bluish (cognates: Old Church
Slavonic and Russian sliva plum; Lithuanian slywas plum; Old Irish li, Welsh lliw color, splendor,
Old English sla sloe). The sense of furiously angry (1912) is from the notion of being livid with
rage.
