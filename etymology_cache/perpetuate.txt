perpetuate (v.)

1520s, a back-formation from perpetuation or else from Latin perpetuatus, past participle of
perpetuare to make perpetual, from perpetuus (see perpetual). Related: Perpetuated; Perpetuating.


perpetuation (n.)

late 14c., from Medieval Latin perpetuationem (nominative perpetuatio), noun of action from past
participle stem of perpetuare (see perpetuate).


ale (n.)

Old English ealu ale, beer, from Proto-Germanic *aluth- (cognates: Old Saxon alo, Old Norse
&ouml;l), perhaps from PIE root meaning bitter (cognates: Latin alumen alum), or from PIE *alu-t
ale, from root *alu-, which has connotations of sorcery, magic, possession, intoxication. The word
was borrowed from Germanic into Lithuanian (alus) and Old Church Slavonic (olu).  In the fifteenth
century, and until the seventeenth, ale stood for the unhopped fermented malt liquor which had long
been the native drink of these islands. Beer was the hopped malt liquor introduced from the Low
Countires in the fifteenth century and popular first of all in the towns. By the eighteenth century,
however, all malt liquor was hopped and there had been a silent mutation in the meaning of the two
terms. For a time the terms became synonymous, in fact, but local habits of nomenclature still
continued to perpetuate what had been a real difference: 'beer' was the malt liquor which tended to
be found in towns, 'ale' was the term in general use in the country districts. [Peter Mathias, The
Brewing Industry in England, Cambridge University Press, 1959]Meaning festival or merry-meeting at
which much ale was drunk was in Old English (see bridal).
