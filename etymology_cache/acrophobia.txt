morbid fear of heights, 1887, medical Latin, from Greek akros at the end, the top (see <a
href=/index.php?term=acrid&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>acrid</a>) + <a
href=/index.php?term=-phobia&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>-phobia</a> fear. Coined by
Italian physician Dr. Andrea Verga in a paper describing the condition, from which Verga himself
suffered.  <blockquote>  In this paper, read somewhat over a year ago at the congress of alienists
at Pavia, the author makes confession of his own extreme dread of high places. Though fearless of
the contagion of cholera, he has palpitations on mounting a step-ladder, finds it unpleasant to ride
on the top of a coach or to look out of even a first-story window, and has never used an elevator.
[American Journal of Psychology, Nov. 1888, abstract of Verga's report]  </blockquote>
