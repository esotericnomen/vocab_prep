barefaced (adj.)

1580s, with face uncovered or shaven; see bare (adj.) + face (n.). Thus, unconcealed (c.1600), and,
in a bad sense, shameless (1670s). Compare effrontery. The half-French bare-vis (adj.) conveyed the
same sense in Middle English.


effrontery (n.)

1715, from French effronterie, from effront&eacute; shameless, from Old French esfronte shameless,
brazen, probably from Late Latin effrontem (nominative effrons) barefaced, from Latin ex- out (see
ex-) + frontem (nominative frons) brow (see front (n.)).    Latin frontus had a sense of ability to
blush, but the literal sense of effrontery often has been taken to be putting forth the forehead.
Forehead in Johnson's Dictionary (1755) has a secondary sense of impudence; confidence; assurance;
audaciousness; audacity.
