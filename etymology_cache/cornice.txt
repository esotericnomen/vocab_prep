cornice (n.)

1560s, from Middle French corniche (16c.) or directly from Italian cornice ornamental molding along
a wall, perhaps from Latin coronis curved line, flourish in writing, from Greek koronis curved
object (see crown). Perhaps influenced by (or even from) Latin cornicem, accusative of cornix crow
(compare corbel).
