1560s, from Middle French corniche (16c.) or directly from Italian cornice ornamental molding along
a wall, perhaps from Latin coronis curved line, flourish in writing, from Greek koronis curved
object (see <a href=/index.php?term=crown&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>crown</a>).
Perhaps influenced by (or even from) Latin cornicem, accusative of cornix crow (compare <a
