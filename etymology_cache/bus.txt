bus (n.)

1832, abbreviation of omnibus (q.v.). The modern English noun is nothing but a Latin dative plural
ending. To miss the bus, in the figurative sense of lose an opportunity, is from 1901, Australian
English (OED has a figurative miss the omnibus from 1886). Busman's holiday leisure time spent doing
what one does for a living (1893) is probably a reference to London bus drivers riding the buses on
their days off.
