ratiocination (n.)

process of reasoning, 1520s, from Latin ratiocinationem (nominative ratiocinatio) a reasoning, calm
reasoning, from past participle stem of ratiocinare to calculate, deliberate, from ratio (see ratio)
+ -cinari, which probably is related to conari to try (see conation).  <blockquote>  Most writers
make ratiocination synonymous with reasoning. J.S. Mill and others hold that the word is usually
limited to necessary reasoning. [Century Dictionary]  </blockquote>
