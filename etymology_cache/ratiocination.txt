process of reasoning, 1520s, from Latin ratiocinationem (nominative ratiocinatio) a reasoning, calm
reasoning, from past participle stem of ratiocinare to calculate, deliberate, from ratio (see <a
href=/index.php?term=ratio&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>ratio</a>) + -cinari, which
probably is related to conari to try (see <a href=/index.php?term=conation&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>conation</a>).  <blockquote>  Most writers make ratiocination synonymous with
reasoning. J.S. Mill and others hold that the word is usually limited to necessary reasoning.
