process of reasoning, 1520s, from Latin ratiocinationem (nominative ratiocinatio) a reasoning, calm
reasoning, from past participle stem of ratiocinare to calculate, deliberate, from ratio (see ratio)
+ -cinari, which probably is related to conari to try (see conation).    Most writers make
ratiocination synonymous with reasoning. J.S. Mill and others hold that the word is usually limited
to necessary reasoning. [Century Dictionary]
