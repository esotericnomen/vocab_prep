trickster (n.)

grifter (n.)

confidence trickster, 1906, carnival and circus slang, probably an alteration of grafter (see graft
(n.2); also compare grift). Gradually extended to any non-violent criminal.


treacherous (adj.)

early 14c., from Old French trecheros, tricheros deceitful (12c.), from trecheor, tricheor cheat,
deceiver, liar, impostor, trickster, agent noun from trechier, trichier to cheat, trick (see trick
(n.)). Figuratively, of things, from c.1600. Related: Treacherously; treacherousness. Middle English
had treacher deceiver, cheat, traitor.


fob (v.)

to cheat, late 14c., from obsolete noun fobbe cheat, trickster (late 14c.), perhaps from Old French
forbe cheat [OED]. Alternative etymology holds that the word is perhaps related to German foppen to
jeer at, make a fool of (see fop); or from German fuppen, einfuppen to pocket stealthily, which
would connect it to fob (n.). To fob (someone) off is first recorded 1590s. Related: Fobbed;
fobbing.
