1825, strike with a sweeping motion, from swipe (n.). The slang sense of steal, pilfer appeared
1885, American English; earliest use in prison jargon:    The blokes in the next cell, little
Charley Ames and the Sheeney Kid, they was hot to try it, and swiped enough shoe-lining out of shop
No. 5, where they worked, to make us all breeches to the stripes. [Lippincott's Magazine, vol. 35,
June 1885]    Meaning run a credit card is 1990s. Related: Swiped; swiper; swiping.


swipe (n.)

1807, a driving stroke made with the arms in full swing, perhaps a dialectal variant of sweep (n.),
or in part from obsolete swip a stroke, blow (c.1200), from Proto-Germanic *swip-, related to Old
English swipu a stick, whip; chastisement. Other possible sources or influences are Middle English
swope to sweep with broad movements (in reference to brooms, swords, etc.), from Old English swapan;
obsolete swaip stroke, blow; or obsolete swape oar, pole.


side-swipe (v.)

also sideswipe, to strike with a glancing blow, 1904, from side (adj.) + swipe (v.). Related: Side-
swiped; side-swiping. The noun is first recorded 1917.


whip (v.)

mid-13c., wippen flap violently, not in Old English, of uncertain origin, ultimately from Proto-
Germanic *wipjan to move back and forth (cognates: Danish vippe to raise with a swipe, Middle Dutch,
Dutch wippen to swing, Old High German wipf swing, impetus), from PIE *weip- to turn, vacillate,
tremble (see vibrate). The senses of both [noun and verb] no doubt represent several independent
adoptions or formations [OED]. The cookery sense is from 1670s. Related: Whipped; whipping. Whip
snake first recorded 1774, so called for its shape.
