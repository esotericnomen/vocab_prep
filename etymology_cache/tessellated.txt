1690s, from Late Latin tessellatus made of small square stones or tiles, past participle of
tesselare, from tessella small square stone or tile, diminutive of tessera a cube or square of stone
or wood, perhaps from Greek tessera, neuter of tesseres, Ionic variant of tessares four (see <a
href=/index.php?term=four&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>four</a>), in reference to
four corners. Related: Tessellate (v.), a 1791 back-formation (from 1826 as an adjective, 1909 as a
noun); tessellating.
