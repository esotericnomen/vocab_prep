late 15c., glutton, from Middle French gourmant glutton, originally an adj., gluttonous, of
uncertain origin. Not connected with gourmet. Meaning one fond of good eating is from 1758.
<blockquote>  The gourmand is one whose chief pleasure is eating; but a gourmet is a connoisseur of
food and wines. In England the difference is this: a gourmand regards quantity more than quality, a
gourmet quality more than quantity. [Brewer, Dictionary of Phrase and Fable, Philadelphia, 1898]
