gourmand (n.)

late 15c., glutton, from Middle French gourmant glutton, originally an adj., gluttonous, of
uncertain origin. Not connected with gourmet. Meaning one fond of good eating is from 1758.    The
gourmand is one whose chief pleasure is eating; but a gourmet is a connoisseur of food and wines. In
England the difference is this: a gourmand regards quantity more than quality, a gourmet quality
more than quantity. [Brewer, Dictionary of Phrase and Fable, Philadelphia, 1898]
