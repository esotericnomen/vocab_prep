decadent (adj.)

in a state of decline or decay (from a former condition of excellence), 1837, from French
d&eacute;cadent, back-formation from d&eacute;cadence (see decadence). In reference to literary
(later, other artistic) schools that believed, or affected to believe, they lived in an age of
artistic decadence, 1885 in French, 1888 in English. Usually in a bad sense:    Bread, supposedly
the staff of life, has become one of our most decadent foods -- doughy, gummy, and without the
aroma, flavor, texture, taste and appearance that is typical of good bread. [College and University
Business 1960]    Beckoning sense of desirable and satisfying to self-indulgence begins c.1970 in
commercial publications in reference to desserts.


effete (adj.)

1620s, from Latin effetus (usually in fem. effeta) exhausted, unproductive, worn out (with bearing
offspring), past bearing, literally that has given birth, from a lost verb, *efferi, from ex- out
(see ex-) + fetus childbearing, offspring (see fetus). Figurative use is earliest in English;
literal use is rare. Sense of exhausted is 1660s; that of intellectually or morally exhausted (1790)
led to decadent (19c.).


vest (n.)

1610s, loose outer garment (worn by men in Eastern countries or in ancient times), from French veste
a vest, jacket (17c.), from Italian vesta, veste robe, gown, from Latin vestis clothing, from
vestire to clothe (see vest (v.)). The sleeveless garment worn by men beneath the coat was
introduced by Charles II in a bid to rein in men's attire at court, which had grown extravagant and
decadent in the French mode.    The King hath yesterday, in Council, declared his resolution of
setting a fashion for clothes .... It will be a vest, I know not well how; but it is to teach the
nobility thrift. [Pepys, Diary, Oct. 8, 1666]    Louis XIV of France is said to have mocked the
effort by putting his footmen in such vests.
