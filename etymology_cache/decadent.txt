in a state of decline or decay (from a former condition of excellence), 1837, from French
d&eacute;cadent, back-formation from d&eacute;cadence (see <a
href=/index.php?term=decadence&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>decadence</a>). In
reference to literary (later, other artistic) schools that believed, or affected to believe, they
lived in an age of artistic decadence, 1885 in French, 1888 in English. Usually in a bad sense:
<blockquote>  Bread, supposedly the staff of life, has become one of our most decadent foods --
doughy, gummy, and without the aroma, flavor, texture, taste and appearance that is typical of good
bread. [College and University Business 1960]  </blockquote>  Beckoning sense of desirable and
satisfying to self-indulgence begins c.1970 in commercial publications in reference to desserts.
