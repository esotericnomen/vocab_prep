late 14c., from Anglo-French legaunce loyalty of a liege-man to his lord, from Old French legeance,
from liege (see <a href=/index.php?term=liege&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>liege</a>); erroneously associated with Latin ligare to bind; corrupted in
spelling by confusion with the now-obsolete legal term allegeance alleviation. General figurative
sense of recognition of claims to respect or duty is attested from 1732.
