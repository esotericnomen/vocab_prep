allegiance (n.)

late 14c., from Anglo-French legaunce loyalty of a liege-man to his lord, from Old French legeance,
from liege (see liege); erroneously associated with Latin ligare to bind; corrupted in spelling by
confusion with the now-obsolete legal term allegeance alleviation. General figurative sense of
recognition of claims to respect or duty is attested from 1732.
