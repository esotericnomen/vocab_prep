pulchritude (n.)

beauty, c.1400, from Latin pulchritudo beauty; excellence, attractiveness, from pulcher beautiful,
of unknown origin.


beefcake (n.)

by 1952, display of male pulchritude in movies or magazines; said to have been modeled on
cheesecake, but there seems to have been an actual foodstuff called beefcake around this time. The
word seems to be little used in that literal sense since the other sense emerged.


pulchritudinous (adj.)

1877, American English, from pulchritude (from Latin pulchritudino beauty, genitive pulchritudinis)
+ -ous.


lachrymose (adj.)

1660s, tear-like, from Latin lacrimosus tearful, sorrowful, weeping, also causing tears, lamentable,
from lacrima tear, a dialect-altered borrowing of Greek dakryma tear, from dakryein to shed tears,
from dakry tear, from PIE *dakru- (see tear (n.1)). Meaning given to tears, tearful is first
attested 1727; meaning of a mournful character is from 1822.    The -d- to -l- alteration in Latin
is the so-called Sabine -L-; compare Latin olere smell, from root of odor, and Ulixes, the Latin
form of Greek Odysseus. The Medieval Latin practice of writing -ch- for -c- before Latin -r- also
altered anchor, pulchritude, sepulchre. The -y- is pedantic, from belief in a Greek origin. Middle
English had lacrymable tearful (mid-15c.).
