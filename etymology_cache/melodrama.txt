melodrama (n.)

1784 (1782 as melo drame), a stage-play in which songs were interspersed and music accompanied the
action, from French m&eacute;lodrame (18c.), from Greek melos song (see melody) + French drame drama
(see drama). Meaning a romantic and sensational dramatic piece with a happy ending is from 1883,
because this was often the form of the original melodramas. Also from French are Spanish melodrama,
Italian melodramma, German melodram. Related: Melodramatize.
