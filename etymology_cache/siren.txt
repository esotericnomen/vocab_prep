mid-14c., sea nymph who by her singing lures sailors to their destruction, from Old French sereine
(12c., Modern French sir&#232;ne) and directly from Latin Siren (Late Latin Sirena), from Greek
Seiren [Odyssey, xii.39 ff.], one of the Seirenes, mythical sisters who enticed sailors to their
deaths with their songs, also in Greek a deceitful woman, perhaps literally binder, entangler, from
seira cord, rope.  <br /><br />  Meaning device that makes a warning sound (on an ambulance, etc.)
first recorded 1879, in reference to steamboats, perhaps from similar use of the French word.
Figurative sense of one who sings sweetly and charms is recorded from 1580s. The classical
descriptions of them were mangled in medieval translations and glosses, resulting in odd notions of
what they looked like.
