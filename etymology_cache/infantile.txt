oral (adj.)

1620s, from Late Latin oralis, from Latin os (genitive oris) mouth, opening, face, entrance, from
PIE *os- mouth (cognates: Sanskrit asan mouth, asyam mouth, opening, Avestan ah-, Hittite aish,
Middle Irish a mouth, Old Norse oss mouth of a river, Old English or beginning, origin, front).
Psychological meaning of the mouth as the focus of infantile sexual energy (as in oral fixation) is
from 1910. The sexual sense is first recorded 1948, in Kinsey. As a noun, oral examination, attested
from 1876. Related: Orally (c.1600); orality.


poliomyelitis (n.)

1874, also polio-myelitis, coined by German physician Adolph Kussmaul (1822-1902) from Greek polios
grey (see fallow (adj.)) + myelos marrow + -itis inflammation. So called because the gray matter in
the spinal cord is inflamed, which causes paralysis. The earlier name was infantile paralysis
(1843).    In many respects, also, this affection resembles the acute spinal paralysis of infancy,
which, from the researches of Charcot, Joffroy, and others, have been shown pathologically to be an
acute myelitis of the anterior cornua. Hence, for these forms of paralysis, Professor Kussmaul
suggests the name of 'poliomyelitis anterior.' [London Medical Record, Dec. 9, 1874]
