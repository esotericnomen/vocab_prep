precarious (adj.)

1640s, a legal word, held through the favor of another, from Latin precarius obtained by asking or
praying, from prex (genitive precis) entreaty, prayer (see pray). Notion of dependent on the will of
another led to extended sense risky, dangerous, uncertain (1680s). No word is more unskillfully used
than this with its derivatives. It is used for uncertain in all its senses; but it only means
uncertain, as dependent on others ... [Johnson]. Related: Precariously; precariousness.
