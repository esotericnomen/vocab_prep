1640s, a legal word, held through the favor of another, from Latin precarius obtained by asking or
praying, from prex (genitive precis) entreaty, prayer (see <a
href=/index.php?term=pray&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>pray</a>). Notion of dependent
on the will of another led to extended sense risky, dangerous, uncertain (1680s). No word is more
unskillfully used than this with its derivatives. It is used for uncertain in all its senses; but it
only means uncertain, as dependent on others ... [Johnson]. Related: Precariously; precariousness.
