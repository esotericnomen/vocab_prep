plasticity

1782, from plastic + -ity.


multiverse (n.)

1895, William James's coinage, an alternative to universe meant to convey absence of order and
unity.    But those times are past; and we of the nineteenth century, with our evolutionary theories
and our mechanical philosophies, already know nature too impartially and too well to worship
unreservedly any god of whose character she can be an adequate expression. Truly all we know of good
and beauty proceeds from nature, but none the less so all we know of evil. Visible nature is all
plasticity and indifference, a moral multiverse, as one might call it, and not a moral universe.
[William James, Is Life Worth Living? address to the Young Men's Christian Association of Harvard
University, May 1895]
