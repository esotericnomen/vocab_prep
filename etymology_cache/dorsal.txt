dorsal (adj.)

early 15c., from Old French dorsal (14c.) or directly from Medieval Latin dorsalis, corresponding to
Latin dorsualis of the back, from dorsum back, of uncertain origin.


distal (adj.)

dossier (n.)

1880, from French dossier bundle of papers, from dos back (12c.), from Vulgar Latin dossum, variant
of Latin dorsum back (see dorsal). Supposedly so called because the bundle bore a label on the back,
or possibly from resemblance of the bulge in a mass of bundled papers to the curve of a back. Old
French dossiere meant back-strap, ridge strap (of a horse's harness).


bass (n.)

freshwater fish, early 15c. corruption of Old English b&aelig;rs a fish, perch, from Proto-Germanic
base *bars- sharp (cognates: Middle Dutch baerse, Middle High German bars, German Barsch perch,
German barsch rough), from PIE root *bhar- point, bristle (see bristle (n.)). The fish was so called
for its dorsal fins. For loss of -r-, see ass (n.2).
