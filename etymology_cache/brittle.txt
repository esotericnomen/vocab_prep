brittle (adj.)

late 14c., britel, perhaps from an unrecorded Old English adjective *brytel, related to brytan to
crush, pound, to break to pieces, from Proto-Germanic stem *brutila- brittle, from *breutan to break
up (cognates: Old Norse brjota to break, Old High German brodi fragile), from PIE *bhreu- to cut,
break up (see bruise (v.)). With -le, suffix forming adjectives with meaning liable to.
