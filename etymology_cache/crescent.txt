crescent (n.)

late 14c., crescent-shaped ornament, from Anglo-French cressaunt, from Old French creissant crescent
of the moon (12c., Modern French croissant), from Latin crescentum (nominative crescens), present
participle of crescere come forth, spring up, grow, thrive, swell, increase in numbers or strength,
from PIE root *ker- (3) to grow (cognates: Latin Ceres, goddess of agriculture, creare to bring
forth, create, produce; Greek kouros boy, kore girl; Armenian serem bring forth, serim be born).
Applied in Latin to the waxing moon, luna crescens, but subsequently in Latin mistaken to refer to
the shape, not the stage. The original Latin sense is preserved in crescendo. A badge or emblem of
the Turkish sultans (probably chosen for its suggestion of increase); figurative sense of Muslim
political power is from 1580s, but modern writers often falsely associate it with the Saracens of
the Crusades or the Moors of Spain. Horns of the waxing moon are on the viewer's left side; those of
the waning moon are on his right.
