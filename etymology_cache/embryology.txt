embryology (n.)

1859, from embryon (see embryo) + -logy. Related: Embryologist (c.1850).


proton (n.)

1920 in physics, coined by English physicist Ernest Rutherford (1871-1937) from noun use of Greek
proton, neuter of protos first (see proto-), on analogy of electron; supposedly because hydrogen was
hypothesized as a constituent of all the elements. The word was used earlier in embryology (1893) as
a translation of German anlage (fundamental thing) based on Aristotle's phrase he prote ousia to
proton.
