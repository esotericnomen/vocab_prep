sojourn (n.)

mid-13c., temporary stay, visit, from Anglo-French sojorn, variant of Old French sejorn, from
sejorner stay or dwell for a time (see sojourn (v.)).


sojourner (n.)

temporary resident, 15c., agent noun from sojourn (v.).


sojourn (v.)

late 13c., stay temporarily, reside for a time; visit; also reside permanently, dwell; from Old
French sojorner stay or dwell for a time, from Vulgar Latin *subdiurnare to spend the day (source
also of Italian soggiornare), from Latin sub- under, until (see sub-) + diurnare to last long, from
diurnus of a day, from diurnum day (see diurnal). Modern French s&eacute;journer formed via vowel
dissimilation. Related: Sojourned; sojourning.


peregrination (n.)

early 15c., from Old French peregrination pilgrimage, long absence (12c.) or directly from Latin
peregrinationem (nominative peregrinatio) a journey, a sojourn abroad, noun of action from past
participle stem of peregrinari to journey or travel abroad, figuratively to roam about, wander, from
peregrinus from foreign parts, foreigner, from peregre (adv.) abroad, properly from abroad, found
outside Roman territory, from per- (see per) + agri, locative of ager field, territory, land,
country (see acre).


wretch (n.)

Old English wrecca wretch, stranger, exile, from Proto-Germanic *wrakjon pursuer; one pursued
(cognates: Old Saxon wrekkio, Old High German reckeo a banished person, exile, German recke renowned
warrior, hero), related to Old English wreccan to drive out, punish (see wreak). The contrast in the
development of the meaning in Eng. and German is remarkable [OED]. Sense of vile, despicable person
developed in Old English, reflecting the sorry state of the outcast, as presented in Anglo-Saxon
verse (such as The Wanderer). Compare German Elend misery, from Old High German elilenti sojourn in
a foreign land, exile.
