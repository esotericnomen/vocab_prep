late 14c., unconnected, unrelated, not to the point, from Old French impertinent (14c.) or directly
from Late Latin impertinentem (nominative impertinens) not belonging, literally not to the point,
from assimilated form of Latin in- not, opposite of (see <a
href=/index.php?term=in-&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>in-</a> (1)) + pertinens (see
<a href=/index.php?term=pertinent&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>pertinent</a>). Sense
of rudely bold is 1680s, from earlier sense of not appropriate to the situation, probably modeled on
similar use in French, especially by Moli&egrave;re, from notion of meddling with what is beyond
one's proper sphere.
