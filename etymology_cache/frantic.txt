frantic (adj.)

mid-14c., insane, unexplained variant of Middle English frentik (see frenetic). Transferred meaning
affected by wild excitement is from late 15c. Of the adverbial forms, frantically (1749) is later
than franticly (1540s).


brainy (adj.)

1845, from brain (n.) + -y (2). Latin equivalent cerebrosus meant passionate, hot-headed, leading
Tucker to remark that  'Brainy' is not a natural expression for 'frantic.'


bedevil (v.)

1768, to treat diabolically, abuse, from be- + verbal use of devil (q.v.). Meaning to mischievously
confuse is from 1755; that of to drive frantic is from 1823. Related: Bedeviled (1570s, in a literal
sense, possessed); bedeviling.


phrenetic (adj.)

late 14c., from Old French frenetike mad, crazy (13c.), from Latin phreneticus, from Greek phren
diaphragm, heart, mind (see phreno-). A doublet of frantic.
