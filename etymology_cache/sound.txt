sound (n.1)

noise, what is heard, sensation produced through the ear, late 13c., soun, from Old French son
sound, musical note, voice, from Latin sonus sound, a noise, from PIE *swon-o-, from root *swen- to
sound (cognates: Sanskrit svanati it sounds, svanah sound, tone; Latin sonare to sound; Old Irish
senim the playing of an instrument; Old English geswin music, song, swinsian to sing; Old Norse
svanr, Old English swan swan, properly the sounding bird).    The terminal -d was established
c.1350-1550 as part of a tendency to add -d- after -n-. First record of sound barrier is from 1939.
Sound check is from 1977; sound effects is 1909, originally live accompaniments to silent films.
