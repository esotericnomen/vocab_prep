Achilles tendon

from Modern Latin tendo Achillis, first used by German surgeon Heister and so-called in reference to
the one vulnerable spot of the great Greek hero Achilles, whose mother held him by the heel when she
dipped him in the River Styx to render him invulnerable (though this story is not in Homer and not
found before 1c. C.E.). Earlier Achilles' sinew, from Modern Latin chorda Achillis, coined 1693 by
Dutch anatomist Philip Verheyden when dissecting his own amputated leg. Hence figurative use of heel
of Achillies for vulnerable spot (1810).
