early 15c., from Middle French compulsion, from Latin compulsionem (nominative compulsio) a driving,
urging, noun of action from past participle stem of compellere compel (see <a
href=/index.php?term=compel&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>compel</a>). Psychological
sense is from 1909 in A.A. Brill's translation of Freud's Selected Papers on Hysteria, where German
Zwangsneurose is rendered as compulsion neurosis.
