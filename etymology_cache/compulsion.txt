compulsion (n.)

early 15c., from Middle French compulsion, from Latin compulsionem (nominative compulsio) a driving,
urging, noun of action from past participle stem of compellere compel (see compel). Psychological
sense is from 1909 in A.A. Brill's translation of Freud's Selected Papers on Hysteria, where German
Zwangsneurose is rendered as compulsion neurosis.
