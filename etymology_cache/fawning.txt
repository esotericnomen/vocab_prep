adulation (n.)

late 14c., insincere praise, from Old French adulacion, from Latin adulationem (nominative adulatio)
a fawning; flattery, cringing courtesy, noun of action from past participle stem of aduliari to
flatter, from ad- to (see ad-) + ulos tail, from PIE *ul- the tail (cognates: Sanskrit valah tail,
