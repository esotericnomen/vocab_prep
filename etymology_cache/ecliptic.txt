late 14c., the circle in the sky followed by the Sun, from Medieval Latin ecliptica, from Late Latin
(linea) ecliptica, from Greek ekliptikos of an eclipse (see <a
href=/index.php?term=eclipse&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>eclipse</a> (n.)). So
called because eclipses happen only when the Moon is near the line. Related: Ecliptical.
