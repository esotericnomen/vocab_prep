aesthetic (n.)

1798, from German &Auml;sthetisch or French esth&eacute;tique, both from Greek aisthetikos
sensitive, perceptive, from aisthanesthai to perceive (by the senses or by the mind), to feel, from
PIE *awis-dh-yo-, from root *au- to perceive (see audience).  Popularized in English by translation
of Immanuel Kant, and used originally in the classically correct sense the science which treats of
the conditions of sensuous perception. Kant had tried to correct the term after Alexander Baumgarten
had taken it in German to mean criticism of taste (1750s), but Baumgarten's sense attained
popularity in English c.1830s (despite scholarly resistance) and removed the word from any
philosophical base. Walter Pater used it (1868) to describe the late 19c. movement that advocated
art for art's sake, which further blurred the sense. As an adjective by 1803. Related:
Aesthetically.
