contagion (n.)

late 14c., from Old French contagion, from Latin contagionem (nominative contagio) a touching,
contact, contagion, related to contingere touch closely (see contact (n.)).


infection (n.)

late 14c., infectious disease; contaminated condition; from Old French infeccion contamination,
poisoning (13c.) and directly from Late Latin infectionem (nominative infectio), noun of action from
past participle stem of Latin inficere (see infect). Meaning communication of disease by agency of
air or water (distinguished from contagion, which is body-to-body communication), is from 1540s.


acrophobia (n.)

morbid fear of heights, 1887, medical Latin, from Greek akros at the end, the top (see acrid) +
-phobia fear. Coined by Italian physician Dr. Andrea Verga in a paper describing the condition, from
which Verga himself suffered.    In this paper, read somewhat over a year ago at the congress of
alienists at Pavia, the author makes confession of his own extreme dread of high places. Though
fearless of the contagion of cholera, he has palpitations on mounting a step-ladder, finds it
unpleasant to ride on the top of a coach or to look out of even a first-story window, and has never
used an elevator. [American Journal of Psychology, Nov. 1888, abstract of Verga's report]
