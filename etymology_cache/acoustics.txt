etc., attested from 1885.


resonance (n.)

mid-15c., in acoustics, prolongation of sound by reverberation; 1660s, act of resonating; from
Middle French resonance (15c.), from Latin resonantia echo, from resonare to sound again (see

-ics

in the names of sciences or disciplines (acoustics, aerobics, economics, etc.) it represents a 16c.
revival of the classical custom of using the neuter plural of adjectives with -ikos (see -ic) to
mean matters relevant to and also as the titles of treatises about them. Subject matters that
acquired their names in English before c.1500, however, tend to remain in singular (such as
arithmetic, logic).
