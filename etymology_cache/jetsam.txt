jetsam (n.)

1560s, jottsome act of throwing goods overboard to lighten a ship, alteration and contraction of
Middle English jetteson, from Anglo-French getteson, Old French getaison a throwing (see jettison).
Intermediate forms were jetson, jetsome; the form perhaps was deformed by influence of flotsam. From
1590s as goods thrown overboard; figurative use by 1861. For distinction of meaning, see flotsam.
