pending (prep.)

1640s, during, in the process of, preposition formed from root of French pendant during, literally
hanging, present participle of pendere to hang, to suspend (see pendant). Meaning patterned on a
secondary sense of Latin pendente not decided, literally hanging, in legal phrase pendente lite
while the suit is pending. Use of the present participle before nouns caused it to be regarded as a
preposition. As an adjective from 1797.
