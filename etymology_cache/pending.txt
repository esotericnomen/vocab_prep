1640s, during, in the process of, preposition formed from root of French pendant during, literally
hanging, present participle of pendere to hang, to suspend (see <a
href=/index.php?term=pendant&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>pendant</a>). Meaning
patterned on a secondary sense of Latin pendente not decided, literally hanging, in legal phrase
pendente lite while the suit is pending. Use of the present participle before nouns caused it to be
regarded as a preposition. As an adjective from 1797.
