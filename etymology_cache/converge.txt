converge (v.)

1690s, from Late Latin convergere to incline together from com- together (see com-) + vergere to
bend (see verge (v.)). Related: Converged; converging.


-ance

word-forming element attached to verbs to form abstract nouns of process or fact (convergence from
converge), or of state or quality (absence from absent); ultimately from Latin -antia and -entia,
which depended on the vowel in the stem word.    As Old French evolved from Latin, these were
leveled to -ance, but later French borrowings from Latin (some of them subsequently passed to
English) used the appropriate Latin form of the ending, as did words borrowed by English directly
from Latin (diligence, absence).    English thus inherited a confused mass of words from French and
further confused it since c.1500 by restoring -ence selectively in some forms of these words to
conform with Latin. Thus dependant, but independence, etc.
