from Latin apprehensus, past participle of apprehendere (see apprehend). Meaning fearful of what is

Americanism (n.)

1781, in reference to words or phrases distinct from British use, coined by John Witherspoon
(1723-1794), president of Princeton College, from American + -ism. (American English English
language as spoken in the United States is first recorded 1806, in Webster.) Americanism in the
patriotic sense attachment to the U.S. is attested from 1797, first found in the writings of Thomas
Jefferson.    I have been not a little disappointed, and made suspicious of my own judgment, on
seeing the Edinburgh Reviews, the ablest critics of the age, set their faces against the
introduction of new words into the English language; they are particularly apprehensive that the
writers of the United States will adulterate it. Certainly so great growing a population, spread
over such an extent of country, with such a variety of climates, of productions, of arts, must
enlarge their language, to make it answer its purpose of expressing all ideas, the new as well as
the old. [Jefferson to John Waldo, Aug. 16, 1813]
