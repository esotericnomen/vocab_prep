dictum (n.)

1660s, from Latin dictum thing said (a saying, bon-mot, prophecy, etc.), an order, command, neuter
of dictus, past participle of dicere say (see diction). In legal use, a judge's expression of
opinion which is not the formal resolution of a case.

statement in passing, a judge's expression of opinion not regarded as binding or decisive, Latin,
literally something said incidentally; see obiter + dictum.


glasnost (n.)

1972 (in reference to a letter of 1969 by Solzhenitsyn), from Russian glasnost openness to public
scrutiny, literally publicity, fact of being public, ultimately from Old Church Slavonic glasu
voice, from PIE *gal-so-, from root *gal- (2) to call, shout (see call (v.)). First used in a socio-
political sense by Lenin; popularized in English after Mikhail Gorbachev used it prominently in a
speech of March 11, 1985, accepting the post of general secretary of the CPSU.    The Soviets, it
seems, have rediscovered the value of Lenin's dictum that glasnost, the Russian word for openness or
publicity, is a desirable form of conduct. [New York Times news service article, March 1981]
