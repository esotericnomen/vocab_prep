late 14c., something formed in the mind, thought, notion, from conceiven (see <a
href=/index.php?term=conceive&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>conceive</a>) based on
analogy of deceit and receipt. Sense evolved from something formed in the mind, to fanciful or witty
notion (1510s), to vanity (c.1600) through shortening of self-conceit (1580s).
