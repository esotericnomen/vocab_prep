time zone (n.)

by 1885, from time (n.) + zone (n.). As in Britain and France, the movement to regulate time
nationally came from the railroads.  <blockquote>  Previous to 1883 the methods of measuring time in
the United States were so varied and so numerous as to be ludicrous. There were 50 different
standards used in the United States, and on one road between New York and Boston, whose actual
difference is 12 minutes, there were three distinct standards of time. Even small towns had two
different standards one known as town or local time and the other railroad time.     ... At noon on
November 18, 1883, there was a general resetting of watches and clocks all over the United States
and Canada, and the four great time zones, one hour apart, into which the country was divided came
into being. So smoothly did the plan work that the general readjustment was accomplished without
great difficulty and it has worked satisfactorily ever since. [Railroad Trainman, 1909]
