egghead (n.)

also egg-head, 1907, bald person, from egg (n.) + head (n.). Sense of intellectual is attested from
1918, among Chicago newspapermen; popularized by U.S. syndicated columnist Stewart Alsop in 1952 in
reference to Adlai Stevenson's presidential campaign.    Adlai Stevenson once told what it was like
to be the rare intellectual in politics. Via ovicapitum dura est, he said, the way of the egghead is
hard. [New York Times, Oct. 28, 1982]
