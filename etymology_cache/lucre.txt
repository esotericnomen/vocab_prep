lucre (n.)

late 14c., from Latin lucrum gain, advantage, profit; wealth, riches, from PIE root *lau- gain,
profit (cognates: Greek apo-lanein to enjoy, Gothic launs, German lohn wages, reward, and possibly
Sanskrit lotam, lotram booty). Filthy lucre (Tit. i:11) is Tyndale's rendering of Greek aischron
kerdos.
