slog (n.)

1846, a hard hit, from slog (v.). Sense of spell of hard work is from 1888.


slog (v.)

1824, hit hard, probably a variant of slug (v.3) to strike. Sense of walk doggedly first recorded
1872. Related: Slogged; slogger; slogging.


slay (v.)

Old English slean to smite, strike, beat, also to kill with a weapon, slaughter (class VI strong
verb; past tense sloh, slog, past participle slagen), from Proto-Germanic *slahan, from root *slog-
to hit (cognates: Old Norse and Old Frisian sla, Danish slaa, Middle Dutch slaen, Dutch slaan, Old
High German slahan, German schlagen, Gothic slahan to strike). The Germanic words are from PIE root
*slak- to strike (cognates: Middle Irish past participle slactha struck, slacc sword).    Modern
German cognate schlagen maintains the original sense of to strike. Meaning overwhelm with delight
(mid-14c.) preserves one of the wide range of meanings the word once had, including, in Old English,
stamp (coins); forge (weapons); throw, cast; pitch (a tent), to sting (of a snake); to dash, rush,
come quickly; play (the harp); gain by conquest.


slug (n.2)

lead bit, 1620s, perhaps a special use of slug (n.1), perhaps on some supposed resemblance. Meaning
token or counterfeit coin first recorded 1881; meaning strong drink first recorded 1756, perhaps
from slang fire a slug take a drink, though it also may be related to Irish slog swallow. Journalism
sense is from 1925, originally a short guideline for copy editors at the head of a story.
