insatiable (adj.)

early 15c., insaciable, from Old French insaciable (13c.), or directly from Late Latin insatiabilis
not to be satisfied, from in- not, opposite of (see in- (1)) + satiabilis, from satiare (see
satiate). Related: Insatiably.


insatiability (n.)

1650s, from Late Latin insatiabilitas, from insatiabilis (see insatiable).


unsatiable (adj.)

late 14c., from un- (1) not + satiable (adj.). Since 17c. the usual form is insatiable.


indigence (n.)

late 14c., from Old French indigence indigence, need, privation (13c.), from Latin indigentia need,
want; insatiable desire, from indigentem (nominative indigens), present participle of indigere to
need, from indu in, within + egere be in need, want, from PIE *eg- to lack (cognates: Old Norse ekla
want, lack, Old High German eccherode thin, weak).


sad (adj.)

Old English s&aelig;d sated, full, having had one's fill (of food, drink, fighting, etc.), weary of,
from Proto-Germanic *sathaz (cognates: Old Norse sa&eth;r, Middle Dutch sat, Dutch zad, Old High
German sat, German satt, Gothic sa&thorn;s satiated, sated, full), from PIE *seto- (cognates: Latin
satis enough, sufficient, Greek hadros thick, bulky, Old Church Slavonic sytu, Lithuanian sotus
satiated, Old Irish saith satiety, sathach sated), from root *sa- to satisfy (cognates: Sanskrit
a-sinvan insatiable).    Sense development passed through the meaning heavy, ponderous (i.e. full
mentally or physically), and weary, tired of before emerging c.1300 as unhappy. An alternative
course would be through the common Middle English sense of steadfast, firmly established, fixed (as
in sad-ware tough pewter vessels) and serious to grave. In the main modern sense, it replaced Old
English unrot, negative of rot cheerful, glad.    Meaning very bad is from 1690s. Slang sense of
inferior, pathetic is from 1899; sad sack is 1920s, popularized by World War II armed forces
(specifically by cartoon character invented by Sgt. George Baker, 1942, and published in U.S. Armed
Forces magazine Yank), probably a euphemistic shortening of common military slang phrase sad sack of
shit.
