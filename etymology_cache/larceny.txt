larceny (n.)

late 15c., with -y (3) + Anglo-French larcin (late 13c.), from Old French larrecin, larcin theft,
robbery (11c.), from Latin latrocinium robbery, freebooting, highway-robbery, piracy, from latro
robber, bandit, also hireling, mercenary, ultimately from a Greek source akin to latron pay, hire,
wages, from a suffixed form of PIE root *le- (1) to get.


larcenist (n.)

1803, from larceny + -ist. Earlier was larcener (1630s).


larcenous (adj.)

1742, from larceny + -ous.


-latry

word-forming element meaning worship of, used as an element in native formations from 19c. (such as
bardolatry), from Greek -latreia worship, service paid to the gods, hired labor, related to latron
(n.) pay, hire, latris servant, worshipper, from PIE *le- (1) to get (see larceny).


burglar (n.)

1540s, shortened from Anglo-Latin burglator (late 13c.), earlier burgator, from Medieval Latin
burgator burglar, from burgare to break open, commit burglary, from Latin burgus fortress, castle, a
Germanic loan-word akin to borough. The intrusive -l- is perhaps from influence of Latin latro thief
(see larceny). The native word, Old English burgh-breche, might have influenced the word.


celery (n.)

1660s, from French c&eacute;leri (17c., originally sceleri d'Italie), said by French sources to be
from Italian (Lombard dialect) seleri (singular selero), from Late Latin selinon, from Greek selinon
parsley, of uncertain origin.    [O]ne day, in a weak and hungry moment, my roommate and I succumbed
to a bit of larceny. A greengrocer's truck had parked down the street and was left unattended. We
grabbed the first crate we could off the back. It turned out to be celery. For two days we ate
nothing but celery and used up more calories chewing than we realized in energy. Damn it, I said to
my roommate, What're we going to do? We can't starve. That's funny, he replied. I thought we could.
