dulcet (adj.)

late 14c., from Old French doucet, diminutive of doux sweet, earlier dulz, from Latin dulcis, from
PIE *dlk-wi-, suffixed form of root *dlk-u- sweet (compare glucose).


dolce far niente

1814, from Italian, literally sweet doing nothing. The Latin roots are dulcis sweet (see dulcet),
facere to make, do (see factitious), and nec entem, literally not a being.    This phrase, frequent
enough in English literature, does not seem to occur in any Italian author of note. Howells says
that he found it current among Neapolitan lazzaroni, but it is not included in any collection of
Italian proverbial sayings. [Walsh]


billet-doux (n.)

also billet doux, 1670s, love letter, French, literally sweet note, from billet document, note
(14c., diminutive of bille; see bill (n.1)) + doux sweet, from Latin dulcis (see dulcet).
