holster (n.)

leather case for a pistol, 1660s, probably from Old English heolster, earlier helustr concealment,
hiding place, from Proto-Germanic *hulfti- (cognates: Old High German hulft cover, case, sheath, Old
Norse hulstr case, sheath, Middle Dutch holster, German Holfster holster), from PIE *kel- (2) to
cover, to hide (see cell). Intermediate forms are wanting, and the modern word could as well be from
the Norse or Dutch cognates.
