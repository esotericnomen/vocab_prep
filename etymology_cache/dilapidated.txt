Skeat is responsible for the prevailing modern view that it probably comes from Low German, from a
source such as Middle Low German laisch weak, feeble, tired, modern Low German l&auml;&ouml;sig,
early modern Dutch leuzig, all of which may go back to the PIE root *(s)leg- slack. According to
Weekley, the -z- sound disqualifies a connection with French lass&eacute; tired or German lassig
lazy, weary, tired. A supposed dialectal meaning naught, bad, if it is the original sense, may tie
the word to Old Norse lasenn dilapidated, lasm&oslash;yrr decrepit, fragile, root of Icelandic las-
fur&eth;a ailing, las-leiki ailment. Lazy Susan is from 1917. Grose (Dictionary of the Vulgar
Tongue, 1788) has Lazy Man's Load: Lazy people frequently take up more than they can safely carry,
to save the trouble of coming a second time.
