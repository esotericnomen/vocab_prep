supercilious (adj.)

1520s, lofty with pride, haughtily contemptuous, from Latin superciliosus haughty, arrogant, from
supercilium haughty demeanor, pride, literally eyebrow (via notion of raising the eyebrow to express
haughtiness), from super above (see super-) + second element akin to cilium eyelid, related to
celare to cover, hide, from PIE root *kel- (2) to conceal (see cell).  <blockquote>  Since cilium is
more recent than supercilium, the former can be interpreted as a back-formation to the latter ....
If indeed derived from the root *kel- 'to hide', we must still assume that a noun *kilium 'eyelid'
existed, since the eyelid can 'hide' the eye, whereas the eyebrow does not have such a function.
Thus, supercilium may originally have meant 'what is above the cilium'. [Michiel de Vaan,
Etymological Dictionary of Latin and the other Italic Languages, Leiden, 2008]  </blockquote>
