waive (v.)

c.1300, deprive of legal protection, from Anglo-French weyver to abandon, waive (Old French guever
to abandon, give back), probably from a Scandinavian source akin to Old Norse veifa to swing about,
from Proto-Germanic *waif- (see waif). In Middle English legal language, used of rights, goods, or
women.  <blockquote>  If the defendant be a woman, the proceeding is called a waiver; for as women
were not sworn to the law by taking the oath of allegiance in the leet (as men anciently were when
of the age of twelve years and upwards), they could not properly be outlawed, but were said to be
waived, i.e., derelicta, left out, or not regarded. [from section subtitled Outlawry in J.J.S.
Wharton, Law-Lexicon, or Dictionary of Jurisprudence, London, 1867]  </blockquote>  Related: Waived;
