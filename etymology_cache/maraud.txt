maraud (v.)

1690s, from French marauder (17c.), from Middle French maraud rascal (15c.), of unknown origin,
perhaps from French dialectal maraud tomcat, echoic of its cry. A word popularized in several
languages during the Thirty Years War (Spanish merodear, German marodiren, marodieren to maraud,
marodebruder straggler, deserter) by punning association with Count M&eacute;rode, imperialist
general. Related: Marauded; marauding.
