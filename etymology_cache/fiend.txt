fiend (n.)

Old English feond enemy, foe, originally present participle of feogan to hate, from Proto-Germanic
*fijand- hating, hostile (cognates: Old Frisian fiand enemy, Old Saxon fiond, Middle Dutch viant,
Dutch vijand enemy, Old Norse fjandi, Old High German fiant, Gothic fijands), from suffixed form of
PIE root *pe(i)- to hurt (source also of Gothic faian to blame; see passion).    As spelling
suggests, it was originally the opposite of friend, but the word began to be used in Old English for
Satan (as the enemy of mankind), which shifted its sense to diabolical person (early 13c.). The old
sense of the word devolved to foe, then to the imported word enemy. For spelling with -ie- see
field. Meaning devotee (of whatever is indicated), as in dope fiend, is from 1865.
