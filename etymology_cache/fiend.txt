Old English feond enemy, foe, originally present participle of feogan to hate, from Proto-Germanic
*fijand- hating, hostile (cognates: Old Frisian fiand enemy, Old Saxon fiond, Middle Dutch viant,
Dutch vijand enemy, Old Norse fjandi, Old High German fiant, Gothic fijands), from suffixed form of
PIE root *pe(i)- to hurt (source also of Gothic faian to blame; see <a
href=/index.php?term=passion&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>passion</a>).  <br /><br />
As spelling suggests, it was originally the opposite of <a
href=/index.php?term=friend&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>friend</a>, but the word
began to be used in Old English for Satan (as the enemy of mankind), which shifted its sense to
diabolical person (early 13c.). The old sense of the word devolved to <a
href=/index.php?term=foe&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>foe</a>, then to the imported
word <a href=/index.php?term=enemy&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>enemy</a>. For
spelling with -ie- see <a href=/index.php?term=field&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>field</a>. Meaning devotee (of whatever is indicated), as in dope fiend, is
from 1865.
