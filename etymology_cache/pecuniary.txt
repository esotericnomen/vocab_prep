pecuniary (adj.)

c.1500, from Latin pecuniarius pertaining to money, from pecunia money, property, wealth, from pecu
cattle, flock, from PIE root *peku- wealth, movable property, livestock (source of Sanskrit pasu-
cattle, Gothic faihu money, fortune, Old English feoh cattle, money).    Livestock was the measure
of wealth in the ancient world. For a possible parallel sense development in Old English, see fee,
and compare, evolving in the other direction, cattle. Compare also Welsh tlws jewel, cognate with
Irish tlus cattle, connected via notion of valuable thing.
