finicky (adj.)

1825, dainty, mincing, from finical too particular (1590s), perhaps from fine (adj.) + -ical as in
cynical, ironical. The -k- between the final -c- and a suffix beginning in -i, -y, or -e is an
orthographic rule to mark the pronunciation of -c- as k (compare picnicking, trafficking, panicky,
shellacked).


finical (adj.)
