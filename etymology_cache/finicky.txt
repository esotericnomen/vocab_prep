1825, dainty, mincing, from finical too particular (1590s), perhaps from <a
href=/index.php?term=fine&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>fine</a> (adj.) + <a
href=/index.php?term=-ical&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>-ical</a> as in cynical,
ironical. The -k- between the final -c- and a suffix beginning in -i, -y, or -e is an orthographic
rule to mark the pronunciation of -c- as k (compare picnicking, trafficking, panicky, shellacked).
