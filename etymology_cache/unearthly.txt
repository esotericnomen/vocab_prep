unearthly (adj.)

1610s, heavenly, sublime, from un- (1) not + earthly. Sense of ghostly, weird first recorded 1802.
Related: Unearthliness.


fey (adj.)

of excitement that presages death, from Old English f&aelig;ge doomed to die, fated, destines, also
timid, feeble; and/or from Old Norse feigr, both from Proto-Germanic *faigjo- (cognates: Old Saxon
fegi, Old Frisian fai, Middle Dutch vege, Middle High German veige doomed, also timid, German feige
cowardly), from PIE *peig- (2) evil-minded, hostile (see foe). Preserved in Scottish. Sense of
displaying unearthly qualities and disordered in the mind (like one about to die) led to modern
ironic sense of affected.


berserk (adj.)

1844, from berserk (n.) Norse warrior, by 1835, an alternative form of berserker (1822), a word
which was introduced by Sir Walter Scott, from Old Norse berserkr (n.) raging warrior of superhuman
strength; probably from *ber- bear + serkr shirt, thus literally a warrior clothed in bearskin. Thus
not from Old Norse berr bare, naked.    Thorkelin, in the essay on the Berserkir, appended to his
edition of the Krisini Saga, tells that an old name of the Berserk frenzy was hamremmi, i.e.,
strength acquired from another strange body, because it was anciently believed that the persons who
were liable to this frenzy were mysteriously endowed, during its accesses, with a strange body of
unearthly strength. If, however, the Berserk was called on by his own name, he lost his mysterious
form, and his ordinary strength alone remained. [Notes and Queries, Dec. 28, 1850]     The
adjectival use probably is from such phrases as berserk frenzy, or as a title (Arngrim the Berserk).
