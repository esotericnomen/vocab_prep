Old English l&aelig;ppa (plural l&aelig;ppan) skirt or flap of a garment, from Proto-Germanic *lapp-
(cognates: Old Frisian lappa, Old Saxon lappo, Middle Dutch lappe, Dutch lap, Old High German lappa,
German Lappen rag, shred, Old Norse leppr patch, rag), from PIE root *leb- be loose, hang down.  <br
/><br />  Sense of lower part of a shirt led to that of upper legs of seated person (c.1300). Used
figuratively (bosom, breast) from late 14c., as in lap of luxury, first recorded 1802. From 15c.-In
17c. the word (often in plural) was a euphemism for female pudendum, but this is not the source of
lap dance, which is first recorded 1993.<blockquote>To lap dance, you undress, sit your client down,
order him to stay still and fully clothed, then hover over him, making a motion that you have
perfected by watching Mister Softee ice cream dispensers. [Anthony Lane, review of Showgirls, New
Yorker, Oct. 16, 1995]</blockquote>That this is pleasure and not torment for the client is something
survivors of the late 20c. will have to explain to their youngers.
