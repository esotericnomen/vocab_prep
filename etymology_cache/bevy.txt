bevy (n.)

early 15c., collective noun of quails and ladies, from Anglo-French bev&eacute;e, of unknown origin.
One supposed definition of the word is a drinking bout, but this is perhaps a misprint of bever,
from Old French beivre (see beverage). Still, it's possible that the original sense could be a
company of birds gathered at a puddle or pool for drinking or bathing.
