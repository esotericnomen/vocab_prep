early 15c., collective noun of quails and ladies, from Anglo-French bev&eacute;e, of unknown origin.
One supposed definition of the word is a drinking bout, but this is perhaps a misprint of bever,
from Old French beivre (see <a href=/index.php?term=beverage&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>beverage</a>). Still, it's possible that the original sense could be a company
of birds gathered at a puddle or pool for drinking or bathing.
