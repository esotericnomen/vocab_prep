Florida

U.S. state, formerly a Spanish colony, probably from Spanish Pascua florida, literally flowering
Easter, a Spanish name for Palm Sunday, because the peninsula was discovered on that day (March 20,
1513) by the expedition of Spanish explorer Ponce de Le&oacute;n (1474-1521). From Latin floridus
(see florid).


florid (adj.)

1640s, strikingly beautiful, from French floride flourishing, from Latin floridus flowery, in bloom,
from flos flower (see flora). Sense of ruddy is first recorded 1640s. Meaning profusely adorned, as
with flowers, is from 1650s. Related: Floridly.


Asiatic (adj.)

1630s, from Latin Asiaticus (surname of Latin Corn. Scipio), from Greek Asiatikos, from Asia (see
Asia; also compare Asian). As a noun, by 1763. In ancient Rome, Asiatici oratores was florid and
overly ornate prose.


multiflora (n.)

1829, from Latin multiflora (rosa), from fem. of multiflorus, from multi- (see multi-) + flor-, stem
of flos (see florid).


rococo (adj.)

1836, old-fashioned, from French rococo (19c.), apparently a humorous alteration of rocaille
shellwork, pebble-work from Middle French roche rock, from Vulgar Latin *rocca stone. Specifically
of furniture or architecture of the time of Louis Quatorze and Louis Quinze, from 1841. If this is
correct, the reference is to the excessive use of shell designs in this lavish style. For
differentiation, see baroque. The general sense of tastelessly florid or ornate is from 1844.
Much of the painting, engraving, porcelain-work, etc., of the time has ... a real decorative charm,
though not of a very high order in art. Hence rococo is used attributively in contempt to note
anything feebly pretentious and tasteless in art or literature. [Century Dictionary, 1902]
