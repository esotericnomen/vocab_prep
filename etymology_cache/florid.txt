Florida

U.S. state, formerly a Spanish colony, probably from Spanish Pascua florida, literally flowering
Easter, a Spanish name for Palm Sunday, because the peninsula was discovered on that day (March 20,
1513) by the expedition of Spanish explorer Ponce de Le&oacute;n (1474-1521). From Latin floridus
(see florid).
