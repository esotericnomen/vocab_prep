paraphernalia (n.)

1650s, a woman's property besides her dowry, from Medieval Latin paraphernalia (short for
paraphernalia bona paraphernal goods), neuter plural of paraphernalis (adj.), from Late Latin
parapherna a woman's property besides her dowry, from Greek parapherna, neuter plural, from para-
beside (see para- (1)) + pherne dowry, related to pherein to carry (see infer). Meaning equipment,
apparatus is first attested 1791, from notion of odds and ends.


-ia

word-forming element in names of countries, diseases, flowers, from Latin and Greek -ia, which forms
abstract nouns of feminine gender. In paraphernalia, Mammalia, etc. it represents the Latin and
Greek plural suffix of nouns in -ium or -ion.    Chinese forms country names by adding guo country
to the stressed syllable of the place name, hence Meiguo America, from mei, the stressed syllable of
America (minus -r-, which does not exist in Chinese). Similarly Yingguo England, Faguo France.
Continent names are similarly formed, with zhou continent (such as Meizhou America (continent),
Feizhou Africa, Ouzhou Europe).
