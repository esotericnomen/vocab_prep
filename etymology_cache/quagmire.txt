quagmire (n.)

1570s, bog, marsh, from obsolete quag bog, marsh + mire (n.). Early spellings include quamyre
(1550s), quabmire (1590s), quadmire (c.1600). Extended sense of difficult situation, inescapable bad
position is recorded by 1766; but this seems to have been not in common use in much of 19c. (absent
in Century Dictionary, 1902), but revived in a narrower sense in reference to military invasions in
American English, 1965, with reference to Vietnam (popularized in the book title The Making of a
Quagmire by David Halberstam).
