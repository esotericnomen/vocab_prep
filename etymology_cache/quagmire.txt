1570s, bog, marsh, from obsolete <a href=/index.php?term=quag&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>quag</a> bog, marsh + <a href=/index.php?term=mire&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>mire</a> (n.). Early spellings include quamyre (1550s), quabmire (1590s),
quadmire (c.1600). Extended sense of difficult situation, inescapable bad position is recorded by
1766; but this seems to have been not in common use in much of 19c. (absent in Century Dictionary,
1902), but revived in a narrower sense in reference to military invasions in American English, 1965,
with reference to Vietnam (popularized in the book title The Making of a Quagmire by David
Halberstam).
