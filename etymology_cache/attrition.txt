attrition (n.)

1540s, abrasion, a scraping, from Latin attritionem (nominative attritio), literally a rubbing
against, noun of action from past participle stem of atterere to wear, rub away, figuratively to
destroy, waste, from ad- to (see ad-) + terere to rub (see throw (v.)). The earliest sense in
English is from Scholastic theology (late 14c.), sorrow for sin merely out of fear of punishment, a
minor irritation, and thus less than contrition. The sense of wearing down of military strength is a
World War I coinage (1914). Figurative use by 1930.
