attrition (n.)

1540s, abrasion, a scraping, from Latin attritionem (nominative attritio), literally a rubbing
against, noun of action from past participle stem of atterere to wear, rub away, figuratively to
destroy, waste, from ad- to (see ad-) + terere to rub (see throw (v.)). The earliest sense in
English is from Scholastic theology (late 14c.), sorrow for sin merely out of fear of punishment, a
minor irritation, and thus less than contrition. The sense of wearing down of military strength is a
World War I coinage (1914). Figurative use by 1930.


attrite (adj.)

worn down, 1620s, from Latin attritus, past participle of atterere (see attrition).


attrit (v.)

1956, U.S. Air Force back-formation from attrition which attained currency during the Vietnam War.
(A 17c. attempt at a verb produced attrite). Related: Attrited; attriting.


wear (v.)

Old English werian to clothe, put on, cover up, from Proto-Germanic *wazjan (cognates: Old Norse
verja, Old High German werian, Gothic gawasjan to clothe), from PIE *wos-eyo-, from root *wes- (4)
to clothe (cognates: Sanskrit vaste he puts on, vasanam garment; Avestan vah-; Greek esthes
clothing, hennymi to clothe, eima garment; Latin vestire to clothe; Welsh gwisgo, Breton gwiska; Old
English w&aelig;stling sheet, blanket; Hittite washshush garments, washanzi they dress).    The
Germanic forms were homonyms of the vb. for 'prevent, ward off, protect' (Goth. warjan, O.E. werian,
etc.), and this was prob. a factor in their early displacement in most of the Gmc. languages [Buck].
Shifted from a weak verb (past tense and past participle wered) to a strong one (past tense wore,
past participle worn) in 14c. on analogy of rhyming strong verbs such as bear and tear. Secondary
sense of use up, gradually damage (late 13c.) is from effect of continued use on clothes. To wear
down (transitive) overcome by steady force is from 1843. To wear off diminish by attrition or use is
from 1690s.
