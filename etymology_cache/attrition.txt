1540s, abrasion, a scraping, from Latin attritionem (nominative attritio), literally a rubbing
against, noun of action from past participle stem of atterere to wear, rub away, figuratively to
destroy, waste, from ad- to (see <a href=/index.php?term=ad-&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>ad-</a>) + terere to rub (see <a
href=/index.php?term=throw&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>throw</a> (v.)). The earliest
sense in English is from Scholastic theology (late 14c.), sorrow for sin merely out of fear of
punishment, a minor irritation, and thus less than contrition. The sense of wearing down of military
strength is a World War I coinage (1914). Figurative use by 1930.
