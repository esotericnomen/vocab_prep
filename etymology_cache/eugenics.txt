1883, coined (along with adjective eugenic) by English scientist Francis Galton (1822-1911) on
analogy of ethics, physics, etc. from Greek eugenes well-born, of good stock, of noble race, from
eu- good (see <a href=/index.php?term=eu-&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>eu-</a>) +
genos birth (see <a href=/index.php?term=genus&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>genus</a>).  <blockquote>The investigation of human eugenics, that is, of the
conditions under which men of a high type are produced. [Galton, Human Faculty, 1883]</blockquote>
