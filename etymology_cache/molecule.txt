1794, extremely minute particle, from French mol&eacute;cule (1670s), from Modern Latin molecula,
diminutive of Latin moles mass, barrier (see <a href=/index.php?term=mole&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>mole</a> (3)). A vague meaning at first; the vogue for the word (used until
late 18c. only in Latin form) can be traced to the philosophy of Descartes. First used of Modern
Latin molecula in modern scientific sense by Amedeo Avogadro (1811).
