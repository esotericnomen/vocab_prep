molecule (n.)

1794, extremely minute particle, from French mol&eacute;cule (1670s), from Modern Latin molecula,
diminutive of Latin moles mass, barrier (see mole (3)). A vague meaning at first; the vogue for the
word (used until late 18c. only in Latin form) can be traced to the philosophy of Descartes. First
used of Modern Latin molecula in modern scientific sense by Amedeo Avogadro (1811).
