incipient (adj.)

1660s, from Latin incipientem (nominative incipiens), present participle of incipere begin, take up,
from in- into, in, on, upon (see in- (2)) + -cipere, comb. form of capere to take (see capable).


incipit

opening word of a Latin book or manuscript, Latin, literally (here) begins, third person singular
present indicative of incipere (see incipient).


incipience (n.)

1864; see incipient + -ence. Incipiency is from 1817.


governance (n.)

late 14c., act or manner of governing, from Old French gouvernance government, rule, administration;
(rule of) conduct, from governer (see govern). Fowler writes that the word has now the dignity of
incipient archaism, but it might continue useful in its original sense as government comes primarily
to mean the governing power in a state.


insipient (adj.)

foolish, mid-15c., from Latin insipientem (nominative insipiens) unwise, foolish, from in- not (see
in- (1)) + sapientem (see sapient). Now mostly, or wholly, disused to avoid confusion with incipient
[OED].


initial (adj.)

1520s, of or pertaining to a beginning, from Middle French initial or directly from Latin initialis
initial, incipient, from initium a beginning, an entrance, from past participle stem of inire to go
into, enter upon, begin, from in- into, in (see in- (2)) + ire to go (see ion).
