protection, 1793, from Latin aegis, from Greek Aigis, the name of the shield of Zeus, said by
Herodotus to be related to aix (genitive aigos) goat, from PIE *aig- goat (cognates: Sanskrit ajah,
Lithuanian ozys he-goat), as the shield was of goatskin. Athene's aigis was a short goat-skin cloak,
covered with scales, set with a gorgon's head, and fringed with snakes. The exact use and purpose of
it is not now clear.  <blockquote>  The goatskin would be worn with the two forelegs tied in front
of the wearer's breast, or possibly with the head passed through an opening made at the neck, by the
removal of the animal's head. [F. Warre Cornish, ed., Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities,
London, 1898]  </blockquote>
