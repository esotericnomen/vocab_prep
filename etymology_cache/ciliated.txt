cilia (n.)

1715, from Latin cilia, plural of cilium eyelid, eyelash, perhaps related to celare to cover, hide,
from PIE root *kel- to conceal (see cell), but words for this part of the face can be tricky (see
brow). It sometimes is pluralized in English, which is an error. Related: Ciliated; ciliary;
ciliate.
