1715, from Latin cilia, plural of cilium eyelid, eyelash, perhaps related to celare to cover, hide,
from PIE root *kel- to conceal (see <a href=/index.php?term=cell&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>cell</a>), but words for this part of the face can be tricky (see <a
href=/index.php?term=brow&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>brow</a>). It sometimes is
pluralized in English, which is an error. Related: Ciliated; ciliary; ciliate.
