1866, reintroduced by English anthropologist Sir Edward Burnett Taylor (1832-1917), who defined it
(1871) as the theory of the universal animation of nature, from Latin anima life, breath, soul (see

Earlier sense was of doctrine that animal life is produced by an immaterial soul (1832), from German
Animismus, coined c.1720 by physicist/chemist Georg Ernst Stahl (1660-1734) based on the concept of
the <a href=/index.php?term=anima mundi&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>anima mundi</a>.
Animist is attested from 1819, in Stahl's sense; animisic is first recorded 1871.
