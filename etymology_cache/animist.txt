animism (n.)

1866, reintroduced by English anthropologist Sir Edward Burnett Taylor (1832-1917), who defined it
(1871) as the theory of the universal animation of nature, from Latin anima life, breath, soul (see
animus) + -ism.    Earlier sense was of doctrine that animal life is produced by an immaterial soul
(1832), from German Animismus, coined c.1720 by physicist/chemist Georg Ernst Stahl (1660-1734)
based on the concept of the anima mundi. Animist is attested from 1819, in Stahl's sense; animisic
is first recorded 1871.
