garbage (n.)

early 15c., giblets of a fowl, waste parts of an animal, later confused with garble in its sense of
siftings, refuse. Perhaps some senses derive from Old French garbe a bundle of sheaves, entrails,
from Proto-Germanic *garba- (cognates: Dutch garf, German garbe sheaf), from PIE *ghrebh- (1) to
seize, reach (see grab (v.)). Sense of refuse, filth is first attested 1580s; used figuratively for
worthless stuff from 1590s. Garbology study of waste as a social science is from 1976.
