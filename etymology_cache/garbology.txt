early 15c., giblets of a fowl, waste parts of an animal, later confused with <a

siftings, refuse. Perhaps some senses derive from Old French garbe a bundle of sheaves, entrails,
from Proto-Germanic *garba- (cognates: Dutch garf, German garbe sheaf), from PIE *ghrebh- (1) to
seize, reach (see <a href=/index.php?term=grab&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>grab</a>
(v.)). Sense of refuse, filth is first attested 1580s; used figuratively for worthless stuff from
1590s. Garbology study of waste as a social science is from 1976.
