1640s, from French bizarre odd, fantastic (16c.), originally handsome, brave, perhaps from Basque
bizar a beard (the notion being of bearded Spanish soldiers making a strange impression on the
French); alternative etymology traces it to Italian bizarro angry, fierce, irascible, from bizza fit
of anger.
