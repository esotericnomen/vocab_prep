bizarre (adj.)

1640s, from French bizarre odd, fantastic (16c.), originally handsome, brave, perhaps from Basque
bizar a beard (the notion being of bearded Spanish soldiers making a strange impression on the
French); alternative etymology traces it to Italian bizarro angry, fierce, irascible, from bizza fit
of anger.


antic (n.)

1520s, grotesque or comical gesture, from Italian antico antique, from Latin antiquus old (see
antique). Originally (like grotesque) a 16c. Italian word referring to the strange and fantastic
representations on ancient murals unearthed around Rome (especially originally the Baths of Titus,
rediscovered 16c.); later extended to any bizarre thing or behavior, in which sense it first arrived
in English. As an adjective in English from 1580s, grotesque, bizarre.


gonzo (adj.)

1971, American English, in Hunter S. Thompson's phrase gonzo journalism. Thompson in 1972 said he
got it from editor Bill Cardosa and explained it as some Boston word for weird, bizarre. Probably
from Italian gonzo rude, sottish, perhaps from Spanish ganso and ultimately from the Germanic word
for goose.


outlandish (adj.)

Old English utlendisc of a foreign country, not native, from utland foreign land, literally outland
(see out + land (n.)) + -ish. Sense of unfamiliar, strange, odd, bizarre (such as the customs of
foreigners may seem to natives) is attested from 1590s.
