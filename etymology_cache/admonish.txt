admonish (v.)

mid-14c., amonesten remind, urge, exhort, warn, give warning, from Old French amonester (12c.) urge,
encourage, warn, from Vulgar Latin *admonestare, from Latin admonere bring to mind, remind, suggest;
also warn, advise, urge, from ad- to (see ad-) + monere advise, warn (see monitor (n.)).    The -d-
was restored on Latin model. The ending was influenced by words in -ish (such as astonish, abolish).
