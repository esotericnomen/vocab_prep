c.1400, laberynthe (late 14c. in Latinate form laborintus) labyrinth, maze, figuratively bewildering
arguments, from Latin labyrinthus, from Greek labyrinthos maze, large building with intricate
passages, especially the structure built by Daedelus to hold the Minotaur near Knossos in Crete,
from a pre-Greek language; perhaps related to Lydian labrys double-edged axe, symbol of royal power,
which fits with the theory that the labyrinth was originally the royal Minoan palace on Crete and
meant palace of the double-axe. Used in English for maze early 15c., and in figurative sense of
confusing state of affairs (1540s).
