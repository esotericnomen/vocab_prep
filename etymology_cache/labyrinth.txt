labyrinth (n.)

c.1400, laberynthe (late 14c. in Latinate form laborintus) labyrinth, maze, figuratively bewildering
arguments, from Latin labyrinthus, from Greek labyrinthos maze, large building with intricate
passages, especially the structure built by Daedelus to hold the Minotaur near Knossos in Crete,
from a pre-Greek language; perhaps related to Lydian labrys double-edged axe, symbol of royal power,
which fits with the theory that the labyrinth was originally the royal Minoan palace on Crete and
meant palace of the double-axe. Used in English for maze early 15c., and in figurative sense of
confusing state of affairs (1540s).


labyrinthine (adj.)

1630s; see labyrinth + -ine (1). Earlier adjective forms were labyrinthian (1580s); labyrinthial
(1540s).


clue (n.)

1590s, spelling variant of clew a ball of thread or yarn, in this sense with reference to the one
Theseus used as a guide out of the Labyrinth. The purely figurative sense of that which points the
way is from 1620s. As something which a bewildered person does not have, by 1948.


hid (v.)

past tense and alternative past participle of hide (v.1).    How to entangle, trammel up and snare
Your soul in mine, and labyrinth you there  Like the hid scent in an unbudded rose?  Aye, a sweet
kiss -- you see your mighty woes.  [Keats, Lamia]


Daedalus

father of Icarus in Greek mythology, builder of the Cretan labyrinth, from Greek Daidalos, literally
the cunning worker, from daidallein to work artfully.


maze (n.)

c.1300, delusion, bewilderment (also as a verb, stupefy, daze), possibly from Old English
*m&aelig;s, which is suggested by the compound amasod amazed and verb amasian to confound, confuse
(see amaze). Perhaps related to Norwegian dialectal mas exhausting labor, Swedish masa to be slow or
sluggish. Meaning labyrinth first recorded late 14c.
