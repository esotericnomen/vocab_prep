yield (v.)

Old English gieldan (West Saxon), geldan (Anglian) to pay, pay for; reward, render; worship, serve,
sacrifice to (class III strong verb; past tense geald, past participle golden), from Proto-Germanic
*geldan pay (cognates: Old Saxon geldan to be worth, Old Norse gjaldo to repay, return, Middle Dutch
ghelden, Dutch gelden to cost, be worth, concern, Old High German geltan, German gelten to be worth,
Gothic fra-gildan to repay, requite).    From PIE *gheldh- to pay, a root found only in Balto-Slavic
and Germanic (and Old Church Slavonic &#382;ledo, Lithuanian geliuoti might be Germanic loan-words).
[T]he only generally surviving senses on the Continent are 'to be worth; to be valid, to concern,
apply to,' which are not represented at all in the English word [OED]; sense development in English
comes via use of this word to translate Latin reddere, French rendre. Sense of give in return for
labor or capital invested is from early 14c. Intransitive sense of give oneself up, submit,
surrender (to a foe) is from c.1300. Related to Middle Low German and Middle Dutch gelt, Dutch geld,
German Geld money. Related: Yielded; yielding.
