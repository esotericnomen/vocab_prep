evoke (v.)

1620s, from French &eacute;voquer or directly from Latin evocare call out, rouse, summon (see
evocation). Often more or less with a sense of calling spirits, or being called by them. Related:
Evoked; evokes; evoking.


evocative (adj.)

1650s, from Late Latin evocativus pertaining to summoning, from Latin evocatus, past participle of
evocare (see evoke).


erogenous (adj.)

formed 1889 from Greek eros sexual love (see Eros) + -genous producing. A slightly earlier variant
was erogenic (1887), from French &eacute;rog&eacute;nique. Both, as OED laments, are improperly
formed. Erogenous zone attested by 1905.    In this connection reference may be made to the well-
known fact that in some hysterical subjects there are so-called erogenous zones simple pressure on
which suffices to evoke the complete orgasm. There is, perhaps, some significance, from our present
point of view, in the fact that, as emphasized by Savill (Hysterical Skin Symptoms, Lancet, January
30 1904) the skin is one of the very best places to study hysteria. [Havelock Ellis, Studies in the
Psychology of Sex, 1914]
