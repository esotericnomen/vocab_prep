recline (v.)

early 15c., from Old French recliner rest, lay; bend, lean over (13c.) and directly from Latin
reclinare to bend back, to lean back; cause to lean, from re- back, against (see re-) + clinare to
bend, from PIE *klei-n-, suffixed form of *klei to lean (see lean (v.)). Related: Reclined;
reclining.  <blockquote> Recline is always as strong as lean, and generally stronger, indicating a
more completely recumbent position, and approaching lie. [Century Dictionary]</blockquote>
