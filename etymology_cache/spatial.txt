1975, from French fractal, from Latin fractus interrupted, irregular, literally broken, past

Les Objets Fractals.Many important spatial patterns of Nature are either irregular or fragmented to
such an extreme degree that ... classical geometry ... is hardly of any help in describing their
form. ... I hope to show that it is possible in many cases to remedy this absence of geometric
representation by using a family of shapes I propose to call fractals -- or fractal sets.
