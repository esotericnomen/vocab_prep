callow (adj.)

Old English calu bare, bald, from Proto-Germanic *kalwa- (cognates: Middle Dutch calu, Dutch kaal,
Old High German kalo, German Kahl), from PIE root *gal- (1) bald, naked (cognates: Russian golyi
smooth, bald). From young birds with no feathers, meaning extended to any young inexperienced thing
or creature (1570s). Apparently not related to Latin calvus bald.
