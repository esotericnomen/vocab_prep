candor (n.)

openness of mind, impartiality, frankness, c.1600, from Latin candor purity, openness, originally
whiteness, from candere to shine, to be white (see candle). Borrowed earlier in English (c.1500)
with the Latin literal sense extreme whiteness.


ballpark (n.)

baseball stadium, 1899, from (base)ball + park (n.). Figurative sense of acceptable range of
approximation first recorded 1954, originally in the jargon of atomic weapons scientists, perhaps
originally referring to area within which a missile was expected to return to earth; the reference
is to broad but reasonably predictable dimensions.    The result, according to the author's
estimate, is a stockpile equivalent to one billion tons of TNT. Assuming this estimate is in the
ball park, clearly there is valid reason for urging candor on the part of our government. [Ralph E.
Lapp, Atomic Candor, in Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, October 1954]


candour (n.)

chiefly British English spelling of candor (q.v.); for spelling, see -or.


disingenuous (adj.)

lacking in candor, 1650s, from dis- opposite of + ingenuous. Related: Disingenuously;
disingenuousness.


simplicity (n.)

late 14c., singleness of nature, unity, indivisibility; immutability, from Old French simplicite
(12c., Modern French simplicit&eacute;), from Latin simplicitatem (nominative simplicitas) state of
being simple, frankness, openness, artlessness, candor, directness, from simplex (genitive
simplicis) simple (see simplex). Sense of ignorance is from c.1400; that of simplicity of
expression, plainness of style is early 15c.    Middle English also had simplesse, from French,
attested in English from mid-14c. in sense humility, lack of pride, late 14c. as wholeness, unity;
c.1400 as ignorance.
