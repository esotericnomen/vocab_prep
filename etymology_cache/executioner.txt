butcher (n.)

c.1300, from Anglo-French boucher, from Old French bochier butcher, executioner (12c., Modern French

other Germanic source (see buck (n.1)) or Celtic *bukkos he-goat. Figurative sense of brutal

execution (n.)

late 14c., carrying out, putting into effect; enforcement; performance (of an act), the carrying out
(of a  plan, etc.), from Anglo-French execucioun (late 13c.), Old French execucion a carrying out
(of an order, etc.), from Latin executionem (nominative executio) an accomplishing, noun of action
from past participle stem of exequi/exsequi to follow out, from ex- out (see ex-) + sequi follow
(see sequel).    Sense of act of putting to death (mid-14c.) is from Middle English legal phrases
such as don execution of deth carry out a sentence of death. Literal meaning action of carrying
something into effect is from late 14c. John McKay, coach of the woeful Tampa Bay Buccaneers (U.S.
football team), when asked by a reporter what he thought of his team's execution, replied, I think
it would be a good idea. Executor and executioner were formerly used indifferently, because both are
carrying out legal orders.
