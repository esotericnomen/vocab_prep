Old English bolt short, stout arrow with a heavy head; also crossbow for throwing bolts, from Proto-
Germanic *bultas (cognates: Old Norse bolti, Danish bolt, Dutch bout, German Bolzen), perhaps from
PIE root *bheld- to knock, strike (cognates: Lithuanian beldu I knock, baldas pole for striking).
<br /><br />  Applied since Middle English to other short metal rods (especially those with knobbed
ends). From the notion of an arrow's flight comes the lightning bolt (1530s). A bolt of canvas
(c.1400) was so called for its shape. Adverbial phrase bolt upright is from late 14c.
