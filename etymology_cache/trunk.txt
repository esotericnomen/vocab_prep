trunk (n.1)

mid-15c., box, case, from Old French tronc alms box in a church, also trunk of a tree, trunk of the
human body, wooden block (12c.), from Latin truncus trunk of a tree, trunk of the body, of uncertain
origin, perhaps originally mutilated, cut off. The meaning box, case is likely to be from the notion
of the body as the case of the organs. English acquired the main stem of a tree and torso of the
body senses from Old French in late 15c. The sense of luggage compartment of a motor vehicle is from
1930. Railroad trunk line is attested from 1843; telephone version is from 1889.
