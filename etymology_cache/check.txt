check (v.1)

late 15c., in chess, to attack the king; to put (the opponent's king) in check; earlier (late 14c.),
to stop, arrest; block, barricade; see check (n.).    A player in chess limits his opponent's
ability to move when he places his opponent's king in check. All the other senses seem to have
developed from the chess sense: To arrest, stop; then to hold in restraint (1620s); and finally to
hold up or control (an assertion, a person, etc.) by comparison with some authority or record,
1690s.    Hence, to check off (1839); to check up (1889); to check in or out (in a hotel, of a
library book, etc., by 1918). To check out (something) to look at, investigate is from 1959.
