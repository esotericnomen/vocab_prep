thanatology (n.)

scientific study of death, 1837, from thanato- death + -logy. In 1970s, some undertakers made a bid
to be called thanatologists; but from 1974 that word has been used principally in reference to
specialists in the needs of the terminally ill.


Athanasian (adj.)

1580s, from Athanasius, archbishop of Alexandria in the reign of Constantine. The name is Latin,
from Greek Athanasios, from athanatos immortal, from a- not, privative prefix, + thanatos death (see
thanatology).


euthanasia (n.)

c.1600, from Greek euthanasia an easy or happy death, from eu- good (see eu-) + thanatos death (see
thanatology). Sense of legally sanctioned mercy killing is first recorded in English 1869.


tansy (n.)

perennial herb native to northern Eurasia, mid-13c., from Old French tanesie (13c., Modern French
tanaisie), from Vulgar Latin *tanaceta (neuter plural mistaken for fem. singular), from Late Latin
tanacetum wormwood, from shortened form of Greek athanasia immortality, from athanatos immortal,
from a- not, privative prefix, + thanatos death (see thanatology). So called probably for its
persistence. English folklore associates it with pregnancy, either as an aid to contraception or to
provoke miscarriage.
