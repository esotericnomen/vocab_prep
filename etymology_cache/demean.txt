demean (v.)

lower in dignity, c.1600, perhaps from de- down + mean (adj.) and modeled on debase.
Indistinguishable in some uses from obsolete demean (see demeanor) which influenced it and may be
its true source. Related: Demeaned; demeaning.


demeaning (adj.)

1829, present participle adjective from demean (v.). Related: Demeaningly.


demeanor (n.)

late 15c., from obsolete Middle English demean handle, manage, conduct, later behave in a certain
way (early 14c.), from Old French demener (11c.) to guide, conduct; to live, dwell, from de-
completely (see de-) + mener to lead, direct, from Latin minare to threaten, in Late Latin to drive
(a herd of animals); see menace. Sense in English evolved from notion of conduct, manage (oneself).
Spelling changed by influence of nouns in -or, -our.


mien (n.)

facial expression, 1510s, probably a shortening of Middle English demean bearing, demeanor (see
demeanor) and influenced by Middle French mine appearance, facial expression, which is of unknown
origin, possibly Celtic (compare Breton min beak, muzzle, nose, Irish men mouth).
