soluble (adj.)

late 14c., capable of being dissolved, from Old French soluble expungable, eradicable (13c.), from
Late Latin solubilis that may be loosened or dissolved, from stem of Latin solvere loosen, dissolve
(see solve). Meaning capable of being solved is attested from 1705. Substances are soluble, not
solvable; problems can be either.

xantho-

before vowels xanth-, word-forming element meaning yellow, from Greek xanthos yellow of various
shades; used especially of hair and horses, of unknown origin. Used in scientific words; such as
xanthein (1857) soluble yellow coloring matter in flowers, xanthophyll (1838) yellow coloring matter
in autumn leaves. Also Huxley's Xanthochroi (1867) blond, light-skinned races of Europe (with okhros
pale).


insoluble (adj.)

late 14c., unable to be loosened, from Latin insolubilis that cannot be loosened, from in- not (see
in- (1)) + solubilis (see soluble). Figurative use, of problems, etc., is from late 14c.It was a
tacit conviction of the learned during the Middle Ages that no such thing as an insoluble question
existed. There might be matters that presented serious difficulties, but if you could lay them
before the right man -- some Arab in Spain, for instance, omniscient by reason of studies into the
details of which it was better not to inquire -- he would give you a conclusive answer. The real
trouble was only to find your man. [Gertrude Bell, The Desert and the Sown, 1907]
