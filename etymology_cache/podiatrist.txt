podiatry (n.)

1914, formed from Greek pod-, stem of pous foot (see foot (n.)) + iatreia healing, from iatros
physician (see -iatric). An attempt to supplant chiropody (see chiropodist) and distance the
practice from the popular impression of unskilled corn-cutters. The National Association of
Chiropodists changed its name to American Podiatry Association in 1958. Related: Podiatric;
podiatrist.
