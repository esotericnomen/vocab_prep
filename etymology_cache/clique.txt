clique (n.)

1711, a party of persons; a small set, especially one associating for exclusivity, from obsolete
French clique, originally (14c.) a sharp noise, also latch, bolt of a door, from Old French cliquer
click, clatter, crackle, clink, 13c., echoic. Apparently this word was at one time treated in French
as the equivalent of claque (q.v.) and partook of that word's theatrical sense.
