1711, a party of persons; a small set, especially one associating for exclusivity, from obsolete
French clique, originally (14c.) a sharp noise, also latch, bolt of a door, from Old French cliquer
click, clatter, crackle, clink, 13c., echoic. Apparently this word was at one time treated in French
as the equivalent of <a href=/index.php?term=claque&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>claque</a> (q.v.) and partook of that word's theatrical sense.
