Old English ordel, ordal, trial by physical test, literally judgment, verdict, from Proto-Germanic
noun *uz-dailjam (cognates: Old Saxon urdeli, Old Frisian urdel, Dutch oordeel, German urteil
judgment), literally that which is dealt out (by the gods), from *uzdailijan share out, related to
Old English ad&aelig;lan to deal out (see <a href=/index.php?term=deal&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>deal</a> (n.1)). Curiously absent in Middle English, and perhaps reborrowed
16c. from Medieval Latin or Middle French, which got it from Germanic.  <br /><br />  The notion is
of the kind of arduous physical test (such as walking blindfolded and barefoot between red-hot
plowshares) that was believed to determine a person's guilt or innocence by immediate judgment of
the deity, an ancient Teutonic mode of trial. English retains a more exact sense of the word; its
cognates in German, etc., have been generalized.  <br /><br />  Metaphoric extension to anything
which tests character or endurance is attested from 1650s. The prefix or- survives in English only
in this word, but was common in Old English and other Germanic languages (Gothic ur-, Old Norse or-,
etc.) and originally was an adverb and preposition meaning out.
