hear (v.)

Old English heran (Anglian), (ge)hieran, hyran (West Saxon) to hear, listen (to), obey, follow;
accede to, grant; judge, from Proto-Germanic *hauzjan (cognates: Old Norse heyra, Old Frisian hora,
Dutch horen, German h&ouml;ren, Gothic hausjan), perhaps from PIE *kous- to hear (see acoustic). The
shift from *-z- to -r- is a regular feature in some Germanic languages.    For spelling, see head
(n.); spelling distinction between hear and here developed 1200-1550. Old English also had the
excellent adjective hiersum ready to hear, obedient, literally hear-some with suffix from handsome,
etc. Hear, hear! (1680s) was originally imperative, used as an exclamation to call attention to a
speaker's words; now a general cheer of approval. Originally it was hear him!
