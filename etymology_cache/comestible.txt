1837, article of food, from French comestible (14c.), from Late Latin comestibilis, from Latin
comestus, past participle of comedere eat up, consume, from com- thoroughly (see <a
href=/index.php?term=com-&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>com-</a>) + edere to eat (see
<a href=/index.php?term=edible&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>edible</a>). It was
attested earlier as an adjective (late 15c.) meaning fit to eat but seems to have fallen from use
17c., and the word was reintroduced from French.
