comestible (n.)

1837, article of food, from French comestible (14c.), from Late Latin comestibilis, from Latin
comestus, past participle of comedere eat up, consume, from com- thoroughly (see com-) + edere to
eat (see edible). It was attested earlier as an adjective (late 15c.) meaning fit to eat but seems
to have fallen from use 17c., and the word was reintroduced from French.
