1650s, of or pertaining to the hair, from Latin capillaris of hair, from capillus hair (of the
head); perhaps related to caput head (but de Vaan finds this difficult on the formal side and far
from compelling, since capillus is a diminutive, and would mean 'little head', which hardly amounts
to 'hair'). Borrowed earlier as capillar (14c.). Meaning taking place in capillary vessels is from
1809. Capillary attraction attested from 1813. As a noun, capillary blood vessel, from 1660s.
