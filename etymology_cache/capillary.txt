capillary (adj.)

1650s, of or pertaining to the hair, from Latin capillaris of hair, from capillus hair (of the
head); perhaps related to caput head (but de Vaan finds this difficult on the formal side and far
from compelling, since capillus is a diminutive, and would mean 'little head', which hardly amounts
to 'hair'). Borrowed earlier as capillar (14c.). Meaning taking place in capillary vessels is from
1809. Capillary attraction attested from 1813. As a noun, capillary blood vessel, from 1660s.


capillarity (n.)

1806, from French capillarit&eacute;, from Latin capillaris (see capillary).


dishevel (v.)

originally an adjective, bare-headed, late 14c., variant (with muted final -e) of dishevely, from
Old French deschevele bare-headed, with shaven head, past participle adjective from descheveler to
disarrange the hair, from des- apart (see dis-) + chevel hair, from Latin capillus hair (see
capillary). Of the hair, dissheveled, mid-15c. OED says use as a verb is chiefly a back-formation
from disheveled.
