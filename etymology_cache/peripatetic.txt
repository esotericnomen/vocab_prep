peripatetic (adj.)

1560s in the philosophical sense, 1640s in the literal sense; see peripatetic (n.).


peripatetic (n.)

c.1400, disciple of Aristotle, from Old French perypatetique (14c.), from Latin peripateticus
pertaining to the disciples or philosophy of Aristotle, from Greek peripatetikos given to walking
about (especially while teaching), from peripatein walk up and down, walk about, from peri- around
(see peri-) + patein to walk, tread (see find (v.)). Aristotle's custom was to teach while strolling
through the Lyceum in Athens. In English, the philosophical meaning is older than that of person who
wanders about (1610s).


busker (n.)

itinerant entertainer, 1857, from busk (v.) to offer goods for sale only in bars and taprooms, 1851
(in Mayhew), perhaps from busk to cruise as a pirate, which was used in a figurative sense by 1841,
in reference to people living shiftless and peripatetic lives. Busker has been mistakenly derived
from buskin in the stage sense.
