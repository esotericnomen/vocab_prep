debonair (adj.)

c.1200, mild, gentle, kind courteous, from Old French debonaire, from de bon' aire of good race,
originally used of hawks, hence, thoroughbred (opposite of French demalaire). Used in Middle English
to mean docile, courteous, it became obsolete and was revived with an altered sense of pleasant,
affable (1680s).


air (n.2)

1590s, manner, appearance (as in an air of mystery); 1650s, assumed manner, affected appearance
(especially in phrase put on airs, 1781), from French air look, appearance, mien, bearing, tone (Old
French aire reality, essence, nature, descent, extraction, 12c.; compare debonair), from Latin ager
place, field (see acre) on notion of place of origin.    But some French sources connect this Old
French word with the source of air (n.1), and it also is possible these senses in English developed
from or were influenced by air (n.1); compare sense development of atmosphere and Latin spiritus
breath, breeze, also high spirit, pride, and the extended senses of anima.
