bully (n.)

1530s, originally sweetheart, applied to either sex, from Dutch boel lover; brother, probably a
diminutive of Middle Dutch broeder brother (compare Middle High German buole brother, source of
German Buhle lover; see brother (n.)).    Meaning deteriorated 17c. through fine fellow and
blusterer to harasser of the weak (1680s, from bully-ruffian, 1650s). Perhaps this was by influence
of bull (n.1), but a connecting sense between lover and ruffian may be in protector of a prostitute,
which was one sense of bully (though not specifically attested until 1706). The expression meaning
worthy, jolly, admirable (especially in 1864 U.S. slang bully for you!) is first attested 1680s, and
preserves an earlier, positive sense of the word.
