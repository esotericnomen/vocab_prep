mortuary, 1821, from French Morgue, originally a specific building in Paris where bodies were
exposed for identification:  <blockquote>  There is, in the most populous part of the French
metropolis, an establishment entitled La Morgue, destined for the reception and exposition of bodies
drowned in the Seine, and caught in nets, which are placed in different parts of the river for that
purpose. The object of this exposition is, that the deceased may be recognised by their friends or
relatives, and receive the rights of sepulture accordingly. The Morgue is open at all hours of the
day, to passengers of every description, and often displays at a time, five or six horrible
carcasses stretched, without covering, on an inclined platform, and subjected to the promiscuous
gaze of the mob. [American Review, January 1811]   </blockquote>  Before that it was the place where
new prisoners were displayed to keepers to establish their identification. Thus the name is believed
to be probably from French morgue haughtiness, originally a sad expression, solemn look, from Old
French morguer look solemnly, from Vulgar Latin *murricare to make a face, pout, from *murrum
muzzle, snout. The 1768 Dictionnaire Royal Fran&#231;ois-Anglois Et Anglois-Fran&#231;ois defines
French morgue both as A proud, big, haughty or stately look, stare, surliness, or surly look and A
little gratel room wherein a new prisoner is set, and must continue some hours, that the Jailer's
ordinary servants may the better take notice of his face.  <br /><br />  Adopted as a general term
in U.S., 1880s, replacing earlier dead house, etc. In newspaper slang, collection of pre-written
obituary material of living persons (1903), hence library of clips, photos, etc., 1918.
