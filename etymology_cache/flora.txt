(genitive floris) flower, from *flo-s-, Italic suffixed form of PIE *bhle- to blossom, flourish
(cognates: Middle Irish blath, Welsh blawd blossom, flower, Old English blowan to flower, bloom),
extended form of *bhel- (3) to thrive, bloom, possibly identical with *bhel- (2) to blow, swell (see

title of descriptive plant catalogues since 1640s, but popularized by Linnaeus in his 1745 study of
Swedish plants, Flora Suecica.
