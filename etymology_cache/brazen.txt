brazen (adj.)

Old English br&aelig;sen of brass, from br&aelig;s brass (see brass) + -en (2). The figurative sense
of hardened in effrontery is 1570s (in brazen-face), perhaps suggesting a face unable to show shame
(see brass). To brazen it out face impudently is from 1550s.


brassy (adj.)

impudent, 1570s, from brass + -y (2). Compare brazen. Sense of debased and pretentious is from
1580s, from brass as contrasted with gold; sense of strident and artificial is from 1865. Related:
Brassily; brassiness.


ore (n.)

12c., a merger of Old English ora ore, unworked metal (related to eor&thorn;e earth, see earth; and
cognate with Low German ur iron-containing ore, Dutch oer, Old Norse aurr gravel); and Old English
ar brass, copper, bronze, from Proto-Germanic *ajiz- (cognates: Old Norse eir brass, copper, German
ehern brazen, Gothic aiz bronze), from PIE root *aus- (2) gold (see aureate). The two words were not
fully assimilated till 17c.; what emerged has the form of ar but the meaning of ora.


effrontery (n.)

1715, from French effronterie, from effront&eacute; shameless, from Old French esfronte shameless,
brazen, probably from Late Latin effrontem (nominative effrons) barefaced, from Latin ex- out (see
ex-) + frontem (nominative frons) brow (see front (n.)).    Latin frontus had a sense of ability to
blush, but the literal sense of effrontery often has been taken to be putting forth the forehead.
Forehead in Johnson's Dictionary (1755) has a secondary sense of impudence; confidence; assurance;
audaciousness; audacity.
