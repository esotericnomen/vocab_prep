Old English br&aelig;sen of brass, from br&aelig;s brass (see <a
href=/index.php?term=brass&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>brass</a>) + <a
href=/index.php?term=-en&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>-en</a> (2). The figurative
sense of hardened in effrontery is 1570s (in brazen-face), perhaps suggesting a face unable to show
shame (see <a href=/index.php?term=brass&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>brass</a>). To
brazen it out face impudently is from 1550s.
