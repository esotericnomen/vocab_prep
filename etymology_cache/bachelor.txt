bachelor (n.)

c.1300, young man; also youthful knight, novice in arms, from Old French bacheler, bachelor,
bachelier (11c.) knight bachelor, a young squire in training for knighthood, also young man;
unmarried man, and as a university title, of uncertain origin, perhaps from Medieval Latin
baccalarius vassal farmer, adult serf without a landholding, one who helps or tends a baccalaria
field or land in the lord's demesne (according to old French sources, perhaps from an alteration of
vacca a cow and originally grazing land [Kitchin]). Or from Latin baculum a stick, because the
squire would practice with a staff, not a sword. Perhaps several independent words have become
confused in form [Century Dictionary]. Meaning in English expanded early 14c. to young unmarried
man, late 14c. to one who has taken the lowest degree in a university. Bachelor party as a pre-
wedding ritual is from 1882.
