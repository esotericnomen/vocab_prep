inordinate (adj.)

late 14c., not ordered, lacking order or regularity, from Latin inordinatus unordered, not arranged,
from in- not, opposite of (see in- (1)) + ordinatus, past participle of ordinare to set in order
(see order). Sense of immoderate, excessive is from notion of not kept within orderly limits.
Related: Inordinately; inordinateness.


ambition (n.)

mid-14c., from Middle French ambition or directly from Latin ambitionem (nominative ambitio) a going
around, especially to solicit votes, hence a striving for favor, courting, flattery; a desire for
honor, thirst for popularity, noun of action from past participle stem of ambire to go around (see
ambient).    Rarely used in the literal sense in English, where it carries the secondary Latin sense
of eager or inordinate desire of honor or preferment. In early use always pejorative, of inordinate
or overreaching desire; ambition was grouped with pride and vainglory.
