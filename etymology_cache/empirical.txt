empirical (adj.)

1560s, from empiric + -al (1).


philosophy (n.)

c.1300, knowledge, body of knowledge, from Old French filosofie philosophy, knowledge (12c., Modern
French philosophie) and directly from Latin philosophia and from Greek philosophia love of
knowledge, pursuit of wisdom; systematic investigation, from philo- loving (see philo-) + sophia
knowledge, wisdom, from sophis wise, learned; of unknown origin.Nec quicquam aliud est philosophia,
si interpretari velis, praeter studium sapientiae; sapientia autem est rerum divinarum et humanarum
causarumque quibus eae res continentur scientia. [Cicero, De Officiis]   <hr />   [Philosophical
problems] are, of course, not empirical problems; but they are solved through an insight into the
workings of our language, and that in such a way that these workings are recognized -- despite an
urge to misunderstand them. The problems are solved, not through the contribution of new knowledge,
rather through the arrangement of things long familiar. Philosophy is a struggle against the
bewitchment (Verhexung) of our understanding by the resources of our language. [Ludwig Wittgenstein,
Philosophical Investigations, 1953]  Meaning system a person forms for conduct of life is attested
from 1771.
