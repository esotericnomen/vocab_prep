1763, from French avalanche (17c.), from Romansch (Swiss) avalantze descent, altered (by metathesis
of -l- and -v-, probably influenced by Old French avaler to descend, go down) from Savoy dialect
lavantse, from Proven&ccedil;al lavanca avalanche, perhaps from a pre-Latin Alpine language (the
suffix -anca suggests Ligurian). As a verb, from 1872.
