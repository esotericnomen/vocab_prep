avalanche (n.)

1763, from French avalanche (17c.), from Romansch (Swiss) avalantze descent, altered (by metathesis
of -l- and -v-, probably influenced by Old French avaler to descend, go down) from Savoy dialect
lavantse, from Proven&ccedil;al lavanca avalanche, perhaps from a pre-Latin Alpine language (the
suffix -anca suggests Ligurian). As a verb, from 1872.


ravine (n.)

1760, deep gorge, from French ravin a gully (1680s, from Old French raviner to pillage, sweep down,
cascade), and from French ravine violent rush of water, gully worn by a torrent, from Old French
ravine violent rush of water, waterfall; avalanche; robbery, rapine, both ultimately from Latin
rapina act of robbery, plundering (see rapine); sense influenced by Latin rapidus rapid. Middle
English ravine meant booty, plunder, robbery from c.1350-1500. Compare ravening.
