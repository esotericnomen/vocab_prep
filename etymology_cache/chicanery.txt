chicanery (n.)

c.1600, legal quibbling, sophistry, from French chicanerie trickery, from Middle French chicaner to
pettifog, quibble (15c.), of unknown origin, perhaps from Middle Low German schikken to arrange,
bring about, or from the name of a golf-like game once played in Languedoc. Thornton's American
Glossary has shecoonery (1845), which it describes as probably a corruption of chicanery.
