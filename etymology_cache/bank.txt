bank (n.1)

financial institution, late 15c., from either Old Italian banca or Middle French banque (itself from
the Italian word), both meaning table (the notion is of the moneylender's exchange table), from a
Germanic source (compare Old High German bank bench); see bank (n.2).   Bank holiday is from 1871,
though the tradition is as old as the Bank of England. To cry all the way to the bank was coined
1956 by flamboyant pianist Liberace, after a Madison Square Garden concert that was packed with
patrons but panned by critics.
