frayed (adj.)

worn by rubbing, 1814, past participle adjective from fray (v.).


fray (n.)

mid-14c., feeling of alarm, shortening of affray (q.v.; see also afraid). Meaning a brawl, a fight
is from early 15c. (but late 14c. in Anglo-Latin). Fraymaker fighter, brawler is an excellent word
from a 1530s statute.


fray (v.)

wear out by rubbing, c.1400, from Middle French frayer to rub against, from Old French froiier rub,
scrape, from Latin fricare to rub, rub down (see friction). Related: Frayed; fraying.


frazzle (v.)

c.1825, to unravel (of clothing), from East Anglian variant of 17c. fasel to unravel, fray (as the
end of a rope), from Middle English facelyn to fray (mid-15c.), from fasylle fringe, frayed edge,
diminutive of Old English f&aelig;s fringe. Related: Frazzled, frazzling. Compare German Faser
thread, fiber, filament, Middle Dutch vese fringe, fiber, chaff. Probably influenced in form by fray
(v.). As a noun, from 1865, American English.


ravel (v.)

1580s, to untangle, disentangle, unwind (originally with out), also to entangle, become tangled or
confused, from Dutch ravelen to tangle, fray, rafelen to unweave, from rafel frayed thread. The
seemingly contradictory senses of this word (ravel and unravel are both synonyms and antonyms) are
reconciled by its roots in weaving and sewing: as threads become unwoven, they get tangled.
