a fawning; flattery, cringing courtesy, noun of action from past participle stem of aduliari to
flatter, from ad- to (see <a href=/index.php?term=ad-&amp;allowed_in_frame=0
class=crossreference>ad-</a>) + ulos tail, from PIE *ul- the tail (cognates: Sanskrit valah tail,
Lithuanian valai horsehair of the tail). The original notion is to wag the tail like a fawning dog
