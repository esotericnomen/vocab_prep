sphinx (n.)

monster of Greek mythology having a lion's (winged) body and a woman's head; she waylaid travelers
around Thebes and devoured those who could not answer her questions; Oedipus solved the riddle and
the Sphinx killed herself. In English from early 15c., from Latin Sphinx, from Greek Sphinx, said to
mean literally the strangler, a back-formation from sphingein to squeeze, bind (see sphincter).
There also was an Egyptian form (usually male and wingless); in reference to this it is attested in
English from 1570s; specific reference to the colossal stone one near the pyramids as Giza is
attested from 1610s. Transferred sense of person or thing of mysterious nature is from c.1600. The
proper plural would be sphinges. As adjectives in English, sphingal, sphingian, sphingine,
sphinxian, sphinxine, and sphinx-like all have been tried.
