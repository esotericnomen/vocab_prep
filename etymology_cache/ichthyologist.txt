ichthyology (n.)

1640s, Modern Latin, from Greek ikhthys fish + -ology. Related: Ichthyologist.


coelacanth (n.)

1857, from Modern Latin Coelacanthus (genus name, 1839, Agassiz), from Greek koilos hollow (from PIE
root *kel- (2); see cell) + akantha spine (see acrid). So called from the hollow fin rays supporting
the tail. Known only as a fossil, the most recent one from 70 million years ago, until discovered
living in the sea off the east coast of South Africa Dec. 22, 1938. The specimen was described by
Marjorie Courtney-Latimer, who wrote about it to S.African ichthyologist J.L.B. Smith.    I stared
and stared, at first in puzzlement. I did not know any fish of our own, or indeed of any seas like
that; it looked more like a lizard. And then a bomb seemed to burst in my brain, and beyond that
sketch and the paper of the letter, I was looking at a series of fishy creatures that flashed up as
on a screen, fishes no longer here, fishes that had lived in dim past ages gone, and of which only
fragmentary remains in rock are known. [J.L.B. Smith, Old Fourlegs: The Story of the Coelacanth,
1956]
