mid-15c., from Middle French demise, fem. past participle of d&eacute;mettre dismiss, put away, from
des- away (from Latin dis-) + Middle French mettre put, from Latin mittere let go, send (see <a
href=/index.php?term=mission&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 class=crossreference>mission</a>). Originally
transfer of estate by will, meaning extended 1754 to death because that's when this happens.
